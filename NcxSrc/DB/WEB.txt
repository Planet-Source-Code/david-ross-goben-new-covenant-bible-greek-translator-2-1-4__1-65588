010101 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
010102 Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers.
010103 Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram.
010104 Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon.
010105 Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse.
010106 Jesse became the father of King David. David became the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
010107 Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa.
010108 Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah.
010109 Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah.
010110 Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah.
010111 Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon.
010112 After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.
010113 Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor.
010114 Azor became the father of Sadoc. Sadoc became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.
010115 Eliud became the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob.
010116 Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
010117 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.
010118 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
010119 Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.
010120 But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
010121 She shall bring forth a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins."
010122 Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
010123 "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son. They shall call his name Immanuel;" which is, being interpreted, "God with us."
010124 Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;
010125 and didn't know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.
010201 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
010202 "Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him."
010203 When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
010204 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born.
010205 They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet,
010206 'You Bethlehem, land of Judah, are in no way least among the princes of Judah: for out of you shall come forth a governor, who shall shepherd my people, Israel.'"
010207 Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared.
010208 He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him."
010209 They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
010210 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
010211 They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
010212 Being warned in a dream that they shouldn't return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.
010213 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
010214 He arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,
010215 and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son."
010216 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men.
010217 Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
010218 "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; she wouldn't be comforted, because they are no more."
010219 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
010220 "Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child's life are dead."
010221 He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
010222 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,
010223 and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."
010301 In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,
010302 "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"
010303 For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight."
010304 Now John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
010305 Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.
010306 They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
010307 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
010308 Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!
010309 Don't think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
010310 "Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.
010311 I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
010312 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."
010313 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
010314 But John would have hindered him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"
010315 But Jesus, answering, said to him, "Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.
010316 Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.
010317 Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
010401 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
010402 When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward.
010403 The tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
010404 But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
010405 Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
010406 and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will put his angels in charge of you.' and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you don't dash your foot against a stone.'"
010407 Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not test the Lord, your God.'"
010408 Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
010409 He said to him, "I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me."
010410 Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.'"
010411 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.
010412 Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.
010413 Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
010414 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
010415 "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,
010416 the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, to them light has dawned."
010417 From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
010418 Walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
010419 He said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men."
010420 They immediately left their nets and followed him.
010421 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them.
010422 They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.
010423 Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
010424 The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them.
010425 Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.
010501 Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
010502 He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
010503 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
010504 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
010505 Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.
010506 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
010507 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
010508 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
010509 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
010510 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
010511 "Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
010512 Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
010513 "You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.
010514 You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden.
010515 Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.
010516 Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
010517 "Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill.
010518 For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.
010519 Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
010520 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
010521 "You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, 'You shall not murder;' and 'Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment.'
010522 But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca!' shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.
010523 "If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,
010524 leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
010525 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.
010526 Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny.
010527 "You have heard that it was said,  'You shall not commit adultery;'
010528 but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
010529 If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.
010530 If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.
010531 "It was also said, 'Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,'
010532 but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.
010533 "Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, 'You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,'
010534 but I tell you, don't swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
010535 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
010536 Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can't make one hair white or black.
010537 But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.
010538 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'
010539 But I tell you, don't resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
010540 If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.
010541 Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
010542 Give to him who asks you, and don't turn away him who desires to borrow from you.
010543 "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.'
010544 But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,
010545 that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
010546 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
010547 If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
010548 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
010601 "Be careful that you don't do your charitable giving before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
010602 Therefore when you do merciful deeds, don't sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
010603 But when you do merciful deeds, don't let your left hand know what your right hand does,
010604 so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
010605 "When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.
010606 But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
010607 In praying, don't use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.
010608 Therefore don't be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.
010609 Pray like this: 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.
010610 Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
010611 Give us today our daily bread.
010612 Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
010613 Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.'
010614 "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
010615 But if you don't forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
010616 "Moreover when you fast, don't be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
010617 But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;
010618 so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.
010619 "Don't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;
010620 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don't break through and steal;
010621 for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
010622 "The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
010623 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
010624 "No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can't serve both God and Mammon.
010625 Therefore, I tell you, don't be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
010626 See the birds of the sky, that they don't sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you of much more value than they?
010627 "Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan?
010628 Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin,
010629 yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.
010630 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won't he much more clothe you, you of little faith?
010631 "Therefore don't be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?', 'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we be clothed?'
010632 For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
010633 But seek first God's Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.
010634 Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day's own evil is sufficient.
010701 "Don't judge, so that you won't be judged.
010702 For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.
010703 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?
010704 Or how will you tell your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye;' and behold, the beam is in your own eye?
010705 You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye.
010706 "Don't give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
010707 "Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.
010708 For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
010709 Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
010710 Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?
010711 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
010712 Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
010713 "Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it.
010714 How narrow is the gate, and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it.
010715 "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
010716 By their fruits you will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
010717 Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.
010718 A good tree can't produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.
010719 Every tree that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.
010720 Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.
010721 Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
010722 Many will tell me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?'
010723 Then I will tell them, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.'
010724 "Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock.
010725 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn't fall, for it was founded on the rock.
010726 Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn't do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.
010727 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell--and great was its fall."
010728 It happened, when Jesus had finished saying these things, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,
010729 for he taught them with authority, and not like the scribes.
010801 When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
010802 Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."
010803 Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
010804 Jesus said to him, "See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
010805 When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,
010806 and saying, "Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented."
010807 Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
010808 The centurion answered, "Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
010809 For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and he comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
010810 When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, "Most certainly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith, not even in Israel.
010811 I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,
010812 but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
010813 Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed." His servant was healed in that hour.
010814 When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with a fever.
010815 He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him.
010816 When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;
010817 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: "He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases."
010818 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.
010819 A scribe came, and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
010820 Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
010821 Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."
010822 But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."
010823 When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.
010824 Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep.
010825 They came to him, and woke him up, saying, "Save us, Lord! We are dying!"
010826 He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
010827 The men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
010828 When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.
010829 Behold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
010830 Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.
010831 The demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs."
010832 He said to them, "Go!" They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
010833 Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.
010834 Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.
010901 He entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city.
010902 Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you."
010903 Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man blasphemes."
010904 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
010905 For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Get up, and walk?'
010906 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." (then he said to the paralytic), "Get up, and take up your mat, and go up to your house."
010907 He arose and departed to his house.
010908 But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
010909 As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, "Follow me." He got up and followed him.
010910 It happened as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
010911 When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
010912 When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
010913 But you go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
010914 Then John's disciples came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?"
010915 Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
010916 No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.
010917 Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
010918 While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
010919 Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples.
010920 Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment;
010921 for she said within herself, "If I just touch his garment, I will be made well."
010922 But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, "Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well." And the woman was made well from that hour.
010923 When Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,
010924 he said to them, "Make room, because the girl isn't dead, but sleeping." They were ridiculing him.
010925 But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
010926 The report of this went out into all that land.
010927 As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, "Have mercy on us, son of David!"
010928 When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They told him, "Yes, Lord."
010929 Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it done to you."
010930 Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, "See that no one knows about this."
010931 But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.
010932 As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him.
010933 When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
010934 But the Pharisees said, "By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons."
010935 Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
010936 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.
010937 Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
010938 Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest."
011001 He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.
011002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;
011003 Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
011004 Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
011005 Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying, "Don't go among the Gentiles, and don't enter into any city of the Samaritans.
011006 Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
011007 As you go, preach, saying, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!'
011008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.
011009 Don't take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts.
011010 Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.
011011 Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.
011012 As you enter into the household, greet it.
011013 If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn't worthy, let your peace return to you.
011014 Whoever doesn't receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.
011015 Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
011016 "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
011017 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
011018 Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.
011019 But when they deliver you up, don't be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.
011020 For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
011021 "Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
011022 You will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.
011023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.
011024 "A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.
011025 It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!
011026 Therefore don't be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known.
011027 What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
011028 Don't be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
011029 "Aren't two sparrows sold for an assarion coin? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father's will,
011030 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
011031 Therefore don't be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
011032 Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
011033 But whoever denies me before men, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
011034 "Don't think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn't come to send peace, but a sword.
011035 For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
011036 A man's foes will be those of his own household.
011037 He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn't worthy of me.
011038 He who doesn't take his cross and follow after me, isn't worthy of me.
011039 He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
011040 He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.
011041 He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. He who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.
011042 Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward."
011101 It happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
011102 Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples
011103 and said to him, "Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?"
011104 Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:
011105 the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
011106 Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me."
011107 As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
011108 But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in king's houses.
011109 But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.
011110 For this is he, of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
011111 Most certainly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
011112 From the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
011113 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
011114 If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.
011115 He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
011116 "But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions
011117 and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you didn't dance. We mourned for you, and you didn't lament.'
011118 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
011119 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her children."
011120 Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they didn't repent.
011121 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
011122 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
011123 You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to Hades. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
011124 But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for you."
011125 At that time, Jesus answered, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants.
011126 Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
011127 All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him.
011128 "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.
011129 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for your souls.
011130 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
011201 At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
011202 But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, "Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
011203 But he said to them, "Haven't you read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;
011204 how he entered into the house of God, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
011205 Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?
011206 But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
011207 But if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless.
011208 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
011209 He departed there, and went into their synagogue.
011210 And behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?" that they might accuse him.
011211 He said to them, "What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won't he grab on to it, and lift it out?
011212 Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day."
011213 Then he told the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other.
011214 But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him.
011215 Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,
011216 and commanded them that they should not make him known:
011217 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
011218 "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit on him. He will proclaim justice to the nations.
011219 He will not strive, nor shout; neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
011220 He won't break a bruised reed. He won't quench a smoking flax, until he leads justice to victory.
011221 In his name, the nations will hope."
011222 Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw.
011223 All the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Can this be the son of David?"
011224 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."
011225 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
011226 If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
011227 If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
011228 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
011229 Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.
011230 "He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesn't gather with me, scatters.
011231 Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.
011232 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.
011233 "Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.
011234 You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
011235 The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things.
011236 I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.
011237 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."
011238 Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
011239 But he answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
011240 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
011241 The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.
011242 The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here.
011243 But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and doesn't find it.
011244 Then he says, 'I will return into my house from which I came out,' and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.
011245 Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation."
011246 While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
011247 One said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you."
011248 But he answered him who spoke to him, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"
011249 He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!
011250 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother."
011301 On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.
011302 Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.
011303 He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold, a farmer went out to sow.
011304 As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.
011305 Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn't have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth.
011306 When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.
011307 Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.
011308 Others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.
011309 He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
011310 The disciples came, and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
011311 He answered them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.
011312 For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken away even that which he has.
011313 Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don't see, and hearing, they don't hear, neither do they understand.
011314 In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says, 'By hearing you will hear, and will in no way understand; Seeing you will see, and will in no way perceive:
011315 for this people's heart has grown callous, their ears are dull of hearing, they have closed their eyes; or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and should turn again; and I would heal them.'
011316 "But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
011317 For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them.
011318 "Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.
011319 When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn't understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.
011320 What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;
011321 yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.
011322 What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
011323 What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."
011324 He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,
011325 but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat, and went away.
011326 But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.
011327 The servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?'
011328 "He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?'
011329 "But he said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.
011330 Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, "First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn."'"
011331 He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;
011332 which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."
011333 He spoke another parable to them. "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened."
011334 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn't speak to them,
011335 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world."
011336 Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field."
011337 He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
011338 the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one.
011339 The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
011340 As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age.
011341 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,
011342 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
011343 Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
011344 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
011345 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,
011346 who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
011347 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,
011348 which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.
011349 So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
011350 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth."
011351 Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered him, "Yes, Lord."
011352 He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things."
011353 It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.
011354 Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?
011355 Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?
011356 Aren't all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?"
011357 They were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house."
011358 He didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
011401 At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
011402 and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him."
011403 For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
011404 For John said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
011405 When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
011406 But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.
011407 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.
011408 She, being prompted by her mother, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer."
011409 The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,
011410 and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
011411 His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother.
011412 His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.
011413 Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
011414 Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
011415 When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, "This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food."
011416 But Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat."
011417 They told him, "We only have here five loaves and two fish."
011418 He said, "Bring them here to me."
011419 He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
011420 They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.
011421 Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
011422 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
011423 After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.
011424 But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
011425 In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
011426 When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It's a ghost!" and they cried out for fear.
011427 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying "Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid."
011428 Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters."
011429 He said, "Come!" Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.
011430 But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
011431 Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
011432 When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.
011433 Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, "You are truly the Son of God!"
011434 When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
011435 When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick,
011436 and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole.
011501 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
011502 "Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread."
011503 He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?
011504 For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'
011505 But you say, 'Whoever may tell his father or his mother, "Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,"
011506 he shall not honor his father or mother.' You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.
011507 You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
011508 'These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
011509 And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules made by men.'"
011510 He summoned the multitude, and said to them, "Hear, and understand.
011511 That which enters into the mouth doesn't defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."
011512 Then the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"
011513 But he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't plant will be uprooted.
011514 Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."
011515 Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us."
011516 So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand?
011517 Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?
011518 But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.
011519 For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.
011520 These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn't defile the man."
011521 Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
011522 Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!"
011523 But he answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away; for she cries after us."
011524 But he answered, "I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
011525 But she came and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, help me."
011526 But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
011527 But she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
011528 Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour.
011529 Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.
011530 Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,
011531 so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing--and they glorified the God of Israel.
011532 Jesus summoned his disciples and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way."
011533 The disciples said to him, "Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?"
011534 Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
011535 He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
011536 and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
011537 They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
011538 Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
011539 Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
011601 The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
011602 But he answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
011603 In the morning, 'It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.' Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can't discern the signs of the times!
011604 An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah." He left them, and departed.
011605 The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread.
011606 Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
011607 They reasoned among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."
011608 Jesus, perceiving it, said, "Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, 'because you have brought no bread?'
011609 Don't you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
011610 Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
011611 How is it that you don't perceive that I didn't speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
011612 Then they understood that he didn't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
011613 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?"
011614 They said, "Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
011615 He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
011616 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
011617 Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
011618 I also tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
011619 I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven."
011620 Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.
011621 From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
011622 Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you."
011623 But he turned, and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."
011624 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
011625 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.
011626 For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?
011627 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds.
011628 Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom."
011701 After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
011702 He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light.
011703 Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
011704 Peter answered, and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let's make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
011705 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
011706 When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.
011707 Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, and don't be afraid."
011708 Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
011709 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Don't tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
011710 His disciples asked him, saying, "Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
011711 Jesus answered them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,
011712 but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn't recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them."
011713 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.
011714 When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying,
011715 "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.
011716 So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him."
011717 Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me."
011718 Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
011719 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, "Why weren't we able to cast it out?"
011720 He said to them, "Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.
011721 But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting."
011722 While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,
011723 and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up." They were exceedingly sorry.
011724 When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter, and said, "Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma?"
011725 He said, "Yes." When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?"
011726 Peter said to him, "From strangers." Jesus said to him, "Therefore the children are exempt.
011727 But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and you."
011801 In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"
011802 Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the midst of them,
011803 and said, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
011804 Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
011805 Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,
011806 but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea.
011807 "Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!
011808 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.
011809 If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.
011810 See that you don't despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
011811 For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.
011812 "What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn't he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
011813 If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
011814 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
011815 "If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother.
011816 But if he doesn't listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
011817 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.
011818 Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
011819 Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
011820 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them."
011821 Then Peter came and said to him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?"
011822 Jesus said to him, "I don't tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.
011823 Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.
011824 When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
011825 But because he couldn't pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
011826 The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, 'Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!'
011827 The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.
011828 "But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
011829 "So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you!'
011830 He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.
011831 So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.
011832 Then his lord called him in, and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.
011833 Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?'
011834 His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.
011835 So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don't each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds."
011901 It happened when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
011902 Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
011903 Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
011904 He answered, "Haven't you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,
011905 and said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?'
011906 So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don't let man tear apart."
011907 They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?"
011908 He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.
011909 I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery."
011910 His disciples said to him, "If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry."
011911 But he said to them, "Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.
011912 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it."
011913 Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
011914 But Jesus said, "Allow the little children, and don't forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these."
011915 He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.
011916 Behold, one came to him and said, "Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
011917 He said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
011918 He said to him, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false testimony.'
011919 'Honor your father and mother.' And, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
011920 The young man said to him, "All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?"
011921 Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
011922 But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions.
011923 Jesus said to his disciples, "Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.
011924 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."
011925 When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"
011926 Looking at them, Jesus said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
011927 Then Peter answered, "Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?"
011928 Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
011929 Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.
011930 But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.
012001 "For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
012002 When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
012003 He went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
012004 To them he said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went their way.
012005 Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
012006 About the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them, 'Why do you stand here all day idle?'
012007 "They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' "He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.'
012008 When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.'
012009 "When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.
012010 When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius.
012011 When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,
012012 saying, 'These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!'
012013 "But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn't you agree with me for a denarius?
012014 Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.
012015 Isn't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?'
012016 So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen."
012017 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
012018 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
012019 and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up."
012020 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.
012021 He said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom."
012022 But Jesus answered, "You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to him, "We are able."
012023 He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
012024 When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
012025 But Jesus summoned them, and said, "You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
012026 It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.
012027 Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant,
012028 even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
012029 As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
012030 Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!"
012031 The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, "Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!"
012032 Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, "What do you want me to do for you?"
012033 They told him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
012034 Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him.
012101 When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
012102 saying to them, "Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me.
012103 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and immediately he will send them."
012104 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
012105 "Tell the daughter of Zion, behold, your King comes to you, humble, and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
012106 The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,
012107 and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.
012108 A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.
012109 The multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept shouting, "Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
012110 When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, "Who is this?"
012111 The multitudes said, "This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee."
012112 Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers' tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.
012113 He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers!"
012114 The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
012115 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the son of David!" they were indignant,
012116 and said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes. Did you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?'"
012117 He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
012118 Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
012119 Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, "Let there be no fruit from you forever!" Immediately the fig tree withered away.
012120 When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree immediately wither away?"
012121 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don't doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it would be done.
012122 All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive."
012123 When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?"
012124 Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
012125 The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?" They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
012126 But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet."
012127 They answered Jesus, and said, "We don't know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
012128 But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'
012129 He answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind, and went.
012130 He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, 'I go, sir,' but he didn't go.
012131 Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said to him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God before you.
012132 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn't believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn't even repent afterward, that you might believe him.
012133 "Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.
012134 When the season for the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.
012135 The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
012136 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way.
012137 But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
012138 But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and seize his inheritance.'
012139 So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
012140 When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?"
012141 They told him, "He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season."
012142 Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner. This was from the Lord. It is marvelous in our eyes?'
012143 "Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit.
012144 He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whoever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust."
012145 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.
012146 When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet.
012201 Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
012202 "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
012203 and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come.
012204 Again he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "Behold, I have made ready my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!"'
012205 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,
012206 and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.
012207 When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
012208 "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren't worthy.
012209 Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.'
012210 Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.
012211 But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn't have on wedding clothing,
012212 and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?' He was speechless.
012213 Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.'
012214 For many are called, but few chosen."
012215 Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.
012216 They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter who you teach, for you aren't partial to anyone.
012217 Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
012218 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?
012219 Show me the tax money." They brought to him a denarius.
012220 He asked them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"
012221 They said to him, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
012222 When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away.
012223 On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,
012224 saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.'
012225 Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.
012226 In like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
012227 After them all, the woman died.
012228 In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her."
012229 But Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
012230 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God's angels in heaven.
012231 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
012232 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?' God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
012233 When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
012234 But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
012235 One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.
012236 "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
012237 Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'
012238 This is the first and great commandment.
012239 A second likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
012240 The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."
012241 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
012242 saying, "What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "Of David."
012243 He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
012244 'The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'
012245 "If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
012246 No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth.
012301 Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
012302 saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses' seat.
012303 All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but don't do their works; for they say, and don't do.
012304 For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them.
012305 But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad, enlarge the fringes of their garments,
012306 and love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,
012307 the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi, Rabbi' by men.
012308 But don't you be called 'Rabbi,' for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers.
012309 Call no man on the earth your father, for one is your Father, he who is in heaven.
012310 Neither be called masters, for one is your master, the Christ.
012311 But he who is greatest among you will be your servant.
012312 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
012313 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
012314 "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for you don't enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter.
012315 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much of a son of Gehenna as yourselves.
012316 "Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.'
012317 You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
012318 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?'
012319 You blind fools! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
012320 He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it.
012321 He who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who was living in it.
012322 He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it.
012323 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.
012324 You blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!
012325 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.
012326 You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that its outside may become clean also.
012327 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
012328 Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
012329 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the righteous,
012330 and say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldn't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.'
012331 Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets.
012332 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.
012333 You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna?
012334 Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
012335 that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
012336 Most certainly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation.
012337 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!
012338 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
012339 For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
012401 Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
012402 But he answered them, "You see all of these things, don't you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down."
012403 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
012404 Jesus answered them, "Be careful that no one leads you astray.
012405 For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will lead many astray.
012406 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you aren't troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet.
012407 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.
012408 But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.
012409 Then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name's sake.
012410 Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another.
012411 Many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.
012412 Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold.
012413 But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
012414 This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
012415 "When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
012416 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
012417 Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house.
012418 Let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes.
012419 But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!
012420 Pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath,
012421 for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.
012422 Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.
012423 "Then if any man tells you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,' or, 'There,' don't believe it.
012424 For there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.
012425 "Behold, I have told you beforehand.
012426 If therefore they tell you, 'Behold, he is in the wilderness,' don't go out; 'Behold, he is in the inner chambers,' don't believe it.
012427 For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
012428 For wherever the carcass is, there is where the vultures gather together.
012429 But immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;
012430 and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
012431 He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
012432 "Now from the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.
012433 Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
012434 Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished.
012435 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
012436 But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
012437 "As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
012438 For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship,
012439 and they didn't know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
012440 Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left;
012441 two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken and one will be left.
012442 Watch therefore, for you don't know in what hour your Lord comes.
012443 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
012444 Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don't expect, the Son of Man will come.
012445 "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?
012446 Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.
012447 Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.
012448 But if that evil servant should say in his heart, 'My lord is delaying his coming,'
012449 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,
012450 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn't expect it, and in an hour when he doesn't know it,
012451 and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.
012501 "Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.
012502 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
012503 Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,
012504 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
012505 Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
012506 But at midnight there was a cry, 'Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!'
012507 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
012508 The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us  some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
012509 But the wise answered, saying, 'What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.'
012510 While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
012511 Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us.'
012512 But he answered, 'Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you.'
012513 Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.
012514 "For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them.
012515 To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey.
012516 Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.
012517 In like manner he also who got the two gained another two.
012518 But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
012519 "Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.
012520 He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.'
012521 "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
012522 "He also who got the two talents came and said, 'Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.'
012523 "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
012524 "He also who had received the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
012525 I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.'
012526 "But his lord answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn't sow, and gather where I didn't scatter.
012527 You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.
012528 Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.
012529 For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away.
012530 Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
012531 "But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
012532 Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
012533 He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
012534 Then the King will tell those on his right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
012535 for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in.
012536 I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.'
012537 "Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?
012538 When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?
012539 When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'
012540 "The King will answer them, 'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'
012541 Then he will say also to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;
012542 for I was hungry, and you didn't give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
012543 I was a stranger, and you didn't take me in; naked, and you didn't clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn't visit me.'
012544 "Then they will also answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn't help you?'
012545 "Then he will answer them, saying, 'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of the least of these, you didn't do it to me.'
012546 These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
012601 It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,
012602 "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
012603 Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
012604 They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him.
012605 But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people."
012606 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
012607 a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.
012608 But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?
012609 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
012610 However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? Because she has done a good work for me.
012611 For you always have the poor with you; but you don't always have me.
012612 For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
012613 Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her."
012614 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
012615 and said, "What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?" They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.
012616 From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
012617 Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
012618 He said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"
012619 The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.
012620 Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
012621 As they were eating, he said, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."
012622 They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, "It isn't me, is it, Lord?"
012623 He answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.
012624 The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
012625 Judas, who betrayed him, answered, "It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?" He said to him, "You said it."
012626 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
012627 He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, "All of you drink it,
012628 for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.
012629 But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's Kingdom."
012630 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
012631 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
012632 But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
012633 But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble."
012634 Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
012635 Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you." All of the disciples also said likewise.
012636 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."
012637 He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
012638 Then he said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me."
012639 He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire."
012640 He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What, couldn't you watch with me for one hour?
012641 Watch and pray, that you don't enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
012642 Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup can't pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done."
012643 He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
012644 He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.
012645 Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
012646 Arise, let's be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."
012647 While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people.
012648 Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him."
012649 Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
012650 Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
012651 Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
012652 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.
012653 Or do you think that I couldn't ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
012654 How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"
012655 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me.
012656 But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
012657 Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
012658 But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.
012659 Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;
012660 and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,
012661 and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"
012662 The high priest stood up, and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?"
012663 But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."
012664 Jesus said to him, "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."
012665 Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.
012666 What do you think?" They answered, "He is worthy of death!"
012667 Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,
012668 saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?"
012669 Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"
012670 But he denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what you are talking about."
012671 When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth."
012672 Again he denied it with an oath, "I don't know the man."
012673 After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known."
012674 Then he began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the man!" Immediately the rooster crowed.
012675 Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.
012701 Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
012702 and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
012703 Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
012704 saying, "I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? You see to it."
012705 He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.
012706 The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, "It's not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood."
012707 They took counsel, and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.
012708 Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this day.
012709 Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him upon whom a price had been set, whom some of the children of Israel priced,
012710 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."
012711 Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "So you say."
012712 When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
012713 Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how many things they testify against you?"
012714 He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.
012715 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.
012716 They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
012717 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?"
012718 For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.
012719 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
012720 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
012721 But the governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas!"
012722 Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?" They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"
012723 But the governor said, "Why? What evil has he done?" But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let him be crucified!"
012724 So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it."
012725 All the people answered, "May his blood be on us, and on our children!"
012726 Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.
012727 Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.
012728 They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.
012729 They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
012730 They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
012731 When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
012732 As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.
012733 They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say, "The place of a skull."
012734 They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.
012735 When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,
012736 and they sat and watched him there.
012737 They set up over his head the accusation against him written, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
012738 Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.
012739 Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
012740 and saying, "You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
012741 Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,
012742 "He saved others, but he can't save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.
012743 He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
012744 The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.
012745 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
012746 About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
012747 Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This man is calling Elijah."
012748 Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.
012749 The rest said, "Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him."
012750 Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
012751 Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
012752 The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
012753 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
012754 Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."
012755 Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
012756 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
012757 When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus' disciple came.
012758 This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.
012759 Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
012760 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
012761 Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
012762 Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,
012763 saying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: 'After three days I will rise again.'
012764 Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead;' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
012765 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can."
012766 So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.
012801 Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
012802 Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
012803 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
012804 For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
012805 The angel answered the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
012806 He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
012807 Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."
012808 They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
012809 As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
012810 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."
012811 Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.
012812 When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,
012813 saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
012814 If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."
012815 So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.
012816 But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
012817 When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.
012818 Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
012819 Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
012820 teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen.
020101 The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
020102 As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.
020103 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight!'"
020104 John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
020105 All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.
020106 John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
020107 He preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.
020108 I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."
020109 It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
020110 Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
020111 A voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
020112 Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
020113 He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.
020114 Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God,
020115 and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News."
020116 Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
020117 Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men."
020118 Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.
020119 Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.
020120 Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
020121 They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
020122 They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
020123 Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
020124 saying, "Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!"
020125 Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
020126 The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
020127 They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!"
020128 The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.
020129 Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
020130 Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
020131 He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.
020132 At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons.
020133 All the city was gathered together at the door.
020134 He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn't allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.
020135 Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there.
020136 Simon and those who were with him followed after him;
020137 and they found him, and told him, "Everyone is looking for you."
020138 He said to them, "Let's go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason."
020139 He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
020140 A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
020141 Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made clean."
020142 When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
020143 He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,
020144 and said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
020145 But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.
020201 When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.
020202 Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them.
020203 Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him.
020204 When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on.
020205 Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you."
020206 But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
020207 "Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
020208 Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason these things in your hearts?
020209 Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?'
020210 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the paralytic--
020211 "I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house."
020212 He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"
020213 He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them.
020214 As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he arose and followed him.
020215 It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.
020216 The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"
020217 When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
020218 John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?"
020219 Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast.
020220 But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.
020221 No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.
020222 No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins."
020223 It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.
020224 The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"
020225 He said to them, "Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry--he, and those who were with him?
020226 How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?"
020227 He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
020228 Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
020301 He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
020302 They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.
020303 He said to the man who had his hand withered, "Stand up."
020304 He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?" But they were silent.
020305 When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.
020306 The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
020307 Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,
020308 from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.
020309 He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn't press on him.
020310 For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.
020311 The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, "You are the Son of God!"
020312 He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.
020313 He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.
020314 He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
020315 and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
020316 Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;
020317 James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder;
020318 Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;
020319 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. He came into a house.
020320 The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
020321 When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, "He is insane."
020322 The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul," and, "By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons."
020323 He summoned them, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
020324 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
020325 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
020326 If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end.
020327 But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.
020328 Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;
020329 but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"
020330 --because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."
020331 His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.
020332 A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, "Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you."
020333 He answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
020334 Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!
020335 For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."
020401 Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.
020402 He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,
020403 "Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,
020404 and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.
020405 Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.
020406 When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
020407 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
020408 Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much."
020409 He said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."
020410 When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
020411 He said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,
020412 that 'seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.'"
020413 He said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?
020414 The farmer sows the word.
020415 The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.
020416 These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.
020417 They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.
020418 Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,
020419 and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
020420 Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times."
020421 He said to them, "Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn't it put on a stand?
020422 For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.
020423 If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."
020424 He said to them, "Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.
020425 For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him."
020426 He said, "The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,
020427 and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't know how.
020428 For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
020429 But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."
020430 He said, "How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?
020431 It's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,
020432 yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow."
020433 With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.
020434 Without a parable he didn't speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
020435 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let's go over to the other side."
020436 Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.
020437 A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.
020438 He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, "Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?"
020439 He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
020440 He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?"
020441 They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
020501 They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
020502 When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs.
020503 He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,
020504 because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.
020505 Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
020506 When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,
020507 and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don't torment me."
020508 For he said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
020509 He asked him, "What is your name?" He said to him, "My name is Legion, for we are many."
020510 He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
020511 Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.
020512 All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them."
020513 At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.
020514 Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. The people came to see what it was that had happened.
020515 They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.
020516 Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.
020517 They began to beg him to depart from their region.
020518 As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.
020519 He didn't allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you."
020520 He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.
020521 When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.
020522 Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
020523 and begged him much, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live."
020524 He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.
020525 A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,
020526 and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,
020527 having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.
020528 For she said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well."
020529 Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
020530 Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"
020531 His disciples said to him, "You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"
020532 He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
020533 But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
020534 He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease."
020535 While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler's house saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?"
020536 But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don't be afraid, only believe."
020537 He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.
020538 He came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.
020539 When he had entered in, he said to them, "Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep."
020540 They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
020541 Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha cumi!" which means, being interpreted, "Girl, I tell you, get up!"
020542 Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.
020543 He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.
020601 He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.
020602 When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?
020603 Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" They were offended at him.
020604 Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."
020605 He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them.
020606 He marveled because of their unbelief. He went around the villages teaching.
020607 He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
020608 He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,
020609 but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.
020610 He said to them, "Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.
020611 Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"
020612 They went out and preached that people should repent.
020613 They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them.
020614 King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him."
020615 But others said, "He is Elijah." Others said, "He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets."
020616 But Herod, when he heard this, said, "This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead."
020617 For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.
020618 For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
020619 Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn't,
020620 for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.
020621 Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.
020622 When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you."
020623 He swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."
020624 She went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" She said, "The head of John the Baptizer."
020625 She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter."
020626 The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn't wish to refuse her.
020627 Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John's head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
020628 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.
020629 When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
020630 The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.
020631 He said to them, "You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile." For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
020632 They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.
020633 They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.
020634 Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.
020635 When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, "This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.
020636 Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat."
020637 But he answered them, "You give them something to eat." They asked him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?"
020638 He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go see." When they knew, they said, "Five, and two fish."
020639 He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.
020640 They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.
020641 He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.
020642 They all ate, and were filled.
020643 They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.
020644 Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
020645 Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.
020646 After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.
020647 When evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.
020648 Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,
020649 but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
020650 for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, "Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid."
020651 He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;
020652 for they hadn't understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
020653 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.
020654 When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,
020655 and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.
020656 Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.
020701 Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.
020702 Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.
020703 (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.
020704 They don't eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)
020705 The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?"
020706 He answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
020707 But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'
020708 "For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things."
020709 He said to them, "Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.
020710 For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother;' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'
020711 But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;"'
020712 then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,
020713 making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this."
020714 He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.
020715 There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.
020716 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"
020717 When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.
020718 He said to them, "Are you thus without understanding also? Don't you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can't defile him,
020719 because it doesn't go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?"
020720 He said, "That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.
020721 For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,
020722 covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.
020723 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
020724 From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn't want anyone to know it, but he couldn't escape notice.
020725 For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.
020726 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.
020727 But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
020728 But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
020729 He said to her, "For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter."
020730 She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.
020731 Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of Decapolis.
020732 They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.
020733 He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.
020734 Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!"
020735 Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.
020736 He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.
020737 They were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"
020801 In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to them,
020802 "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.
020803 If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way."
020804 His disciples answered him, "From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?"
020805 He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven."
020806 He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.
020807 They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.
020808 They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.
020809 Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.
020810 Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.
020811 The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him.
020812 He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation."
020813 He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.
020814 They forgot to take bread; and they didn't have more than one loaf in the boat with them.
020815 He warned them, saying, "Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."
020816 They reasoned with one another, saying, "It's because we have no bread."
020817 Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, "Why do you reason that it's because you have no bread? Don't you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?
020818 Having eyes, don't you see? Having ears, don't you hear? Don't you remember?
020819 When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?" They told him, "Twelve."
020820 "When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?" They told him, "Seven."
020821 He asked them, "Don't you understand, yet?"
020822 He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.
020823 He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.
020824 He looked up, and said, "I see men; for I see them like trees walking."
020825 Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.
020826 He sent him away to his house, saying, "Don't enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village."
020827 Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, "Who do men say that I am?"
020828 They told him, "John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets."
020829 He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ."
020830 He commanded them that they should tell no one about him.
020831 He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
020832 He spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
020833 But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men."
020834 He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, "Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
020835 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.
020836 For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?
020837 For what will a man give in exchange for his life?
020838 For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
020901 He said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power."
020902 After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.
020903 His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
020904 Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.
020905 Peter answered Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let's make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
020906 For he didn't know what to say, for they were very afraid.
020907 A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."
020908 Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.
020909 As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
020910 They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the "rising from the dead" meant.
020911 They asked him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
020912 He said to them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?
020913 But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him."
020914 Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.
020915 Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him.
020916 He asked the scribes, "What are you asking them?"
020917 One of the multitude answered, "Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;
020918 and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren't able."
020919 He answered him, "Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me."
020920 They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.
020921 He asked his father, "How long has it been since this has come to him?" He said, "From childhood.
020922 Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us."
020923 Jesus said to him, "If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes."
020924 Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, "I believe. Help my unbelief!"
020925 When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, "You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!"
020926 Having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, "He is dead."
020927 But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.
020928 When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
020929 He said to them, "This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting."
020930 They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He didn't want anyone to know it.
020931 For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, "The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again."
020932 But they didn't understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
020933 He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, "What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?"
020934 But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest.
020935 He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, "If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all."
020936 He took a little child, and set him in the midst of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,
020937 "Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn't receive me, but him who sent me."
020938 John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone who doesn't follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn't follow us."
020939 But Jesus said, "Don't forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.
020940 For whoever is not against us is on our side.
020941 For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christ's, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.
020942 Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he was thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.
020943 If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire,
020944 'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'
020945 If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that will never be quenched--
020946 'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'
020947 If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire,
020948 'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'
020949 For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.
020950 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."
021001 He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.
021002 Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
021003 He answered, "What did Moses command you?"
021004 They said, "Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her."
021005 But Jesus said to them, "For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.
021006 But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.
021007 For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,
021008 and the two will become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.
021009 What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
021010 In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter.
021011 He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.
021012 If a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery."
021013 They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.
021014 But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them, "Allow the little children to come to me! Don't forbid them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
021015 Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it."
021016 He took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them.
021017 As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
021018 Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except one--God.
021019 You know the commandments: 'Do not murder,' 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false testimony,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and mother.'"
021020 He said to him, "Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth."
021021 Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, "One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross."
021022 But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.
021023 Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!"
021024 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, "Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!
021025 It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."
021026 They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, "Then who can be saved?"
021027 Jesus, looking at them, said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God."
021028 Peter began to tell him, "Behold, we have left all, and have followed you."
021029 Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,
021030 but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.
021031 But many who are first will be last; and the last first."
021032 They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.
021033 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.
021034 They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again."
021035 James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask."
021036 He said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
021037 They said to him, "Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory."
021038 But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
021039 They said to him, "We are able." Jesus said to them, "You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;
021040 but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared."
021041 When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards James and John.
021042 Jesus summoned them, and said to them, "You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
021043 But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.
021044 Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all.
021045 For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
021046 They came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.
021047 When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, "Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"
021048 Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, "You son of David, have mercy on me!"
021049 Jesus stood still, and said, "Call him." They called the blind man, saying to him, "Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!"
021050 He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
021051 Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said to him, "Rabboni, that I may see again."
021052 Jesus said to him, "Go your way. Your faith has made you well." Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
021101 When they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
021102 and said to them, "Go your way into the village that is opposite you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him.
021103 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs him;' and immediately he will send him back here."
021104 They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him.
021105 Some of those who stood there asked them, "What are you doing, untying the young donkey?"
021106 They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.
021107 They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it.
021108 Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and spreading them on the road.
021109 Those who went in front, and those who followed, cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
021110 Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
021111 Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
021112 The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry.
021113 Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
021114 Jesus told it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!" and his disciples heard it.
021115 They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.
021116 He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple.
021117 He taught, saying to them, "Isn't it written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?' But you have made it a den of robbers!"
021118 The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
021119 When evening came, he went out of the city.
021120 As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.
021121 Peter, remembering, said to him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away."
021122 Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.
021123 For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and doesn't doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says.
021124 Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.
021125 Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions.
021126 But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions."
021127 They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him,
021128 and they began saying to him, "By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?"
021129 Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
021130 The baptism of John--was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me."
021131 They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we should say, 'From heaven;' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
021132 If we should say, 'From men'"--they feared the people, for all held John to really be a prophet.
021133 They answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
021201 He began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country.
021202 When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard.
021203 They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.
021204 Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.
021205 Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.
021206 Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
021207 But those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
021208 They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
021209 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.
021210 Haven't you even read this Scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner.
021211 This was from the Lord, it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
021212 They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away.
021213 They sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.
021214 When they had come, they asked him, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don't defer to anyone; for you aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
021215 Shall we give, or shall we not give?" But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it."
021216 They brought it. He said to them, "Whose is this image and inscription?" They said to him, "Caesar's."
021217 Jesus answered them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." They marveled greatly at him.
021218 There came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,
021219 "Teacher, Moses wrote to us, 'If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.'
021220 There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.
021221 The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;
021222 and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.
021223 In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife."
021224 Jesus answered them, "Isn't this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?
021225 For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
021226 But about the dead, that they are raised; haven't you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
021227 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken."
021228 One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is the greatest of all?"
021229 Jesus answered, "The greatest is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one:
021230 you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment.
021231 The second is like this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."
021232 The scribe said to him, "Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he,
021233 and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
021234 When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God." No one dared ask him any question after that.
021235 Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, "How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
021236 For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'
021237 Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?" The common people heard him gladly.
021238 In his teaching he said to them, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,
021239 and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts:
021240 those who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."
021241 Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.
021242 A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin.
021243 He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,
021244 for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on."
021301 As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!"
021302 Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down."
021303 As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,
021304 "Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?"
021305 Jesus, answering, began to tell them, "Be careful that no one leads you astray.
021306 For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and will lead many astray.
021307 "When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.
021308 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains.
021309 But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.
021310 The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.
021311 When they lead you away and deliver you up, don't be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
021312 "Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
021313 You will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
021314 But when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,
021315 and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.
021316 Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.
021317 But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!
021318 Pray that your flight won't be in the winter.
021319 For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.
021320 Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.
021321 Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there!' don't believe it.
021322 For there will arise false christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.
021323 But you watch. "Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.
021324 But in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,
021325 the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
021326 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
021327 Then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky.
021328 "Now from the fig tree, learn this parable. When the branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near;
021329 even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.
021330 Most certainly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.
021331 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
021332 But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
021333 Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you don't know when the time is.
021334 "It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch.
021335 Watch therefore, for you don't know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;
021336 lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping.
021337 What I tell you, I tell all: Watch."
021401 It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him.
021402 For they said, "Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people."
021403 While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard--very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.
021404 But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, "Why has this ointment been wasted?
021405 For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." They grumbled against her.
021406 But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.
021407 For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.
021408 She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.
021409 Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her."
021410 Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.
021411 They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.
021412 On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover?"
021413 He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,
021414 and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'
021415 He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make ready for us there."
021416 His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.
021417 When it was evening he came with the twelve.
021418 As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me--he who eats with me."
021419 They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, "Surely not I?" And another said, "Surely not I?"
021420 He answered them, "It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.
021421 For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
021422 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body."
021423 He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.
021424 He said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.
021425 Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God."
021426 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
021427 Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
021428 However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
021429 But Peter said to him, "Although all will be offended, yet I will not."
021430 Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
021431 But he spoke all the more, "If I must die with you, I will not deny you." They all said the same thing.
021432 They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray."
021433 He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.
021434 He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch."
021435 He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.
021436 He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire."
021437 He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn't you watch one hour?
021438 Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
021439 Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.
021440 Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn't know what to answer him.
021441 He came the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
021442 Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."
021443 Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
021444 Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whoever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely."
021445 When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, "Rabbi! Rabbi!" and kissed him.
021446 They laid their hands on him, and seized him.
021447 But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
021448 Jesus answered them, "Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?
021449 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."
021450 They all left him, and fled.
021451 A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,
021452 but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
021453 They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him.
021454 Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.
021455 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.
021456 For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn't agree with each other.
021457 Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,
021458 "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.'"
021459 Even so, their testimony did not agree.
021460 The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?"
021461 But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
021462 Jesus said, "I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky."
021463 The high priest tore his clothes, and said, "What further need have we of witnesses?
021464 You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?" They all condemned him to be worthy of death.
021465 Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!" The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.
021466 As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,
021467 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!"
021468 But he denied it, saying, "I neither know, nor understand what you are saying." He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.
021469 The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, "This is one of them."
021470 But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, "You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it."
021471 But he began to curse, and to swear, "I don't know this man of whom you speak!"
021472 The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." When he thought about that, he wept.
021501 Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
021502 Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered, "So you say."
021503 The chief priests accused him of many things.
021504 Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!"
021505 But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
021506 Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
021507 There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
021508 The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
021509 Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
021510 For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
021511 But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.
021512 Pilate again asked them, "What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"
021513 They cried out again, "Crucify him!"
021514 Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!"
021515 Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.
021516 The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.
021517 They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
021518 They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
021519 They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.
021520 When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.
021521 They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.
021522 They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place of a skull."
021523 They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn't take it.
021524 Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.
021525 It was the third hour, and they crucified him.
021526 The superscription of his accusation was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."
021527 With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
021528 The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was numbered with transgressors."
021529 Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,
021530 save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
021531 Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He can't save himself.
021532 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him." Those who were crucified with him insulted him.
021533 When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
021534 At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
021535 Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah."
021536 One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down."
021537 Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.
021538 The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
021539 When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
021540 There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
021541 who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
021542 When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
021543 Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.
021544 Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.
021545 When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
021546 He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
021547 Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
021601 When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
021602 Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.
021603 They were saying among themselves, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"
021604 for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
021605 Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.
021606 He said to them, "Don't be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!
021607 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.'"
021608 They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.
021609 Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
021610 She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
021611 When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.
021612 After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.
021613 They went away and told it to the rest. They didn't believe them, either.
021614 Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn't believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
021615 He said to them, "Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation.
021616 He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.
021617 These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;
021618 they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."
021619 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
021620 They went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.
030101 Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
030102 even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,
030103 it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;
030104 that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
030105 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
030106 They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
030107 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.
030108 Now it happened, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his division,
030109 according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
030110 The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.
030111 An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
030112 Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
030113 But the angel said to him, "Don't be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
030114 You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.
030115 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.
030116 He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.
030117 He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
030118 Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."
030119 The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.
030120 Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn't believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
030121 The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.
030122 When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.
030123 It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.
030124 After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,
030125 "Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men."
030126 Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
030127 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
030128 Having come in, the angel said to her, "Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!"
030129 But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
030130 The angel said to her, "Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
030131 Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name 'Jesus.'
030132 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,
030133 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom."
030134 Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?"
030135 The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God.
030136 Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
030137 For everything spoken by God is possible."
030138 Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word." The angel departed from her.
030139 Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,
030140 and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
030141 It happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
030142 She called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
030143 Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
030144 For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
030145 Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!"
030146 Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord.
030147 My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
030148 for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
030149 For he who is mighty has done great things for me. Holy is his name.
030150 His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him.
030151 He has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
030152 He has put down princes from their thrones. And has exalted the lowly.
030153 He has filled the hungry with good things. He has sent the rich away empty.
030154 He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,
030155 As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his seed forever."
030156 Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house.
030157 Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son.
030158 Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her.
030159 It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.
030160 His mother answered, "Not so; but he will be called John."
030161 They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."
030162 They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
030163 He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John." They all marveled.
030164 His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.
030165 Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.
030166 All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, "What then will this child be?" The hand of the Lord was with him.
030167 His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
030168 "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited and worked redemption for his people;
030169 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
030170 (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),
030171 salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
030172 to show mercy towards our fathers, to remember his holy covenant,
030173 the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father,
030174 to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, should serve him without fear,
030175 In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.
030176 And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways,
030177 to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,
030178 because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,
030179 to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace."
030180 The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
030201 Now it happened in those days, that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.
030202 This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
030203 All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.
030204 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;
030205 to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.
030206 It happened, while they were there, that the day had come that she should give birth.
030207 She brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.
030208 There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
030209 Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
030210 The angel said to them, "Don't be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.
030211 For there is born to you, this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
030212 This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough."
030213 Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
030214 "Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward men."
030215 It happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to another, "Let's go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."
030216 They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
030217 When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
030218 All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.
030219 But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
030220 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.
030221 When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
030222 When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord
030223 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord"),
030224 and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, "A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
030225 Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
030226 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
030227 He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,
030228 then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
030229 "Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to your word, in peace;
030230 for my eyes have seen your salvation,
030231 which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
030232 a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel."
030233 Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,
030234 and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, "Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.
030235 Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
030236 There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
030237 and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn't depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day.
030238 Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.
030239 When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.
030240 The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
030241 His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.
030242 When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,
030243 and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn't know it,
030244 but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.
030245 When they didn't find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.
030246 It happened after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.
030247 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
030248 When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you."
030249 He said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?"
030250 They didn't understand the saying which he spoke to them.
030251 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
030252 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
030301 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
030302 in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.
030303 He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.
030304 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.
030305 Every valley will be filled. Every mountain and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become straight, and the rough ways smooth.
030306 All flesh will see God's salvation.'"
030307 He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
030308 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and don't begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father;' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!
030309 Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire."
030310 The multitudes asked him, "What then must we do?"
030311 He answered them, "He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise."
030312 Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what must we do?"
030313 He said to them, "Collect no more than that which is appointed to you."
030314 Soldiers also asked him, saying, "What about us? What must we do?" He said to them, "Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages."
030315 As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,
030316 John answered them all, "I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,
030317 whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
030318 Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,
030319 but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,
030320 added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
030321 Now it happened, when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,
030322 and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying "You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased."
030323 Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,
030324 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
030325 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
030326 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,
030327 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
030328 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,
030329 the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
030330 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,
030331 the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
030332 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
030333 the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
030334 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
030335 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
030336 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
030337 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,
030338 the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
030401 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
030402 for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.
030403 The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."
030404 Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.'"
030405 The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
030406 The devil said to him, "I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.
030407 If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours."
030408 Jesus answered him, "Get behind me Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.'"
030409 He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here,
030410 for it is written, 'He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;'
030411 and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.'"
030412 Jesus answering, said to him, "It has been said, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"
030413 When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time.
030414 Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area.
030415 He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
030416 He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.
030417 The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
030418 "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed,
030419 and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."
030420 He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.
030421 He began to tell them, "Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."
030422 All testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, "Isn't this Joseph's son?"
030423 He said to them, "Doubtless you will tell me this parable, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.'"
030424 He said, "Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.
030425 But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.
030426 Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.
030427 There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian."
030428 They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things.
030429 They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff.
030430 But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.
030431 He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,
030432 and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.
030433 In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
030434 saying, "Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!"
030435 Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!" When the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm.
030436 Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, "What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!"
030437 News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
030438 He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her.
030439 He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.
030440 When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
030441 Demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" Rebuking them, he didn't allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
030442 When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn't go away from them.
030443 But he said to them, "I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent."
030444 He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
030501 Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
030502 He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
030503 He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.
030504 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch."
030505 Simon answered him, "Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net."
030506 When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.
030507 They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.
030508 But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord."
030509 For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;
030510 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive."
030511 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.
030512 It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."
030513 He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean." Immediately the leprosy left him.
030514 He commanded him to tell no one, "But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
030515 But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
030516 But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.
030517 It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.
030518 Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.
030519 Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus.
030520 Seeing their faith, he said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."
030521 The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
030522 But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?
030523 Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?'
030524 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" (he said to the paralyzed man), "I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house."
030525 Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.
030526 Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."
030527 After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, "Follow me!"
030528 He left everything, and rose up and followed him.
030529 Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.
030530 Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"
030531 Jesus answered them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
030532 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
030533 They said to him, "Why do John's disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"
030534 He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
030535 But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days."
030536 He also told a parable to them. "No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.
030537 No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.
030538 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.
030539 No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, 'The old is better.'"
030601 Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.
030602 But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?"
030603 Jesus, answering them, said, "Haven't you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;
030604 how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?"
030605 He said to them, "The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."
030606 It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.
030607 The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.
030608 But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Rise up, and stand in the middle." He arose and stood.
030609 Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?"
030610 He looked around at them all, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.
030611 But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.
030612 It happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.
030613 When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:
030614 Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;
030615 Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot;
030616 Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor.
030617 He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;
030618 as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.
030619 All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all.
030620 He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God.
030621 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
030622 Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake.
030623 Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.
030624 "But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.
030625 Woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
030626 Woe, when men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.
030627 "But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
030628 bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.
030629 To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don't withhold your coat also.
030630 Give to everyone who asks you, and don't ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.
030631 "As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.
030632 If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
030633 If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
030634 If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.
030635 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
030636 Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is also merciful.
030637 Don't judge, and you won't be judged. Don't condemn, and you won't be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free.
030638 "Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you."
030639 He spoke a parable to them. "Can the blind guide the blind? Won't they both fall into a pit?
030640 A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.
030641 Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?
030642 Or how can you tell your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,' when you yourself don't see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye.
030643 For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit.
030644 For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people don't gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.
030645 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.
030646 "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and don't do the things which I say?
030647 Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.
030648 He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.
030649 But he who hears, and doesn't do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great."
030701 After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
030702 A certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.
030703 When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.
030704 When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for you to do this for him,
030705 for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us."
030706 Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.
030707 Therefore I didn't even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.
030708 For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
030709 When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel."
030710 Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.
030711 It happened soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.
030712 Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.
030713 When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, "Don't cry."
030714 He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I tell you, arise!"
030715 He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
030716 Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us!" and, "God has visited his people!"
030717 This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.
030718 The disciples of John told him about all these things.
030719 John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?"
030720 When the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?'"
030721 In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.
030722 Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
030723 Blessed is he who is not offended by me."
030724 When John's messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
030725 But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.
030726 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.
030727 This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
030728 "For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he."
030729 When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John's baptism.
030730 But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.
030731 "To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?
030732 They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, 'We piped to you, and you didn't dance. We mourned, and you didn't weep.'
030733 For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
030734 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
030735 Wisdom is justified by all her children."
030736 One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat at the table.
030737 Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.
030738 Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
030739 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner."
030740 Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." He said, "Teacher, say on."
030741 "A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
030742 When they couldn't pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?"
030743 Simon answered, "He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most." He said to him, "You have judged correctly."
030744 Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.
030745 You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.
030746 You didn't anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
030747 Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."
030748 He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
030749 Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"
030750 He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."
030801 It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,
030802 and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;
030803 and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod's steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions.
030804 When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.
030805 "The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.
030806 Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
030807 Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.
030808 Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times." As he said these things, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
030809 Then his disciples asked him, "What does this parable mean?"
030810 He said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'
030811 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
030812 Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.
030813 Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.
030814 That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.
030815 That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.
030816 "No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.
030817 For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.
030818 Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has."
030819 His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.
030820 It was told him by some saying, "Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you."
030821 But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it."
030822 Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they launched out.
030823 But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.
030824 They came to him, and awoke him, saying, "Master, master, we are dying!" He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.
030825 He said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, "Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"
030826 They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
030827 When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn't live in a house, but in the tombs.
030828 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torment me!"
030829 For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.
030830 Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.
030831 They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.
030832 Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.
030833 The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.
030834 When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
030835 People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
030836 Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.
030837 All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.
030838 But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
030839 "Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you." He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
030840 It happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
030841 Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus' feet, and begged him to come into his house,
030842 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.
030843 A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,
030844 came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.
030845 Jesus said, "Who touched me?" When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"
030846 But Jesus said, "Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me."
030847 When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
030848 He said to her, "Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace."
030849 While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue's house came, saying to him, "Your daughter is dead. Don't trouble the Teacher."
030850 But Jesus hearing it, answered him, "Don't be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed."
030851 When he came to the house, he didn't allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.
030852 All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, "Don't weep. She isn't dead, but sleeping."
030853 They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.
030854 But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, "Child, arise!"
030855 Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.
030856 Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.
030901 He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
030902 He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
030903 He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey--neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.
030904 Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.
030905 As many as don't receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
030906 They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.
030907 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,
030908 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
030909 Herod said, "John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?" He sought to see him.
030910 The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done. He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.
030911 But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing.
030912 The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, "Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place."
030913 But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people."
030914 For they were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
030915 They did so, and made them all sit down.
030916 He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.
030917 They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.
030918 It happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"
030919 They answered, "'John the Baptizer,' but others say, 'Elijah,' and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again."
030920 He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."
030921 But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,
030922 saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up."
030923 He said to all, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
030924 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.
030925 For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?
030926 For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.
030927 But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God."
030928 It happened about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.
030929 As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
030930 Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,
030931 who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
030932 Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.
030933 It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let's make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what he said.
030934 While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.
030935 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!"
030936 When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
030937 It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him.
030938 Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
030939 Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.
030940 I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn't."
030941 Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."
030942 While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
030943 They were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
030944 "Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men."
030945 But they didn't understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
030946 There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.
030947 Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,
030948 and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great."
030949 John answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn't follow with us."
030950 Jesus said to him, "Don't forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us."
030951 It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,
030952 and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.
030953 They didn't receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.
030954 When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?"
030955 But he turned and rebuked them, "You don't know of what kind of spirit you are.
030956 For the Son of Man didn't come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." They went to another village.
030957 As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, "I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord."
030958 Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
030959 He said to another, "Follow me!" But he said, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."
030960 But Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God."
030961 Another also said, "I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house."
030962 But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God."
031001 Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place, where he was about to come.
031002 Then he said to them, "The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.
031003 Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.
031004 Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way.
031005 Into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'
031006 If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.
031007 Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Don't go from house to house.
031008 Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.
031009 Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, 'The Kingdom of God has come near to you.'
031010 But into whatever city you enter, and they don't receive you, go out into its streets and say,
031011 'Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.'
031012 I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
031013 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
031014 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
031015 You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.
031016 Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."
031017 The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!"
031018 He said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.
031019 Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you.
031020 Nevertheless, don't rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
031021 In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight."
031022 Turning to the disciples, he said, "All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him."
031023 Turning to the disciples, he said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,
031024 for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them."
031025 Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
031026 He said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"
031027 He answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."
031028 He said to him, "You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live."
031029 But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"
031030 Jesus answered, "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
031031 By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
031032 In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
031033 But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,
031034 came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
031035 On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'
031036 Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?"
031037 He said, "He who showed mercy on him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."
031038 It happened as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
031039 She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.
031040 But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, "Lord, don't you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me."
031041 Jesus answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,
031042 but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her."
031101 It happened, that when he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."
031102 He said to them, "When you pray, say, 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come. May your will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven.
031103 Give us day by day our daily bread.
031104 Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'"
031105 He said to them, "Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
031106 for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,'
031107 and he from within will answer and say, 'Don't bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give it to you'?
031108 I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.
031109 "I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.
031110 For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
031111 "Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won't give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?
031112 Or if he asks for an egg, he won't give him a scorpion, will he?
031113 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"
031114 He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.
031115 But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."
031116 Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.
031117 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.
031118 If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
031119 But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.
031120 But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.
031121 "When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.
031122 But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.
031123 "He that is not with me is against me. He who doesn't gather with me scatters.
031124 The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, 'I will turn back to my house from which I came out.'
031125 When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.
031126 Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first."
031127 It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!"
031128 But he said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it."
031129 When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, "This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.
031130 For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.
031131 The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
031132 The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.
031133 "No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.
031134 The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.
031135 Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn't darkness.
031136 If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light."
031137 Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table.
031138 When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.
031139 The Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
031140 You foolish ones, didn't he who made the outside make the inside also?
031141 But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.
031142 But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.
031143 Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.
031144 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don't know it."
031145 One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying this you insult us also."
031146 He said, "Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won't even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.
031147 Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
031148 So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.
031149 Therefore also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,
031150 that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
031151 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.' Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
031152 Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn't enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered."
031153 As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;
031154 lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.
031201 Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
031202 But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.
031203 Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.
031204 "I tell you, my friends, don't be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
031205 But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear him.
031206 "Aren't five sparrows sold for two assaria coins? Not one of them is forgotten by God.
031207 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore don't be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
031208 "I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God;
031209 but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.
031210 Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
031211 When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don't be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;
031212 for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say."
031213 One of the multitude said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
031214 But he said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?"
031215 He said to them, "Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a man's life doesn't consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses."
031216 He spoke a parable to them, saying, "The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly.
031217 He reasoned within himself, saying, 'What will I do, because I don't have room to store my crops?'
031218 He said, 'This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
031219 I will tell my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry."'
031220 "But God said to him, 'You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared--whose will they be?'
031221 So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."
031222 He said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, don't be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.
031223 Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
031224 Consider the ravens: they don't sow, they don't reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!
031225 Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?
031226 If then you aren't able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?
031227 Consider the lilies, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
031228 But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?
031229 Don't seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.
031230 For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.
031231 But seek God's Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.
031232 Don't be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.
031233 Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don't grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn't fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.
031234 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
031235 "Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning.
031236 Be like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.
031237 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.
031238 They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.
031239 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.
031240 Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don't expect him."
031241 Peter said to him, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?"
031242 The Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?
031243 Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.
031244 Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.
031245 But if that servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,
031246 then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn't expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn't know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.
031247 That servant, who knew his lord's will, and didn't prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,
031248 but he who didn't know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whoever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.
031249 "I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled.
031250 But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!
031251 Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.
031252 For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
031253 They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."
031254 He said to the multitudes also, "When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.
031255 When a south wind blows, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens.
031256 You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don't interpret this time?
031257 Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?
031258 For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
031259 I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny."
031301 Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
031302 Jesus answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things?
031303 I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.
031304 Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?
031305 I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way."
031306 He spoke this parable. "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.
031307 He said to the vine dresser, 'Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?'
031308 He answered, 'Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.
031309 If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.'"
031310 He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.
031311 Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up.
031312 When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity."
031313 He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.
031314 The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, "There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!"
031315 Therefore the Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water?
031316 Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?"
031317 As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
031318 He said, "What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?
031319 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches."
031320 Again he said, "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?
031321 It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."
031322 He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.
031323 One said to him, "Lord, are they few who are saved?" He said to them,
031324 "Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.
031325 When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!' then he will answer and tell you, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'
031326 Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'
031327 He will say, 'I tell you, I don't know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.'
031328 There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.
031329 They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.
031330 Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last."
031331 On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, "Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you."
031332 He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.
031333 Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can't be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.'
031334 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!
031335 Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
031401 It happened, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.
031402 Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him.
031403 Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
031404 But they were silent. He took him, and healed him, and let him go.
031405 He answered them, "Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, wouldn't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?"
031406 They couldn't answer him regarding these things.
031407 He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,
031408 "When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don't sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,
031409 and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, 'Make room for this person.' Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.
031410 But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.
031411 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
031412 He also said to the one who had invited him, "When you make a dinner or a supper, don't call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back.
031413 But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;
031414 and you will be blessed, because they don't have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous."
031415 When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, "Blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God!"
031416 But he said to him, "A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.
031417 He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'
031418 They all as one began to make excuses. "The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.'
031419 "Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.'
031420 "Another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I can't come.'
031421 "That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.'
031422 "The servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.'
031423 "The lord said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
031424 For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.'"
031425 Now great multitudes were going with him. He turned and said to them,
031426 "If anyone comes to me, and doesn't hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can't be my disciple.
031427 Whoever doesn't bear his own cross, and come after me, can't be my disciple.
031428 For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesn't first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?
031429 Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,
031430 saying, 'This man began to build, and wasn't able to finish.'
031431 Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
031432 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.
031433 So therefore whoever of you who doesn't renounce all that he has, he can't be my disciple.
031434 Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?
031435 It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
031501 Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him.
031502 The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, "This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them."
031503 He told them this parable.
031504 "Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?
031505 When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
031506 When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'
031507 I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.
031508 Or what woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn't light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?
031509 When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.'
031510 Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting."
031511 He said, "A certain man had two sons.
031512 The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of your property.' He divided his livelihood between them.
031513 Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living.
031514 When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.
031515 He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
031516 He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.
031517 But when he came to himself he said, 'How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare, and I'm dying with hunger!
031518 I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.
031519 I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants."'
031520 "He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
031521 The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
031522 "But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.
031523 Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;
031524 for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.' They began to celebrate.
031525 "Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
031526 He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.
031527 He said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.'
031528 But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.
031529 But he answered his father, 'Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.
031530 But when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.'
031531 "He said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
031532 But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.'"
031601 He also said to his disciples, "There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions.
031602 He called him, and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'
031603 "The manager said within himself, 'What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don't have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.
031604 I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.'
031605 Calling each one of his lord's debtors to him, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my lord?'
031606 He said, 'A hundred batos of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
031607 Then said he to another, 'How much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred cors of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'
031608 "His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.
031609 I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.
031610 He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.
031611 If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
031612 If you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?
031613 No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren't able to serve God and mammon."
031614 The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.
031615 He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
031616 The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.
031617 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.
031618 Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.
031619 "Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.
031620 A certain beggar, named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores,
031621 and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
031622 It happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried.
031623 In Hades, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom.
031624 He cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.'
031625 "But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in like manner, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish.
031626 Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over from there to us.'
031627 "He said, 'I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house;
031628 for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they won't also come into this place of torment.'
031629 "But Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'
031630 "He said, 'No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
031631 "He said to him, 'If they don't listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.'"
031701 He said to the disciples, "It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!
031702 It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
031703 Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.
031704 If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him."
031705 The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."
031706 The Lord said, "If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.
031707 But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down at the table,'
031708 and will not rather tell him, 'Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink'?
031709 Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.
031710 Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.'"
031711 It happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.
031712 As he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance.
031713 They lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
031714 When he saw them, he said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." It happened that as they went, they were cleansed.
031715 One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.
031716 He fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.
031717 Jesus answered, "Weren't the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?
031718 Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?"
031719 Then he said to him, "Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you."
031720 Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, "The Kingdom of God doesn't come with observation;
031721 neither will they say, 'Look, here!' or, 'Look, there!' for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you."
031722 He said to the disciples, "The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
031723 They will tell you, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Don't go away, nor follow after them,
031724 for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.
031725 But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
031726 As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.
031727 They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
031728 Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
031729 but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.
031730 It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
031731 In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.
031732 Remember Lot's wife!
031733 Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.
031734 I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.
031735 There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left."
031736 
031737 They, answering, asked him, "Where, Lord?" He said to them, "Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together."
031801 He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,
031802 saying, "There was a judge in a certain city who didn't fear God, and didn't respect man.
031803 A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'
031804 He wouldn't for a while, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,
031805 yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.'"
031806 The Lord said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
031807 Won't God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?
031808 I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"
031809 He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.
031810 "Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.
031811 The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: 'God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
031812 I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.'
031813 But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'
031814 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."
031815 They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
031816 Jesus summoned them, saying, "Allow the little children to come to me, and don't hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
031817 Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it."
031818 A certain ruler asked him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
031819 Jesus asked him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one--God.
031820 You know the commandments: 'Don't commit adultery,' 'Don't murder,' 'Don't steal,' 'Don't give false testimony,' 'Honor your father and your mother.'"
031821 He said, "I have observed all these things from my youth up."
031822 When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me."
031823 But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.
031824 Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!
031825 For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."
031826 Those who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"
031827 But he said, "The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
031828 Peter said, "Look, we have left everything, and followed you."
031829 He said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of God's sake,
031830 who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life."
031831 He took the twelve aside, and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed.
031832 For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.
031833 They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again."
031834 They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn't understand the things that were said.
031835 It happened, as he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.
031836 Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.
031837 They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
031838 He cried out, "Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"
031839 Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, "You son of David, have mercy on me!"
031840 Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,
031841 "What do you want me to do?" He said, "Lord, that I may see again."
031842 Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you."
031843 Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God.
031901 He entered and was passing through Jericho.
031902 There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.
031903 He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn't because of the crowd, because he was short.
031904 He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.
031905 When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house."
031906 He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully.
031907 When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, "He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner."
031908 Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much."
031909 Jesus said to him, "Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.
031910 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost."
031911 As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately.
031912 He said therefore, "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
031913 He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins, and told them, 'Conduct business until I come.'
031914 But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, 'We don't want this man to reign over us.'
031915 "It happened when he had come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.
031916 The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.'
031917 "He said to him, 'Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'
031918 "The second came, saying, 'Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.'
031919 "So he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.'
031920 Another came, saying, 'Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,
031921 for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn't lay down, and reap that which you didn't sow.'
031922 "He said to him, 'Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn't lay down, and reaping that which I didn't sow.
031923 Then why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?'
031924 He said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.'
031925 "They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!'
031926 'For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
031927 But bring those enemies of mine who didn't want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.'"
031928 Having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
031929 It happened, when he drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,
031930 saying, "Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring it.
031931 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say to him: 'The Lord needs it.'"
031932 Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them.
031933 As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
031934 They said, "The Lord needs it."
031935 They brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them.
031936 As he went, they spread their cloaks in the way.
031937 As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,
031938 saying, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!"
031939 Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"
031940 He answered them, "I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out."
031941 When he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it,
031942 saying, "If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are hidden from your eyes.
031943 For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,
031944 and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you didn't know the time of your visitation."
031945 He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,
031946 saying to them, "It is written, 'My house is a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of robbers'!"
031947 He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him.
031948 They couldn't find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said.
032001 It happened on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, that the priests and scribes came to him with the elders.
032002 They asked him, "Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?"
032003 He answered them, "I also will ask you one question. Tell me:
032004 the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?"
032005 They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why didn't you believe him?'
032006 But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet."
032007 They answered that they didn't know where it was from.
032008 Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
032009 He began to tell the people this parable. "A man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.
032010 At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.
032011 He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
032012 He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out.
032013 The lord of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.'
032014 "But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'
032015 They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
032016 He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others." When they heard it, they said, "May it never be!"
032017 But he looked at them, and said, "Then what is this that is written, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief cornerstone?'
032018 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust."
032019 The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people--for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.
032020 They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.
032021 They asked him, "Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.
032022 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
032023 But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, "Why do you test me?
032024 Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?" They answered, "Caesar's."
032025 He said to them, "Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
032026 They weren't able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent.
032027 Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.
032028 They asked him, "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.
032029 There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.
032030 The second took her as wife, and he died childless.
032031 The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.
032032 Afterward the woman also died.
032033 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife."
032034 Jesus said to them, "The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.
032035 But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
032036 For they can't die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.
032037 But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord 'The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'
032038 Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him."
032039 Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you speak well."
032040 They didn't dare to ask him any more questions.
032041 He said to them, "Why do they say that the Christ is David's son?
032042 David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
032043 until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'
032044 "David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?"
032045 In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,
032046 "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;
032047 who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation."
032101 He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury.
032102 He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins.
032103 He said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,
032104 for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on."
032105 As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,
032106 "As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down."
032107 They asked him, "Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?"
032108 He said, "Watch out that you don't get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is at hand.' Therefore don't follow them.
032109 When you hear of wars and disturbances, don't be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end won't come immediately."
032110 Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
032111 There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.
032112 But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name's sake.
032113 It will turn out as a testimony for you.
032114 Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,
032115 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.
032116 You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death.
032117 You will be hated by all men for my name's sake.
032118 And not a hair of your head will perish.
032119 "By your endurance you will win your lives.
032120 "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.
032121 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein.
032122 For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
032123 Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people.
032124 They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
032125 There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;
032126 men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
032127 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
032128 But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near."
032129 He told them a parable. "See the fig tree, and all the trees.
032130 When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.
032131 Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.
032132 Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.
032133 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.
032134 "So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly.
032135 For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.
032136 Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man."
032137 Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet.
032138 All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.
032201 Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.
032202 The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
032203 Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve.
032204 He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.
032205 They were glad, and agreed to give him money.
032206 He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.
032207 The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
032208 He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat."
032209 They said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare?"
032210 He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.
032211 Tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'
032212 He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there."
032213 They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
032214 When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.
032215 He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,
032216 for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God."
032217 He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, "Take this, and share it among yourselves,
032218 for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes."
032219 He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me."
032220 Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
032221 But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.
032222 The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"
032223 They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
032224 There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
032225 He said to them, "The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called 'benefactors.'
032226 But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.
032227 For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn't it he who sits at the table? But I am in the midst of you as one who serves.
032228 But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.
032229 I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,
032230 that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
032231 The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,
032232 but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn't fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers."
032233 He said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!"
032234 He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times."
032235 He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing."
032236 Then he said to them, "But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
032237 For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: 'He was counted with transgressors.' For that which concerns me has an end."
032238 They said, "Lord, behold, here are two swords." He said to them, "That is enough."
032239 He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.
032240 When he was at the place, he said to them, "Pray that you don't enter into temptation."
032241 He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and he knelt down and prayed,
032242 saying, "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
032243 An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
032244 Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.
032245 When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,
032246 and said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."
032247 While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.
032248 But Jesus said to him, "Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"
032249 When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
032250 A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
032251 But Jesus answered, "Let me at least do this"--and he touched his ear, and healed him.
032252 Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
032253 When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn't stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
032254 They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from a distance.
032255 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.
032256 A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, "This man also was with him."
032257 He denied Jesus, saying, "Woman, I don't know him."
032258 After a little while someone else saw him, and said, "You also are one of them!" But Peter answered, "Man, I am not!"
032259 After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, "Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!"
032260 But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what you are talking about!" Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
032261 The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord's word, how he said to him, "Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times."
032262 He went out, and wept bitterly.
032263 The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.
032264 Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?"
032265 They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
032266 As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,
032267 "If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell you, you won't believe,
032268 and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.
032269 From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."
032270 They all said, "Are you then the Son of God?" He said to them, "You say it, because I am."
032271 They said, "Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!"
032301 The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.
032302 They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king."
032303 Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered him, "So you say."
032304 Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."
032305 But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place."
032306 But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
032307 When he found out that he was in Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.
032308 Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.
032309 He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.
032310 The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
032311 Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.
032312 Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.
032313 Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
032314 and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.
032315 Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
032316 I will therefore chastise him and release him."
032317 Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
032318 But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!"--
032319 one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
032320 Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,
032321 but they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify him!"
032322 He said to them the third time, "Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him."
032323 But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.
032324 Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.
032325 He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.
032326 When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.
032327 A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.
032328 But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
032329 For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
032330 Then they will begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover us.'
032331 For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?"
032332 There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.
032333 When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
032334 Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing." Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.
032335 The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!"
032336 The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,
032337 and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
032338 An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
032339 One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!"
032340 But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Don't you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?
032341 And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."
032342 He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom."
032343 Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."
032344 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
032345 The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
032346 Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" Having said this, he breathed his last.
032347 When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man."
032348 All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.
032349 All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
032350 Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man
032351 (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God:
032352 this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.
032353 He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.
032354 It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.
032355 The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.
032356 They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
032401 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
032402 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
032403 They entered in, and didn't find the Lord Jesus' body.
032404 It happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.
032405 Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. They said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
032406 He isn't here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,
032407 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?"
032408 They remembered his words,
032409 returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
032410 Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.
032411 These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn't believe them.
032412 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
032413 Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.
032414 They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.
032415 It happened, while they talked and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them.
032416 But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
032417 He said to them, "What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?"
032418 One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things which have happened there in these days?"
032419 He said to them, "What things?" They said to him, "The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;
032420 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
032421 But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.
032422 Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;
032423 and when they didn't find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
032424 Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn't see him."
032425 He said to them, "Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
032426 Didn't the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?"
032427 Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
032428 They drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.
032429 They urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over." He went in to stay with them.
032430 It happened, that when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave to them.
032431 Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.
032432 They said one to another, "Weren't our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?"
032433 They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
032434 saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"
032435 They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
032436 As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, "Peace be to you."
032437 But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
032438 He said to them, "Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?
032439 See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones, as you see that I have."
032440 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
032441 While they still didn't believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
032442 They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
032443 He took them, and ate in front of them.
032444 He said to them, "This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled."
032445 Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.
032446 He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
032447 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
032448 You are witnesses of these things.
032449 Behold, I send forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high."
032450 He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
032451 It happened, while he blessed them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.
032452 They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
032453 and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
040101 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
040102 The same was in the beginning with God.
040103 All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made.
040104 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
040105 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't overcome it.
040106 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
040107 The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.
040108 He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.
040109 The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
040110 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn't recognize him.
040111 He came to his own, and those who were his own didn't receive him.
040112 But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who believe in his name:
040113 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
040114 The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
040115 John testified about him. He cried out, saying, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'"
040116 From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.
040117 For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.
040118 No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
040119 This is John's testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
040120 He declared, and didn't deny, but he declared, "I am not the Christ."
040121 They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the prophet?" He answered, "No."
040122 They said therefore to him, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
040123 He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said."
040124 The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.
040125 They asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"
040126 John answered them, "I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don't know.
040127 He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to loosen."
040128 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
040129 The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
040130 This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.'
040131 I didn't know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel."
040132 John testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.
040133 I didn't recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, 'On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'
040134 I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God."
040135 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,
040136 and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
040137 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
040138 Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What are you looking for?" They said to him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), "where are you staying?"
040139 He said to them, "Come, and see." They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
040140 One of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
040141 He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah!" (which is, being interpreted, Christ).
040142 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which is by interpretation, Peter).
040143 On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, "Follow me."
040144 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
040145 Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
040146 Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."
040147 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
040148 Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
040149 Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!"
040150 Jesus answered him, "Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these!"
040151 He said to him, "Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
040201 The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus' mother was there.
040202 Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.
040203 When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no wine."
040204 Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come."
040205 His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it."
040206 Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.
040207 Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water." They filled them up to the brim.
040208 He said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast." So they took it.
040209 When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn't know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,
040210 and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!"
040211 This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
040212 After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
040213 The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
040214 He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.
040215 He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables.
040216 To those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things out of here! Don't make my Father's house a marketplace!"
040217 His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will eat me up."
040218 The Jews therefore answered him, "What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?"
040219 Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
040220 The Jews therefore said, "Forty-six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?"
040221 But he spoke of the temple of his body.
040222 When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
040223 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.
040224 But Jesus didn't trust himself to them, because he knew everyone,
040225 and because he didn't need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
040301 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
040302 The same came to him by night, and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him."
040303 Jesus answered him, "Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can't see the Kingdom of God."
040304 Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"
040305 Jesus answered, "Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can't enter into the Kingdom of God!
040306 That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
040307 Don't marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born anew.'
040308 The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don't know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."
040309 Nicodemus answered him, "How can these things be?"
040310 Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and don't understand these things?
040311 Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don't receive our witness.
040312 If I told you earthly things and you don't believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
040313 No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.
040314 As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
040315 that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
040316 For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
040317 For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.
040318 He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn't believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.
040319 This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.
040320 For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn't come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.
040321 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God."
040322 After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized.
040323 John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized.
040324 For John was not yet thrown into prison.
040325 There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with some Jews about purification.
040326 They came to John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him."
040327 John answered, "A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.
040328 You yourselves testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent before him.'
040329 He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.
040330 He must increase, but I must decrease.
040331 He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the Earth belongs to the Earth, and speaks of the Earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.
040332 What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.
040333 He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.
040334 For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.
040335 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
040336 One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won't see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."
040401 Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
040402 (although Jesus himself didn't baptize, but his disciples),
040403 he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.
040404 He needed to pass through Samaria.
040405 So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.
040406 Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
040407 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."
040408 For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
040409 The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, "How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
040410 Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
040411 The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where then have you that living water?
040412 Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?"
040413 Jesus answered her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
040414 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."
040415 The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I don't get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw."
040416 Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."
040417 The woman answered, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You said well, 'I have no husband,'
040418 for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly."
040419 The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
040420 Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."
040421 Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.
040422 You worship that which you don't know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
040423 But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers.
040424 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."
040425 The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah comes," (he who is called Christ). "When he has come, he will declare to us all things."
040426 Jesus said to her, "I am he, the one who speaks to you."
040427 At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, "What are you looking for?" or, "Why do you speak with her?"
040428 So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,
040429 "Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?"
040430 They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
040431 In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
040432 But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you don't know about."
040433 The disciples therefore said one to another, "Has anyone brought him something to eat?"
040434 Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.
040435 Don't you say, 'There are yet four months until the harvest?' Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.
040436 He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
040437 For in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'
040438 I sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."
040439 From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, "He told me everything that I did."
040440 So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.
040441 Many more believed because of his word.
040442 They said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world."
040443 After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.
040444 For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
040445 So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.
040446 Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
040447 When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
040448 Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe."
040449 The nobleman said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
040450 Jesus said to him, "Go your way. Your son lives." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.
040451 As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying "Your child lives!"
040452 So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him."
040453 So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives." He believed, as did his whole house.
040454 This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.
040501 After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
040502 Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches.
040503 In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;
040504 for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.
040505 A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.
040506 When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to be made well?"
040507 The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another steps down before me."
040508 Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."
040509 Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
040510 So the Jews said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat."
040511 He answered them, "He who made me well, the same said to me, 'Take up your mat, and walk.'"
040512 Then they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Take up your mat, and walk'?"
040513 But he who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.
040514 Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you."
040515 The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
040516 For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.
040517 But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working, so I am working, too."
040518 For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
040519 Jesus therefore answered them, "Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.
040520 For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.
040521 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.
040522 For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,
040523 that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him.
040524 "Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn't come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
040525 Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God's voice; and those who hear will live.
040526 For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.
040527 He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.
040528 Don't marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,
040529 and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
040530 I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.
040531 "If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.
040532 It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.
040533 You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
040534 But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.
040535 He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
040536 But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.
040537 The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
040538 You don't have his word living in you; because you don't believe him whom he sent.
040539 "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.
040540 Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.
040541 I don't receive glory from men.
040542 But I know you, that you don't have God's love in yourselves.
040543 I have come in my Father's name, and you don't receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
040544 How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God?
040545 "Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.
040546 For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.
040547 But if you don't believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"
040601 After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.
040602 A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick.
040603 Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.
040604 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
040605 Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, "Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?"
040606 This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
040607 Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little."
040608 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,
040609 "There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?"
040610 Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
040611 Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.
040612 When they were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost."
040613 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.
040614 When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, "This is truly the prophet who comes into the world."
040615 Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
040616 When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
040617 and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
040618 The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.
040619 When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.
040620 But he said to them, "It is I. Don't be afraid."
040621 They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
040622 On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn't entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.
040623 However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
040624 When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
040625 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
040626 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.
040627 Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him."
040628 They said therefore to him, "What must we do, that we may work the works of God?"
040629 Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."
040630 They said therefore to him, "What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?
040631 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, 'He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.'"
040632 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
040633 For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."
040634 They said therefore to him, "Lord, always give us this bread."
040635 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.
040636 But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don't believe.
040637 All those who the Father gives me will come to me. Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out.
040638 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
040639 This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.
040640 This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
040641 The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, "I am the bread which came down out of heaven."
040642 They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'"
040643 Therefore Jesus answered them, "Don't murmur among yourselves.
040644 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.
040645 It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.' Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.
040646 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.
040647 Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.
040648 I am the bread of life.
040649 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
040650 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.
040651 I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."
040652 The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
040653 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don't have life in yourselves.
040654 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
040655 For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
040656 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.
040657 As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.
040658 This is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever."
040659 He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
040660 Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?"
040661 But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?
040662 Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
040663 It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.
040664 But there are some of you who don't believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe, and who it was who would betray him.
040665 He said, "For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father."
040666 At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
040667 Jesus said therefore to the twelve, "You don't also want to go away, do you?"
040668 Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
040669 We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
040670 Jesus answered them, "Didn't I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
040671 Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.
040701 After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn't walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
040702 Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.
040703 His brothers therefore said to him, "Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.
040704 For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world."
040705 For even his brothers didn't believe in him.
040706 Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
040707 The world can't hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.
040708 You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled."
040709 Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.
040710 But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
040711 The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, "Where is he?"
040712 There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "Not so, but he leads the multitude astray."
040713 Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
040714 But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
040715 The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man know letters, having never been educated?"
040716 Jesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
040717 If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.
040718 He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
040719 Didn't Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?"
040720 The multitude answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?"
040721 Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
040722 Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.
040723 If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?
040724 Don't judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
040725 Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, "Isn't this he whom they seek to kill?
040726 Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?
040727 However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from."
040728 Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don't know.
040729 I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."
040730 They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
040731 But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, he won't do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?"
040732 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.
040733 Then Jesus said, "I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.
040734 You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come."
040735 The Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this man go that we won't find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
040736 What is this word that he said, 'You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come'?"
040737 Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
040738 He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water."
040739 But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn't yet glorified.
040740 Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, "This is truly the prophet."
040741 Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?
040742 Hasn't the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"
040743 So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
040744 Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.
040745 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why didn't you bring him?"
040746 The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"
040747 The Pharisees therefore answered them, "You aren't also led astray, are you?
040748 Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?
040749 But this multitude that doesn't know the law is accursed."
040750 Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,
040751 "Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?"
040752 They answered him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."
040753 Everyone went to his own house,
040801 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
040802 Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down, and taught them.
040803 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the midst,
040804 they told him, "Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.
040805 Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such. What then do you say about her?"
040806 They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
040807 But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her."
040808 Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
040809 They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.
040810 Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, "Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?"
040811 She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more."
040812 Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life."
040813 The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid."
040814 Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don't know where I came from, or where I am going.
040815 You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.
040816 Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.
040817 It's also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.
040818 I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me."
040819 They said therefore to him, "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither me, nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."
040820 Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.
040821 Jesus said therefore again to them, "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you can't come."
040822 The Jews therefore said, "Will he kill himself, that he says, 'Where I am going, you can't come?'"
040823 He said to them, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.
040824 I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins."
040825 They said therefore to him, "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.
040826 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world."
040827 They didn't understand that he spoke to them about the Father.
040828 Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things.
040829 He who sent me is with me. The Father hasn't left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him."
040830 As he spoke these things, many believed in him.
040831 Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.
040832 You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
040833 They answered him, "We are Abraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, 'You will be made free?'"
040834 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.
040835 A bondservant doesn't live in the house forever. A son remains forever.
040836 If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
040837 I know that you are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.
040838 I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father."
040839 They answered him, "Our father is Abraham." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.
040840 But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn't do this.
040841 You do the works of your father." They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God."
040842 Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven't come of myself, but he sent me.
040843 Why don't you understand my speech? Because you can't hear my word.
040844 You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its father.
040845 But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.
040846 Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?
040847 He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don't hear, because you are not of God."
040848 Then the Jews answered him, "Don't we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?"
040849 Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
040850 But I don't seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.
040851 Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death."
040852 Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.'
040853 Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?"
040854 Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.
040855 You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, 'I don't know him,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.
040856 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad."
040857 The Jews therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"
040858 Jesus said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM."
040859 Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the midst of them, and so passed by.
040901 As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
040902 His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
040903 Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.
040904 I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
040905 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
040906 When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud,
040907 and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.
040908 The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, "Isn't this he who sat and begged?"
040909 Others were saying, "It is he." Still others were saying, "He looks like him." He said, "I am he."
040910 They therefore were asking him, "How were your eyes opened?"
040911 He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight."
040912 Then they asked him, "Where is he?" He said, "I don't know."
040913 They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.
040914 It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
040915 Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."
040916 Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them.
040917 Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."
040918 The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
040919 and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
040920 His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
040921 but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself."
040922 His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
040923 Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."
040924 So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."
040925 He therefore answered, "I don't know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see."
040926 They said to him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"
040927 He answered them, "I told you already, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't also want to become his disciples, do you?"
040928 They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
040929 We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don't know where he comes from."
040930 The man answered them, "How amazing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
040931 We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.
040932 Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
040933 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
040934 They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" They threw him out.
040935 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"
040936 He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"
040937 Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you."
040938 He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshiped him.
040939 Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind."
040940 Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, "Are we also blind?"
040941 Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains.
041001 "Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn't enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
041002 But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
041003 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
041004 Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
041005 They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don't know the voice of strangers."
041006 Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn't understand what he was telling them.
041007 Jesus therefore said to them again, "Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep's door.
041008 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them.
041009 I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.
041010 The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
041011 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
041012 He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.
041013 The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the sheep.
041014 I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I'm known by my own;
041015 even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.
041016 I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.
041017 Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
041018 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father."
041019 Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words.
041020 Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?"
041021 Others said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn't possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?"
041022 It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.
041023 It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch.
041024 The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, "How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."
041025 Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you don't believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me.
041026 But you don't believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.
041027 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
041028 I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
041029 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand.
041030 I and the Father are one."
041031 Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him.
041032 Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?"
041033 The Jews answered him, "We don't stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God."
041034 Jesus answered them, "Isn't it written in your law, 'I said, you are gods?'
041035 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken),
041036 do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God?'
041037 If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me.
041038 But if I do them, though you don't believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."
041039 They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.
041040 He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.
041041 Many came to him. They said, "John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is true."
041042 Many believed in him there.
041101 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.
041102 It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick.
041103 The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, "Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick."
041104 But when Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God's Son may be glorified by it."
041105 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
041106 When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was.
041107 Then after this he said to the disciples, "Let's go into Judea again."
041108 The disciples told him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"
041109 Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesn't stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
041110 But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isn't in him."
041111 He said these things, and after that, he said to them, "Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep."
041112 The disciples therefore said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
041113 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
041114 So Jesus said to them plainly then, "Lazarus is dead.
041115 I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let's go to him."
041116 Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let's go also, that we may die with him."
041117 So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.
041118 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.
041119 Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
041120 Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.
041121 Therefore Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died.
041122 Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you."
041123 Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
041124 Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
041125 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies.
041126 Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"
041127 She said to him, "Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God's Son, he who comes into the world."
041128 When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here, and is calling you."
041129 When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.
041130 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.
041131 Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."
041132 Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died."
041133 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
041134 and said, "Where have you laid him?" They told him, "Lord, come and see."
041135 Jesus wept.
041136 The Jews therefore said, "See how much affection he had for him!"
041137 Some of them said, "Couldn't this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?"
041138 Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
041139 Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."
041140 Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see God's glory?"
041141 So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, "Father, I thank you that you listened to me.
041142 I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me."
041143 When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
041144 He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Free him, and let him go."
041145 Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.
041146 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.
041147 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, "What are we doing? For this man does many signs.
041148 If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
041149 But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,
041150 nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."
041151 Now he didn't say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
041152 and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
041153 So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.
041154 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.
041155 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.
041156 Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, "What do you think--that he isn't coming to the feast at all?"
041157 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.
041201 Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
041202 So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.
041203 Mary, therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
041204 Then Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,
041205 "Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?"
041206 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.
041207 But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.
041208 For you always have the poor with you, but you don't always have me."
041209 A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
041210 But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,
041211 because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
041212 On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
041213 they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!"
041214 Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,
041215 "Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt."
041216 His disciples didn't understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.
041217 The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.
041218 For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.
041219 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him."
041220 Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.
041221 These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."
041222 Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.
041223 Jesus answered them, "The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
041224 Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.
041225 He who loves his life will lose it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.
041226 If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.
041227 "Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? 'Father, save me from this time?' But for this cause I came to this time.
041228 Father, glorify your name!" Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
041229 The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."
041230 Jesus answered, "This voice hasn't come for my sake, but for your sakes.
041231 Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out.
041232 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."
041233 But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die.
041234 The multitude answered him, "We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up?' Who is this Son of Man?"
041235 Jesus therefore said to them, "Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness doesn't overtake you. He who walks in the darkness doesn't know where he is going.
041236 While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light." Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.
041237 But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didn't believe in him,
041238 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, "Lord, who has believed our report? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
041239 For this cause they couldn't believe, for Isaiah said again,
041240 "He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and I would heal them."
041241 Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
041242 Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it, so that they wouldn't be put out of the synagogue,
041243 for they loved men's praise more than God's praise.
041244 Jesus cried out and said, "Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.
041245 He who sees me sees him who sent me.
041246 I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.
041247 If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn't believe, I don't judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
041248 He who rejects me, and doesn't receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day.
041249 For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
041250 I know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak."
041301 Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
041302 During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,
041303 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and was going to God,
041304 arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
041305 Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
041306 Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?"
041307 Jesus answered him, "You don't know what I am doing now, but you will understand later."
041308 Peter said to him, "You will never wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I don't wash you, you have no part with me."
041309 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"
041310 Jesus said to him, "Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you."
041311 For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, "You are not all clean."
041312 So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?
041313 You call me, 'Teacher' and 'Lord.' You say so correctly, for so I am.
041314 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
041315 For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.
041316 Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him.
041317 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
041318 I don't speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.'
041319 From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he.
041320 Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me."
041321 When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."
041322 The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke.
041323 One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus' breast.
041324 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, "Tell us who it is of whom he speaks."
041325 He, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast, asked him, "Lord, who is it?"
041326 Jesus therefore answered, "It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it." So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
041327 After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly."
041328 Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him.
041329 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, "Buy what things we need for the feast," or that he should give something to the poor.
041330 Therefore, having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.
041331 When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.
041332 If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.
041333 Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you can't come,' so now I tell you.
041334 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just like I have loved you; that you also love one another.
041335 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."
041336 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you can't follow now, but you will follow afterwards."
041337 Peter said to him, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."
041338 Jesus answered him, "Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won't crow until you have denied me three times.
041401 "Don't let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me.
041402 In my Father's house are many homes. If it weren't so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.
041403 If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.
041404 Where I go, you know, and you know the way."
041405 Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going. How can we know the way?"
041406 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.
041407 If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him."
041408 Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."
041409 Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, 'Show us the Father?'
041410 Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.
041411 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works' sake.
041412 Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.
041413 Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
041414 If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.
041415 If you love me, keep my commandments.
041416 I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, that he may be with you forever,--
041417 the Spirit of truth, whom the world can't receive; for it doesn't see him, neither knows him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.
041418 I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.
041419 Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.
041420 In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
041421 One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him."
041422 Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?"
041423 Jesus answered him, "If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.
041424 He who doesn't love me doesn't keep my words. The word which you hear isn't mine, but the Father's who sent me.
041425 I have said these things to you, while still living with you.
041426 But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.
041427 Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don't let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
041428 You heard how I told you, 'I go away, and I come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said 'I am going to my Father;' for the Father is greater than I.
041429 Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.
041430 I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.
041431 But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.
041501 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.
041502 Every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
041503 You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
041504 Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can't bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.
041505 I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
041506 If a man doesn't remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
041507 If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.
041508 "In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.
041509 Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.
041510 If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and remain in his love.
041511 I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.
041512 "This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.
041513 Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.
041514 You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.
041515 No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn't know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
041516 You didn't choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.
041517 "I command these things to you, that you may love one another.
041518 If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.
041519 If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
041520 Remember the word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than his lord.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
041521 But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they don't know him who sent me.
041522 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
041523 He who hates me, hates my Father also.
041524 If I hadn't done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn't have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father.
041525 But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.'
041526 "When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.
041527 You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
041601 "These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn't be caused to stumble.
041602 They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.
041603 They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.
041604 But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn't tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
041605 But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'
041606 But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.
041607 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don't go away, the Counselor won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.
041608 When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;
041609 about sin, because they don't believe in me;
041610 about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won't see me any more;
041611 about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
041612 "I have yet many things to tell you, but you can't bear them now.
041613 However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming.
041614 He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.
041615 All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine, and will declare it to you.
041616 A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me."
041617 Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, "What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;' and, 'Because I go to the Father?'"
041618 They said therefore, "What is this that he says, 'A little while?' We don't know what he is saying."
041619 Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, "Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?'
041620 Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
041621 A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn't remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.
041622 Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.
041623 "In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.
041624 Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.
041625 I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.
041626 In that day you will ask in my name; and I don't say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,
041627 for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.
041628 I came out from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."
041629 His disciples said to him, "Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.
041630 Now we know that you know all things, and don't need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came forth from God."
041631 Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?
041632 Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
041633 I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world."
041701 Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;
041702 even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.
041703 This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.
041704 I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.
041705 Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.
041706 I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.
041707 Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,
041708 for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me.
041709 I pray for them. I don't pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
041710 All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.
041711 I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
041712 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
041713 But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
041714 I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
041715 I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.
041716 They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
041717 Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.
041718 As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.
041719 For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
041720 Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,
041721 that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.
041722 The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;
041723 I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me.
041724 Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.
041725 Righteous Father, the world hasn't known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.
041726 I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them."
041801 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered.
041802 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples.
041803 Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
041804 Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went forth, and said to them, "Who are you looking for?"
041805 They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am he." Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
041806 When therefore he said to them, "I am he," they went backward, and fell to the ground.
041807 Again therefore he asked them, "Who are you looking for?" They said, "Jesus of Nazareth."
041808 Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,"
041809 that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, "Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none."
041810 Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
041811 Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?"
041812 So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,
041813 and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
041814 Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.
041815 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
041816 but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.
041817 Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, "Are you also one of this man's disciples?" He said, "I am not."
041818 Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.
041819 The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.
041820 Jesus answered him, "I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret.
041821 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said."
041822 When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, "Do you answer the high priest like that?"
041823 Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?"
041824 Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.
041825 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, "You aren't also one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, and said, "I am not."
041826 One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn't I see you in the garden with him?"
041827 Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
041828 They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
041829 Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?"
041830 They answered him, "If this man weren't an evildoer, we wouldn't have delivered him up to you."
041831 Pilate therefore said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law." Therefore the Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,"
041832 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.
041833 Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
041834 Jesus answered him, "Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?"
041835 Pilate answered, "I'm not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?"
041836 Jesus answered, "My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn't be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here."
041837 Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you a king then?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."
041838 Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, "I find no basis for a charge against him.
041839 But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
041840 Then they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.
041901 So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him.
041902 The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.
041903 They kept saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and they kept slapping him.
041904 Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him."
041905 Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, "Behold, the man!"
041906 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him."
041907 The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
041908 When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.
041909 He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.
041910 Pilate therefore said to him, "Aren't you speaking to me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?"
041911 Jesus answered, "You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin."
041912 At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you release this man, you aren't Caesar's friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!"
041913 When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called "The Pavement," but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha."
041914 Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"
041915 They cried out, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"
041916 So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.
041917 He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called "The Place of a Skull," which is called in Hebrew, "Golgotha,"
041918 where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.
041919 Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
041920 Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
041921 The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don't write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'he said, I am King of the Jews.'"
041922 Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
041923 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
041924 Then they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be," that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, "They parted my garments among them. For my cloak they cast lots." Therefore the soldiers did these things.
041925 But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
041926 Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son!"
041927 Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.
041928 After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."
041929 Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.
041930 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
041931 Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
041932 Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;
041933 but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs.
041934 However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
041935 He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.
041936 For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of him will not be broken."
041937 Again another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom they pierced."
041938 After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.
041939 Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.
041940 So they took Jesus' body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
041941 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.
041942 Then because of the Jews' Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.
042001 Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
042002 Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have laid him!"
042003 Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.
042004 They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.
042005 Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn't enter in.
042006 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,
042007 and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
042008 So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.
042009 For as yet they didn't know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
042010 So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
042011 But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,
042012 and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
042013 They told her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have laid him."
042014 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus.
042015 Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?" She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away."
042016 Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him, "Rabboni!" which is to say, "Teacher!"
042017 Jesus said to her, "Don't hold me, for I haven't yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
042018 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
042019 When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace be to you."
042020 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.
042021 Jesus therefore said to them again, "Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you."
042022 When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit!
042023 Whoever's sins you forgive, they are forgiven them. Whoever's sins you retain, they have been retained."
042024 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with them when Jesus came.
042025 The other disciples therefore said to him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
042026 After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace be to you."
042027 Then he said to Thomas, "Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don't be unbelieving, but believing."
042028 Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"
042029 Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed."
042030 Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;
042031 but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.
042101 After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.
042102 Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.
042103 Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing." They told him, "We are also coming with you." They immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.
042104 But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn't know that it was Jesus.
042105 Jesus therefore said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?" They answered him, "No."
042106 He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.
042107 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord!" So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.
042108 But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish.
042109 So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
042110 Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have just caught."
042111 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net wasn't torn.
042112 Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast." None of the disciples dared inquire of him, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Lord.
042113 Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
042114 This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
042115 So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
042116 He said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep."
042117 He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?" Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, "Do you have affection for me?" He said to him, "Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.
042118 Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you don't want to go."
042119 Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, "Follow me."
042120 Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, "Lord, who is going to betray You?"
042121 Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man?"
042122 Jesus said to him, "If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me."
042123 This saying therefore went out among the brothers, that this disciple wouldn't die. Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, but, "If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?"
042124 This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true.
042125 There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.
050101 The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
050102 until the day in which he was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
050103 To these he also showed himself alive after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about God's Kingdom.
050104 Being assembled together with them, he commanded them, "Don't depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me.
050105 For John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
050106 Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
050107 He said to them, "It isn't for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority.
050108 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth."
050109 When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.
050110 While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing,
050111 who also said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky."
050112 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
050113 When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
050114 All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
050115 In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,
050116 "Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.
050117 For he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry.
050118 Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed out.
050119 It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called 'Akeldama,' that is, 'The field of blood.'
050120 For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his habitation be made desolate. Let no one dwell therein;' and, 'Let another take his office.'
050121 "Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
050122 beginning from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection."
050123 They put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
050124 They prayed, and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen
050125 to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place."
050126 They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
050201 Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place.
050202 Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
050203 Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them.
050204 They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.
050205 Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky.
050206 When this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language.
050207 They were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, "Behold, aren't all these who speak Galileans?
050208 How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?
050209 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
050210 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
050211 Cretans and Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God!"
050212 They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, "What does this mean?"
050213 Others, mocking, said, "They are filled with new wine."
050214 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, "You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.
050215 For these aren't drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day.
050216 But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel:
050217 'It will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions. Your old men will dream dreams.
050218 Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days, I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
050219 I will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.
050220 The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.
050221 It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.'
050222 "Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,
050223 him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;
050224 whom God raised up, having freed him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
050225 For David says concerning him, 'I saw the Lord always before my face, For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
050226 Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;
050227 because you will not leave my soul in Hades, neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.
050228 You made known to me the ways of life. You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'
050229 "Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
050230 Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,
050231 he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul left in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.
050232 This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.
050233 Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.
050234 For David didn't ascend into the heavens, but he says himself, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit by my right hand,
050235 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'
050236 "Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."
050237 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
050238 Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
050239 For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself."
050240 With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"
050241 Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.
050242 They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer.
050243 Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.
050244 All who believed were together, and had all things in common.
050245 They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.
050246 Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
050247 praising God, and having favor with all the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.
050301 Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
050302 A certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple.
050303 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy.
050304 Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, "Look at us."
050305 He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.
050306 But Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!"
050307 He took him by the right hand, and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.
050308 Leaping up, he stood, and began to walk. He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.
050309 All the people saw him walking and praising God.
050310 They recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
050311 As the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
050312 When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?
050313 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.
050314 But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
050315 and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.
050316 By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
050317 "Now, brothers, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
050318 But the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.
050319 "Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord,
050320 and that he may send Christ Jesus, who was ordained for you before,
050321 whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets.
050322 For Moses indeed said to the fathers, 'The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you.
050323 It will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'
050324 Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.
050325 You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.'
050326 God, having raised up his servant, Jesus, sent him to you first, to bless you, in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness."
050401 As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,
050402 being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
050403 They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.
050404 But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
050405 It happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.
050406 Annas the high priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest.
050407 When they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"
050408 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
050409 if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,
050410 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole.
050411 He is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.'
050412 There is salvation in none other, for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved!"
050413 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus.
050414 Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
050415 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
050416 saying, "What shall we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can't deny it.
050417 But so that this spreads no further among the people, let's threaten them, that from now on they don't speak to anyone in this name."
050418 They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
050419 But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,
050420 for we can't help telling the things which we saw and heard."
050421 When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.
050422 For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
050423 Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
050424 When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, "O Lord, you are God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
050425 who by the mouth of your servant, David, said, 'Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
050426 The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take council together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.'
050427 "For truly, in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together
050428 to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen.
050429 Now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,
050430 while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus."
050431 When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
050432 The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.
050433 With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was on them all.
050434 For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,
050435 and laid them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need.
050436 Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,
050437 having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
050501 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold a possession,
050502 and kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
050503 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
050504 While you kept it, didn't it remain your own? After it was sold, wasn't it in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You haven't lied to men, but to God."
050505 Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things.
050506 The young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.
050507 About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.
050508 Peter answered her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much." She said, "Yes, for so much."
050509 But Peter asked her, "How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
050510 She fell down immediately at his feet, and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.
050511 Great fear came on the whole assembly, and on all who heard these things.
050512 By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.
050513 None of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them.
050514 More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.
050515 They even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them.
050516 Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed.
050517 But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,
050518 and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody.
050519 But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,
050520 "Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
050521 When they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
050522 But the officers who came didn't find them in the prison. They returned and reported,
050523 "We found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!"
050524 Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.
050525 One came and told them, "Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people."
050526 Then the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them.
050527 When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,
050528 saying, "Didn't we strictly command you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us."
050529 But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.
050530 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a tree.
050531 God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
050532 We are His witnesses of these things; and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
050533 But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and determined to kill them.
050534 But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while.
050535 He said to them, "You men of Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do.
050536 For before these days Theudas rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.
050537 After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him. He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.
050538 Now I tell you, withdraw from these men, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown.
050539 But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting against God!"
050540 They agreed with him. Summoning the apostles, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
050541 They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for Jesus' name.
050542 Every day, in the temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus, the Christ.
050601 Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.
050602 The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, "It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.
050603 Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
050604 But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."
050605 These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;
050606 whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
050607 The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
050608 Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.
050609 But some of those who were of the synagogue called "The Libertines," and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.
050610 They weren't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
050611 Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."
050612 They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the council,
050613 and set up false witnesses who said, "This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.
050614 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us."
050615 All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.
050701 The high priest said, "Are these things so?"
050702 He said, "Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
050703 and said to him, 'Get out of your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.'
050704 Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living.
050705 He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no child.
050706 God spoke in this way: that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
050707 'I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,' said God, 'and after that will they come out, and serve me in this place.'
050708 He gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.
050709 "The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him,
050710 and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
050711 Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.
050712 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.
050713 On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race was revealed to Pharaoh.
050714 Joseph sent, and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.
050715 Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, himself and our fathers,
050716 and they were brought back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem.
050717 "But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
050718 until there arose a different king, who didn't know Joseph.
050719 The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they wouldn't stay alive.
050720 At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father's house.
050721 When he was thrown out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son.
050722 Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and works.
050723 But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
050724 Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.
050725 He supposed that his brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance; but they didn't understand.
050726 "The day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, 'Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?'
050727 But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
050728 Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
050729 Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.
050730 "When forty years were fulfilled, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
050731 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,
050732 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' Moses trembled, and dared not look.
050733 The Lord said to him, 'Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.
050734 I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into Egypt.'
050735 "This Moses, whom they refused, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
050736 This man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
050737 This is that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, 'The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me.'
050738 This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received living oracles to give to us,
050739 to whom our fathers wouldn't be obedient, but rejected him, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,
050740 saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.'
050741 They made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
050742 But God turned, and gave them up to serve the army of the sky, as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'Did you offer to me slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
050743 You took up the tabernacle of Moloch, the star of your god Rephan, the figures which you made to worship. I will carry you away beyond Babylon.'
050744 "Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen;
050745 which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered into the possession of the nations, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David,
050746 who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.
050747 But Solomon built him a house.
050748 However, the Most High doesn't dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says,
050749 'heaven is my throne, and the earth a footstool for my feet. What kind of house will you build me?' says the Lord; 'or what is the place of my rest?
050750 Didn't my hand make all these things?'
050751 "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers did, so you do.
050752 Which of the prophets didn't your fathers persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.
050753 You received the law as it was ordained by angels, and didn't keep it!"
050754 Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth.
050755 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
050756 and said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!"
050757 But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at him with one accord.
050758 They threw him out of the city, and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
050759 They stoned Stephen as he called out, saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"
050760 He kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, don't hold this sin against them!" When he had said this, he fell asleep.
050801 Saul was consenting to his death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.
050802 Devout men buried Stephen, and lamented greatly over him.
050803 But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison.
050804 Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word.
050805 Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.
050806 The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did.
050807 For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.
050808 There was great joy in that city.
050809 But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,
050810 to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is that great power of God."
050811 They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.
050812 But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
050813 Simon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed.
050814 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,
050815 who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;
050816 for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.
050817 Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
050818 Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
050819 saying, "Give me also this power, that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."
050820 But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
050821 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn't right before God.
050822 Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.
050823 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."
050824 Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me."
050825 They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans.
050826 But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert."
050827 He arose and went; and behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.
050828 He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
050829 The Spirit said to Philip, "Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."
050830 Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
050831 He said, "How can I, unless someone explains it to me?" He begged Philip to come up and sit with him.
050832 Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter. As a lamb before his shearer is silent, so he doesn't open his mouth.
050833 In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away. Who will declare His generation? For his life is taken from the earth."
050834 The eunuch answered Philip, "Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?"
050835 Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus.
050836 As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being baptized?"
050837 
050838 He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
050839 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn't see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing.
050840 But Philip was found at Azotus. Passing through, he preached the Good News to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
050901 But Saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
050902 and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
050903 As he traveled, it happened that he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him.
050904 He fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
050905 He said, "Who are you, Lord?" The Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
050906 But rise up, and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do."
050907 The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one.
050908 Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
050909 He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.
050910 Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias!" He said, "Behold, it's me, Lord."
050911 The Lord said to him, "Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judah for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,
050912 and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight."
050913 But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem.
050914 Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name."
050915 But the Lord said to him, "Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings, and the children of Israel.
050916 For I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake."
050917 Ananias departed, and entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
050918 Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized.
050919 He took food and was strengthened. Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus.
050920 Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ, that he is the Son of God.
050921 All who heard him were amazed, and said, "Isn't this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!"
050922 But Saul increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
050923 When many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together to kill him,
050924 but their plot became known to Saul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,
050925 but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
050926 When Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
050927 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
050928 He was with them entering into Jerusalem,
050929 preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus. He spoke and disputed against the Hellenists, but they were seeking to kill him.
050930 When the brothers knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus.
050931 So the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.
050932 It happened, as Peter went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
050933 There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed.
050934 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!" Immediately he arose.
050935 All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
050936 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did.
050937 It happened in those days that she fell sick, and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
050938 As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them.
050939 Peter got up and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber. All the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.
050940 Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, get up!" She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
050941 He gave her his hand, and raised her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
050942 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
050943 It happened, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.
051001 Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,
051002 a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God.
051003 At about the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, "Cornelius!"
051004 He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, "What is it, Lord?" He said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God.
051005 Now send men to Joppa, and get Simon, who is surnamed Peter.
051006 He lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."
051007 When the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually.
051008 Having explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
051009 Now on the next day as they were on their journey, and got close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon.
051010 He became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance.
051011 He saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,
051012 in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky.
051013 A voice came to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat!"
051014 But Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."
051015 A voice came to him again the second time, "What God has cleansed, you must not call unclean."
051016 This was done three times, and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven.
051017 Now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,
051018 and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there.
051019 While Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men seek you.
051020 But arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them."
051021 Peter went down to the men, and said, "Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?"
051022 They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say."
051023 So he called them in and lodged them. On the next day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
051024 On the next day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends.
051025 When it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.
051026 But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up! I myself am also a man."
051027 As he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together.
051028 He said to them, "You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I shouldn't call any man unholy or unclean.
051029 Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"
051030 Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour, I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
051031 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God.
051032 Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside. When he comes, he will speak to you.'
051033 Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God."
051034 Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism;
051035 but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.
051036 The word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ--he is Lord of all--
051037 that spoken word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
051038 even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
051039 We are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they also killed, hanging him on a tree.
051040 God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,
051041 not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
051042 He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.
051043 All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins."
051044 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.
051045 They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.
051046 For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,
051047 "Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?"
051048 He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days.
051101 Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
051102 When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,
051103 saying, "You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!"
051104 But Peter began, and explained to them in order, saying,
051105 "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me.
051106 When I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky.
051107 I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat!'
051108 But I said, 'Not so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'
051109 But a voice answered me the second time out of heaven, 'What God has cleansed, don't you call unclean.'
051110 This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.
051111 Behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.
051112 The Spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house.
051113 He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa, and get Simon, whose surname is Peter,
051114 who will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your house.'
051115 As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.
051116 I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'
051117 If then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?"
051118 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!"
051119 They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews only.
051120 But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus.
051121 The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.
051122 The report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem. They sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,
051123 who, when he had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain near to the Lord.
051124 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.
051125 Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look for Saul.
051126 When he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. It happened, that for a whole year they were gathered together with the assembly, and taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
051127 Now in these days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
051128 One of them named Agabus stood up, and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius.
051129 As any of the disciples had plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;
051130 which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
051201 Now about that time, King Herod stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly.
051202 He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.
051203 When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This was during the days of unleavened bread.
051204 When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.
051205 Peter therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him.
051206 The same night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.
051207 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side, and woke him up, saying, "Stand up quickly!" His chains fell off from his hands.
051208 The angel said to him, "Get dressed and put on your sandals." He did so. He said to him, "Put on your cloak, and follow me."
051209 And he went out and followed him. He didn't know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.
051210 When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went out, and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.
051211 When Peter had come to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting."
051212 Thinking about that, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
051213 When Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.
051214 When she recognized Peter's voice, she didn't open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that Peter was standing in front of the gate.
051215 They said to her, "You are crazy!" But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."
051216 But Peter continued knocking. When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.
051217 But he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, "Tell these things to James, and to the brothers." Then he departed, and went to another place.
051218 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter.
051219 When Herod had sought for him, and didn't find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.
051220 Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus, the king's personal aide, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.
051221 On an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them.
051222 The people shouted, "The voice of a god, and not of a man!"
051223 Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he didn't give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.
051224 But the word of God grew and multiplied.
051225 Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also taking with them John whose surname was Mark.
051301 Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
051302 As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them."
051303 Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
051304 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.
051305 When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They had also John as their attendant.
051306 When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar Jesus,
051307 who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.
051308 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.
051309 But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,
051310 and said, "Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
051311 Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!" Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
051312 Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
051313 Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
051314 But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.
051315 After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak."
051316 Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.
051317 The God of this people chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it.
051318 For a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.
051319 When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred fifty years.
051320 After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
051321 Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
051322 When he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also testified, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'
051323 From this man's seed, God has brought salvation to Israel according to his promise,
051324 before his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to Israel.
051325 As John was fulfilling his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
051326 Brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent out to you.
051327 For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn't know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
051328 Though they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed.
051329 When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.
051330 But God raised him from the dead,
051331 and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
051332 We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,
051333 that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second psalm, 'You are my Son. Today I have become your father.'
051334 "Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
051335 Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'
051336 For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw decay.
051337 But he whom God raised up saw no decay.
051338 Be it known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,
051339 and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
051340 Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:
051341 'Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you.'"
051342 So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.
051343 Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.
051344 The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.
051345 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.
051346 Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, "It was necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
051347 For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, 'I have set you as a light for the Gentiles, that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"
051348 As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
051349 The Lord's word was spread abroad throughout all the region.
051350 But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.
051351 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
051352 The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.
051401 It happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.
051402 But the disbelieving Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers.
051403 Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
051404 But the multitude of the city was divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
051405 When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,
051406 they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.
051407 There they preached the Good News.
051408 At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.
051409 He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,
051410 said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" He leaped up and walked.
051411 When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"
051412 They called Barnabas "Jupiter," and Paul "Mercury," because he was the chief speaker.
051413 The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes.
051414 But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,
051415 "Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;
051416 who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.
051417 Yet he didn't leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
051418 Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them.
051419 But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
051420 But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.
051421 When they had preached the Good News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
051422 confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God.
051423 When they had appointed elders for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.
051424 They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.
051425 When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
051426 From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.
051427 When they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.
051428 They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.
051501 Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you can't be saved."
051502 Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.
051503 They, being sent on their way by the assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the brothers.
051504 When they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all things that God had done with them.
051505 But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."
051506 The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.
051507 When there had been much discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News, and believe.
051508 God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us.
051509 He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
051510 Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
051511 But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are."
051512 All the multitude kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the nations through them.
051513 After they were silent, James answered, "Brothers, listen to me.
051514 Simeon has reported how God first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for his name.
051515 This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,
051516 'After these things I will return. I will again build the tabernacle of David, which has fallen. I will again build its ruins. I will set it up,
051517 That the rest of men may seek after the Lord; All the Gentiles who are called by my name, Says the Lord, who does all these things.
051518 All his works are known to God from eternity.'
051519 "Therefore my judgment is that we don't trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God,
051520 but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.
051521 For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
051522 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers.
051523 They wrote these things by their hand: "The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: greetings.
051524 Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, 'You must be circumcised and keep the law,' to whom we gave no commandment;
051525 it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
051526 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
051527 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.
051528 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things:
051529 that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. Farewell."
051530 So, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.
051531 When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.
051532 Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and strengthened them.
051533 After they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles.
051534 
051535 But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
051536 After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing."
051537 Barnabas planned to take John, who was called Mark, with them also.
051538 But Paul didn't think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and didn't go with them to do the work.
051539 Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away to Cyprus,
051540 but Paul chose Silas, and went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God.
051541 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.
051601 He came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess who believed; but his father was a Greek.
051602 The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him.
051603 Paul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
051604 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.
051605 So the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
051606 When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
051607 When they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit didn't allow them.
051608 Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
051609 A vision appeared to Paul in the night. There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."
051610 When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them.
051611 Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;
051612 and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.
051613 On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together.
051614 A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.
051615 When she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay." So she persuaded us.
051616 It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.
051617 Following Paul and us, she cried out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us a way of salvation!"
051618 She was doing this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" It came out that very hour.
051619 But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
051620 When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men, being Jews, are agitating our city,
051621 and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans."
051622 The multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods.
051623 When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,
051624 who, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.
051625 But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
051626 Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened.
051627 The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
051628 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, "Don't harm yourself, for we are all here!"
051629 He called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,
051630 and brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
051631 They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household."
051632 They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house.
051633 He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.
051634 He brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having believed in God.
051635 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, "Let those men go."
051636 The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace."
051637 But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No, most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!"
051638 The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,
051639 and they came and begged them. When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.
051640 They went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia's house. When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.
051701 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
051702 Paul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
051703 explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ."
051704 Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women.
051705 But the unpersuaded Jews took along some wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.
051706 When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying, "These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,
051707 whom Jason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!"
051708 The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.
051709 When they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
051710 The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
051711 Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
051712 Many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few men.
051713 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.
051714 Then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there.
051715 But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly, they departed.
051716 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.
051717 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him.
051718 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also were conversing with him. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "He seems to be advocating foreign deities," because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.
051719 They took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?
051720 For you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean."
051721 Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.
051722 Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, "You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things.
051723 For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: 'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.
051724 The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn't dwell in temples made with hands,
051725 neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things.
051726 He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings,
051727 that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.
051728 'For in him we live, and move, and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'
051729 Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man.
051730 The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,
051731 because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead."
051732 Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, "We want to hear you again concerning this."
051733 Thus Paul went out from among them.
051734 But certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
051801 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.
051802 He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He came to them,
051803 and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.
051804 He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
051805 But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
051806 When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!"
051807 He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.
051808 Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.
051809 The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, "Don't be afraid, but speak and don't be silent;
051810 for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city."
051811 He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
051812 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,
051813 saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."
051814 But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;
051815 but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don't want to be a judge of these matters."
051816 He drove them from the judgment seat.
051817 Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio didn't care about any of these things.
051818 Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.
051819 He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
051820 When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;
051821 but taking his leave of them, and saying, "I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus.
051822 When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.
051823 Having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.
051824 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures.
051825 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.
051826 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
051827 When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;
051828 for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
051901 It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.
051902 He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said to him, "No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
051903 He said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into John's baptism."
051904 Paul said, "John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus."
051905 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
051906 When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied.
051907 They were about twelve men in all.
051908 He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God.
051909 But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
051910 This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
051911 God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,
051912 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out.
051913 But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
051914 There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.
051915 The evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?"
051916 The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
051917 This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
051918 Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.
051919 Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
051920 So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty.
051921 Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
051922 Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
051923 About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
051924 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,
051925 whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, "Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.
051926 You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.
051927 Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships."
051928 When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
051929 The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.
051930 When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples didn't allow him.
051931 Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.
051932 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn't know why they had come together.
051933 They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people.
051934 But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
051935 When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?
051936 Seeing then that these things can't be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
051937 For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.
051938 If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another.
051939 But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.
051940 For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause. Concerning it, we wouldn't be able to give an account of this commotion."
051941 When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
052001 After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.
052002 When he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words, he came into Greece.
052003 When he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.
052004 These accompanied him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
052005 But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.
052006 We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.
052007 On the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight.
052008 There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.
052009 A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.
052010 Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said, "Don't be troubled, for his life is in him."
052011 When he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.
052012 They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.
052013 But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.
052014 When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.
052015 Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus.
052016 For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
052017 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly.
052018 When they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,
052019 serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;
052020 how I didn't shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,
052021 testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.
052022 Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;
052023 except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.
052024 But these things don't count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God.
052025 "Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
052026 Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men,
052027 for I didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
052028 Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood.
052029 For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
052030 Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
052031 Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I didn't cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.
052032 Now, brothers, I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
052033 I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing.
052034 You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me.
052035 In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
052036 When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
052037 They all wept a lot, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,
052038 sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
052101 When it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
052102 Having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.
052103 When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo.
052104 Having found disciples, we stayed there seven days. These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
052105 When it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.
052106 After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.
052107 When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.
052108 On the next day, we, who were Paul's companions, departed, and came to Caesarea. We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
052109 Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
052110 As we stayed there some days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
052111 Coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit: 'So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'"
052112 When we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
052113 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
052114 When he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The Lord's will be done."
052115 After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
052116 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.
052117 When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.
052118 The day following, Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.
052119 When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.
052120 They, when they heard it, glorified God. They said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.
052121 They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.
052122 What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.
052123 Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.
052124 Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law.
052125 But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality."
052126 Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.
052127 When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,
052128 crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!"
052129 For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
052130 All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut.
052131 As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
052132 Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.
052133 Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.
052134 Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd. When he couldn't find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.
052135 When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;
052136 for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, "Away with him!"
052137 As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, "May I speak to you?" He said, "Do you know Greek?
052138 Aren't you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?"
052139 But Paul said, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."
052140 When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,
052201 "Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now make to you."
052202 When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. He said,
052203 "I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are this day.
052204 I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
052205 As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.
052206 It happened that, as I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me.
052207 I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
052208 I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.'
052209 "Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they didn't understand the voice of him who spoke to me.
052210 I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Arise, and go into Damascus. There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.'
052211 When I couldn't see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.
052212 One Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,
052213 came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' In that very hour I looked up at him.
052214 He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.
052215 For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
052216 Now why do you wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.'
052217 "It happened that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,
052218 and saw him saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you.'
052219 I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you.
052220 When the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.'
052221 "He said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the Gentiles.'"
052222 They listened to him until he said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, "Rid the earth of this fellow, for he isn't fit to live!"
052223 As they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,
052224 the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like that.
052225 When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?"
052226 When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, "Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman!"
052227 The commanding officer came and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes."
052228 The commanding officer answered, "I bought my citizenship for a great price." Paul said, "But I was born a Roman."
052229 Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.
052230 But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.
052301 Paul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, "Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day."
052302 The high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
052303 Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?"
052304 Those who stood by said, "Do you malign God's high priest?"
052305 Paul said, "I didn't know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"
052306 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"
052307 When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
052308 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.
052309 A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying, "We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let's not fight against God!"
052310 When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.
052311 The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said, "Cheer up, Paul, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome."
052312 When it was day, some of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
052313 There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.
052314 They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.
052315 Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are ready to kill him before he comes near."
052316 But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.
052317 Paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, "Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him."
052318 So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer, and said, "Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to tell you."
052319 The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"
052320 He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.
052321 Therefore don't yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."
052322 So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, "Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me."
052323 He called to himself two of the centurions, and said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night."
052324 He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
052325 He wrote a letter like this:
052326 "Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
052327 "This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
052328 Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.
052329 I found him to be accused about questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of death or of imprisonment.
052330 When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you. Farewell."
052331 So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
052332 But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks.
052333 When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
052334 When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,
052335 "I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive." He commanded that he be kept in Herod's palace.
052401 After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.
052402 When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,
052403 we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
052404 But, that I don't delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.
052405 For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
052406 He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.
052407 
052408 By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him."
052409 The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.
052410 When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,
052411 seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.
052412 In the temple they didn't find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.
052413 Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.
052414 But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;
052415 having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
052416 Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.
052417 Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;
052418 amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.
052419 They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.
052420 Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,
052421 unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!'"
052422 But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case."
052423 He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.
052424 But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
052425 As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you."
052426 Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.
052427 But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.
052501 Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
052502 Then the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him,
052503 asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill him on the way.
052504 However Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly.
052505 "Let them therefore," said he, "that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him."
052506 When he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.
052507 When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove,
052508 while he said in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all."
052509 But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these things?"
052510 But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.
052511 For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I don't refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!"
052512 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall go."
052513 Now when some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.
052514 As he stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;
052515 about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him.
052516 To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, before the accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.
052517 When therefore they had come together here, I didn't delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought.
052518 Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;
052519 but had certain questions against him about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
052520 Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.
052521 But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."
052522 Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he said, "you shall hear him."
052523 So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
052524 Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
052525 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.
052526 Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write.
052527 For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him."
052601 Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.
052602 "I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things that I am accused by the Jews,
052603 especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.
052604 "Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;
052605 having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
052606 Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,
052607 which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa!
052608 Why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?
052609 "I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
052610 This I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.
052611 Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
052612 "Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests,
052613 at noon, O king, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me.
052614 When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
052615 "I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' "He said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
052616 But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you;
052617 delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,
052618 to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'
052619 "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
052620 but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.
052621 For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me.
052622 Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen,
052623 how the Christ must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles."
052624 As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!"
052625 But he said, "I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness.
052626 For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner.
052627 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
052628 Agrippa said to Paul, "With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?"
052629 Paul said, "I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these bonds."
052630 The king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.
052631 When they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, "This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
052632 Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
052701 When it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.
052702 Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
052703 The next day, we touched at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself.
052704 Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
052705 When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
052706 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board.
052707 When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
052708 With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
052709 When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them,
052710 and said to them, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
052711 But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul.
052712 Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.
052713 When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.
052714 But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Euroclydon.
052715 When the ship was caught, and couldn't face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along.
052716 Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.
052717 After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along.
052718 As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.
052719 On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands.
052720 When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.
052721 When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.
052722 Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
052723 For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,
052724 saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'
052725 Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.
052726 But we must run aground on a certain island."
052727 But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.
052728 They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms. After a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.
052729 Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight.
052730 As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,
052731 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these stay in the ship, you can't be saved."
052732 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
052733 While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.
052734 Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads."
052735 When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat.
052736 Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.
052737 In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.
052738 When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
052739 When it was day, they didn't recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it.
052740 Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
052741 But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.
052742 The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.
052743 But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;
052744 and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land.
052801 When we had escaped, then they learned that the island was called Malta.
052802 The natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
052803 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
052804 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed to live."
052805 However he shook off the creature into the fire, and wasn't harmed.
052806 But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
052807 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for three days.
052808 It happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.
052809 Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured.
052810 They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.
052811 After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Brothers."
052812 Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.
052813 From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,
052814 where we found brothers, and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome.
052815 From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.
052816 When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
052817 It happened that after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,
052818 who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.
052819 But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.
052820 For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
052821 They said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.
052822 But we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."
052823 When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.
052824 Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.
052825 When they didn't agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, "The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,
052826 saying, 'Go to this people, and say, in hearing, you will hear, but will in no way understand. In seeing, you will see, but will in no way perceive.
052827 For this people's heart has grown callous. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.'
052828 "Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations. They will also listen."
052829 When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.
052830 Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him,
052831 preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.
060101 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God,
060102 which he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
060103 concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
060104 who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,
060105 through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake;
060106 among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ;
060107 to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
060108 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
060109 For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,
060110 requesting, if by any means now at last I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.
060111 For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established;
060112 that is, that I with you may be encouraged in you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine.
060113 Now I don't desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.
060114 I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.
060115 So, as much as is in me, I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome.
060116 For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes; for the Jew first, and also for the Greek.
060117 For in it is revealed God's righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, "But the righteous shall live by faith."
060118 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
060119 because that which is known of God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them.
060120 For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse.
060121 Because, knowing God, they didn't glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.
060122 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
060123 and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.
060124 Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,
060125 who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
060126 For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature.
060127 Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.
060128 Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;
060129 being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,
060130 backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
060131 without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;
060132 who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them.
060201 Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.
060202 We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.
060203 Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?
060204 Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?
060205 But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;
060206 who "will pay back to everyone according to their works:"
060207 to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;
060208 but to those who are self-seeking, and don't obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,
060209 oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
060210 But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
060211 For there is no partiality with God.
060212 For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
060213 For it isn't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified
060214 (for when Gentiles who don't have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,
060215 in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)
060216 in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.
060217 Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,
060218 and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
060219 and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
060220 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.
060221 You therefore who teach another, don't you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn't steal, do you steal?
060222 You who say a man shouldn't commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
060223 You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?
060224 For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you," just as it is written.
060225 For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
060226 If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?
060227 Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?
060228 For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;
060229 but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.
060301 Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision?
060302 Much in every way! Because first of all, they were entrusted with the oracles of God.
060303 For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?
060304 May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, "That you might be justified in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment."
060305 But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.
060306 May it never be! For then how will God judge the world?
060307 For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?
060308 Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), "Let us do evil, that good may come?" Those who say so are justly condemned.
060309 What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.
060310 As it is written, "There is no one righteous; no, not one.
060311 There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks after God.
060312 They have all turned aside. They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one."
060313 "Their throat is an open tomb. With their tongues they have used deceit." "The poison of vipers is under their lips;"
060314 "Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."
060315 "Their feet are swift to shed blood.
060316 Destruction and misery are in their ways.
060317 The way of peace, they haven't known."
060318 "There is no fear of God before their eyes."
060319 Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.
060320 Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
060321 But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;
060322 even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction,
060323 for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;
060324 being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;
060325 whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God's forbearance;
060326 to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.
060327 Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what manner of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.
060328 We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
060329 Or is God the God of Jews only? Isn't he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
060330 since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.
060331 Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law.
060401 What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?
060402 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward God.
060403 For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
060404 Now to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as debt.
060405 But to him who doesn't work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.
060406 Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,
060407 "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
060408 Blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin."
060409 Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.
060410 How then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
060411 He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them.
060412 The father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.
060413 For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn't through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
060414 For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.
060415 For the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience.
060416 For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
060417 As it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations." This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were.
060418 Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, "So will your seed be."
060419 Without being weakened in faith, he didn't consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb.
060420 Yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn't waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God,
060421 and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
060422 Therefore it also was "reckoned to him for righteousness."
060423 Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,
060424 but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead,
060425 who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.
060501 Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
060502 through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
060503 Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance;
060504 and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:
060505 and hope doesn't disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
060506 For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
060507 For one will hardly die for a righteous man. Yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die.
060508 But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
060509 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God's wrath through him.
060510 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.
060511 Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
060512 Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, because all sinned.
060513 For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law.
060514 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren't like Adam's disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come.
060515 But the free gift isn't like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.
060516 The gift is not as through one who sinned: for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification.
060517 For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.
060518 So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life.
060519 For as through the one man's disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous.
060520 The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly;
060521 that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
060601 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
060602 May it never be! We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer?
060603 Or don't you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
060604 We were buried therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.
060605 For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;
060606 knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin.
060607 For he who has died has been freed from sin.
060608 But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him;
060609 knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!
060610 For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.
060611 Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
060612 Therefore don't let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.
060613 Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
060614 For sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace.
060615 What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be!
060616 Don't you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
060617 But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered.
060618 Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness.
060619 I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification.
060620 For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
060621 What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
060622 But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life.
060623 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
060701 Or don't you know, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?
060702 For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.
060703 So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.
060704 Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.
060705 For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.
060706 But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
060707 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn't have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn't have known coveting, unless the law had said, "You shall not covet."
060708 But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.
060709 I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
060710 The commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;
060711 for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.
060712 Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.
060713 Did then that which is good become death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.
060714 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.
060715 For I don't know what I am doing. For I don't practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.
060716 But if what I don't desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.
060717 So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.
060718 For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don't find it doing that which is good.
060719 For the good which I desire, I don't do; but the evil which I don't desire, that I practice.
060720 But if what I don't desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.
060721 I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.
060722 For I delight in God's law after the inward man,
060723 but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.
060724 What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?
060725 I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I myself serve God's law, but with the flesh, the sin's law.
060801 There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don't walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
060802 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.
060803 For what the law couldn't do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;
060804 that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
060805 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
060806 For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;
060807 because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to God's law, neither indeed can it be.
060808 Those who are in the flesh can't please God.
060809 But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any man doesn't have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.
060810 If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.
060811 But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.
060812 So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
060813 For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
060814 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God.
060815 For you didn't receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, "Abba! Father!"
060816 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;
060817 and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.
060818 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.
060819 For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.
060820 For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope
060821 that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
060822 For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.
060823 Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.
060824 For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?
060825 But if we hope for that which we don't see, we wait for it with patience.
060826 In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don't know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can't be uttered.
060827 He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.
060828 We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
060829 For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
060830 Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified.
060831 What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
060832 He who didn't spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?
060833 Who could bring a charge against God's chosen ones? It is God who justifies.
060834 Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.
060835 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
060836 Even as it is written, "For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
060837 No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
060838 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
060839 nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
060901 I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,
060902 that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
060903 For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers' sake, my relatives according to the flesh,
060904 who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;
060905 of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.
060906 But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.
060907 Neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children. But, "In Isaac will your seed be called."
060908 That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.
060909 For this is a word of promise, "At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son."
060910 Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.
060911 For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,
060912 it was said to her, "The elder will serve the younger."
060913 Even as it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
060914 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!
060915 For he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
060916 So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.
060917 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
060918 So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.
060919 You will say then to me, "Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?"
060920 But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?"
060921 Or hasn't the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?
060922 What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,
060923 and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,
060924 us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?
060925 As he says also in Hosea, "I will call them 'my people,' which were not my people; and her 'beloved,' who was not beloved."
060926 "It will be that in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' There they will be called 'children of the living God.'"
060927 Isaiah cries concerning Israel, "If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved;
060928 for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth."
060929 As Isaiah has said before, "Unless the Lord of Armies had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah."
060930 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn't follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;
060931 but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn't arrive at the law of righteousness.
060932 Why? Because they didn't seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;
060933 even as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed."
061001 Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.
061002 For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
061003 For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn't subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
061004 For Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
061005 For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, "The one who does them will live by them."
061006 But the righteousness which is of faith says this, "Don't say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down);
061007 or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)"
061008 But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;" that is, the word of faith, which we preach:
061009 that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
061010 For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
061011 For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed."
061012 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.
061013 For, "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved."
061014 How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?
061015 And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!"
061016 But they didn't all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"
061017 So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
061018 But I say, didn't they hear? Yes, most certainly, "Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world."
061019 But I ask, didn't Israel know? First Moses says, "I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry."
061020 Isaiah is very bold, and says, "I was found by those who didn't seek me. I was revealed to those who didn't ask for me."
061021 But as to Israel he says, "All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."
061101 I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
061102 God didn't reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don't you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:
061103 "Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
061104 But how does God answer him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
061105 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
061106 And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.
061107 What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn't obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.
061108 According as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day."
061109 David says, "Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.
061110 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always."
061111 I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
061112 Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?
061113 For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;
061114 if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.
061115 For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?
061116 If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.
061117 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;
061118 don't boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.
061119 You will say then, "Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."
061120 True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don't be conceited, but fear;
061121 for if God didn't spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
061122 See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
061123 They also, if they don't continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
061124 For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
061125 For I don't desire you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,
061126 and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, "There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
061127 This is my covenant to them, when I will take away their sins."
061128 Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.
061129 For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
061130 For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,
061131 even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.
061132 For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.
061133 Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!
061134 "For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?"
061135 "Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to him again?"
061136 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.
061201 Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.
061202 Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.
061203 For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.
061204 For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don't have the same function,
061205 so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
061206 Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;
061207 or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;
061208 or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
061209 Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.
061210 In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;
061211 not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
061212 rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;
061213 contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.
061214 Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don't curse.
061215 Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.
061216 Be of the same mind one toward another. Don't set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don't be wise in your own conceits.
061217 Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.
061218 If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.
061219 Don't seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath. For it is written, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord."
061220 Therefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head."
061221 Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
061301 Let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those who exist are ordained by God.
061302 Therefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance of God; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment.
061303 For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same,
061304 for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn't bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil.
061305 Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake.
061306 For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God's service, attending continually on this very thing.
061307 Give therefore to everyone what you owe: taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor.
061308 Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
061309 For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," "You shall not give false testimony," "You shall not covet," and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
061310 Love doesn't harm a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.
061311 Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed.
061312 The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let's put on the armor of light.
061313 Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy.
061314 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.
061401 Now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions.
061402 One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables.
061403 Don't let him who eats despise him who doesn't eat. Don't let him who doesn't eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him.
061404 Who are you who judge another's servant? To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand, for God has power to make him stand.
061405 One man esteems one day as more important. Another esteems every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.
061406 He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn't eat, to the Lord he doesn't eat, and gives God thanks.
061407 For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.
061408 For if we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord's.
061409 For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
061410 But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
061411 For it is written, "'As I live,' says the Lord, 'to me every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess to God.'"
061412 So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.
061413 Therefore let's not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way, or an occasion for falling.
061414 I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
061415 Yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love. Don't destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.
061416 Then don't let your good be slandered,
061417 for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
061418 For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.
061419 So then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up.
061420 Don't overthrow God's work for food's sake. All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating.
061421 It is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made weak.
061422 Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who doesn't judge himself in that which he approves.
061423 But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isn't of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.\NOTE: SEE Romans 16:25-16:27 for World English Bible Romans 14:24-14:26 (the translators had moved and renumbered these verses from their standard location of 16:25-27. They are left intact there for 1551 inter-Bible compatability).
061501 Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
061502 Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up.
061503 For even Christ didn't please himself. But, as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me."
061504 For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
061505 Now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus,
061506 that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
061507 Therefore accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you, to the glory of God.
061508 Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,
061509 and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name."
061510 Again he says, "Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people."
061511 Again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles! Let all the peoples praise him."
061512 Again, Isaiah says, "There will be the root of Jesse, he who arises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles will hope."
061513 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
061514 I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.
061515 But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God,
061516 that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest the Good News of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
061517 I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.
061518 For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
061519 in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God's Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;
061520 yes, making it my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build on another's foundation.
061521 But, as it is written, "They will see, to whom no news of him came. They who haven't heard will understand."
061522 Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you,
061523 but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you,
061524 whenever I journey to Spain, I will come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.
061525 But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.
061526 For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.
061527 Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things.
061528 When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain.
061529 I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.
061530 Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,
061531 that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;
061532 that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.
061533 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
061601 I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the assembly that is at Cenchreae,
061602 that you receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self.
061603 Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
061604 who for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the Gentiles.
061605 Greet the assembly that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.
061606 Greet Mary, who labored much for us.
061607 Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
061608 Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.
061609 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.
061610 Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus.
061611 Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet them of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
061612 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.
061613 Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
061614 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.
061615 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
061616 Greet one another with a holy kiss. The assemblies of Christ greet you.
061617 Now I beg you, brothers, look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.
061618 For those who are such don't serve our Lord, Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent.
061619 For your obedience has become known to all. I rejoice therefore over you. But I desire to have you wise in that which is good, but innocent in that which is evil.
061620 And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
061621 Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives.
061622 I, Tertius, who write the letter, greet you in the Lord.
061623 Gaius, my host and host of the whole assembly, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, as does Quartus, the brother.
061624 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen.
061625 (The World English Bible moved this verse to 14:24) [14:24] Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages,
061626 (The World English Bible moved this verse to 14:25) [14:25] but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations;
061627 (The World English Bible moved this verse to 14:26) [14:26] to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.
070101 Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
070102 to the assembly of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:
070103 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
070104 I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;
070105 that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;
070106 even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
070107 so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
070108 who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
070109 God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
070110 Now I beg you, brothers, through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
070111 For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe's household, that there are contentions among you.
070112 Now I mean this, that each one of you says, "I follow Paul," "I follow Apollos," "I follow Cephas," and, "I follow Christ."
070113 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?
070114 I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,
070115 so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.
070116 (I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether I baptized any other.)
070117 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News--not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn't be made void.
070118 For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.
070119 For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing."
070120 Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
070121 For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.
070122 For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,
070123 but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,
070124 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
070125 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
070126 For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;
070127 but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;
070128 and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:
070129 that no flesh should boast before God.
070130 But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:
070131 that, according as it is written, "He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."
070201 When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
070202 For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
070203 I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.
070204 My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
070205 that your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
070206 We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.
070207 But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,
070208 which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of glory.
070209 But as it is written, "Things which an eye didn't see, and an ear didn't hear, which didn't enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him."
070210 But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.
070211 For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's Spirit.
070212 But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.
070213 Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
070214 Now the natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can't know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
070215 But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.
070216 "For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we have Christ's mind.
070301 Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.
070302 I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,
070303 for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk in the ways of men?
070304 For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," aren't you fleshly?
070305 Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?
070306 I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.
070307 So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.
070308 Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
070309 For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's farming, God's building.
070310 According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.
070311 For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.
070312 But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;
070313 each man's work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is.
070314 If any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.
070315 If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.
070316 Don't you know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?
070317 If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are.
070318 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
070319 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He has taken the wise in their craftiness."
070320 And again, "The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless."
070321 Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,
070322 whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,
070323 and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
070401 So let a man think of us as Christ's servants, and stewards of God's mysteries.
070402 Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful.
070403 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment. Yes, I don't judge my own self.
070404 For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord.
070405 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get his praise from God.
070406 Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another.
070407 For who makes you different? And what do you have that you didn't receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
070408 You are already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.
070409 For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.
070410 We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honor, but we have dishonor.
070411 Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place.
070412 We toil, working with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure.
070413 Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now.
070414 I don't write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
070415 For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News.
070416 I beg you therefore, be imitators of me.
070417 Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly.
070418 Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
070419 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.
070420 For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
070421 What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?
070501 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father's wife.
070502 You are puffed up, and didn't rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.
070503 For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.
070504 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
070505 are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
070506 Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?
070507 Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.
070508 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
070509 I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;
070510 yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.
070511 But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don't even eat with such a person.
070512 For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don't you judge those who are within?
070513 But those who are outside, God judges. "Put away the wicked man from among yourselves."
070601 Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
070602 Don't you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
070603 Don't you know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?
070604 If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?
070605 I say this to move you to shame. Isn't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?
070606 But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!
070607 Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?
070608 No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers.
070609 Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,
070610 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God.
070611 Such were some of you, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.
070612 "All things are lawful for me," but not all things are expedient. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be brought under the power of anything.
070613 "Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods," but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
070614 Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.
070615 Don't you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!
070616 Or don't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, "The two," says he, "will become one flesh."
070617 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
070618 Flee sexual immorality! "Every sin that a man does is outside the body," but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.
070619 Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God? You are not your own,
070620 for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
070701 Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
070702 But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
070703 Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.
070704 The wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but the wife.
070705 Don't deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
070706 But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.
070707 Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.
070708 But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.
070709 But if they don't have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to burn.
070710 But to the married I command--not I, but the Lord--that the wife not leave her husband
070711 (but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.
070712 But to the rest I--not the Lord--say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.
070713 The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband.
070714 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
070715 Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.
070716 For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
070717 Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the assemblies.
070718 Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
070719 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
070720 Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called.
070721 Were you called being a bondservant? Don't let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it.
070722 For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant.
070723 You were bought with a price. Don't become bondservants of men.
070724 Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.
070725 Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.
070726 I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is.
070727 Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don't seek a wife.
070728 But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.
070729 But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;
070730 and those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn't rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn't possess;
070731 and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.
070732 But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
070733 but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.
070734 There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world--how she may please her husband.
070735 This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.
070736 But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn't sin. Let them marry.
070737 But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well.
070738 So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn't give her in marriage does better.
070739 A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord.
070740 But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit.
070801 Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
070802 But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn't yet know as he ought to know.
070803 But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.
070804 Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
070805 For though there are things that are called "gods," whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many "gods" and many "lords;"
070806 yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.
070807 However, that knowledge isn't in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
070808 But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don't eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.
070809 But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.
070810 For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
070811 And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
070812 Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
070813 Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don't cause my brother to stumble.
070901 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren't you my work in the Lord?
070902 If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
070903 My defense to those who examine me is this.
070904 Have we no right to eat and to drink?
070905 Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
070906 Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?
070907 What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn't eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn't drink from the flock's milk?
070908 Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn't the law also say the same thing?
070909 For it is written in the law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain." Is it for the oxen that God cares,
070910 or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope.
070911 If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?
070912 If others partake of this right over you, don't we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ.
070913 Don't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?
070914 Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.
070915 But I have used none of these things, and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void.
070916 For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don't preach the Good News.
070917 For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.
070918 What then is my reward? That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.
070919 For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.
070920 To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;
070921 to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law.
070922 To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.
070923 Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it.
070924 Don't you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may win.
070925 Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.
070926 I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air,
070927 but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
071001 Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
071002 and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
071003 and all ate the same spiritual food;
071004 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.
071005 However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
071006 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
071007 Neither be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
071008 Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.
071009 Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.
071010 Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.
071011 Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.
071012 Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn't fall.
071013 No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
071014 Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
071015 I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say.
071016 The cup of blessing which we bless, isn't it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn't it a sharing of the body of Christ?
071017 Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread.
071018 Consider Israel according to the flesh. Don't those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?
071019 What am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
071020 But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don't desire that you would have fellowship with demons.
071021 You can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.
071022 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
071023 "All things are lawful for me," but not all things are profitable. "All things are lawful for me," but not all things build up.
071024 Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor's good.
071025 Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,
071026 for "the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness."
071027 But if one of those who don't believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.
071028 But if anyone says to you, "This was offered to idols," don't eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For "the earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness."
071029 Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?
071030 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?
071031 Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
071032 Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God;
071033 even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.
071101 Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
071102 Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.
071103 But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.
071104 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.
071105 But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.
071106 For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.
071107 For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.
071108 For man is not from woman, but woman from man;
071109 for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.
071110 For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.
071111 Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.
071112 For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.
071113 Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?
071114 Doesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
071115 But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.
071116 But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God's assemblies.
071117 But in giving you this command, I don't praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.
071118 For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.
071119 For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.
071120 When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.
071121 For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.
071122 What, don't you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to shame who don't have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don't praise you.
071123 For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
071124 When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me."
071125 In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me."
071126 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
071127 Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
071128 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
071129 For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn't discern the Lord's body.
071130 For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
071131 For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn't be judged.
071132 But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
071133 Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another.
071134 But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come.
071201 Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant.
071202 You know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.
071203 Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, "Jesus is accursed." No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," but by the Holy Spirit.
071204 Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.
071205 There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.
071206 There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.
071207 But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.
071208 For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;
071209 to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;
071210 and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.
071211 But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.
071212 For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.
071213 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.
071214 For the body is not one member, but many.
071215 If the foot would say, "Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body," it is not therefore not part of the body.
071216 If the ear would say, "Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body," it's not therefore not part of the body.
071217 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?
071218 But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.
071219 If they were all one member, where would the body be?
071220 But now they are many members, but one body.
071221 The eye can't tell the hand, "I have no need for you," or again the head to the feet, "I have no need for you."
071222 No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.
071223 Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;
071224 whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,
071225 that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.
071226 When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
071227 Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.
071228 God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.
071229 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?
071230 Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?
071231 But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.
071301 If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don't have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
071302 If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.
071303 If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don't have love, it profits me nothing.
071304 Love is patient and is kind; love doesn't envy. Love doesn't brag, is not proud,
071305 doesn't behave itself inappropriately, doesn't seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;
071306 doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
071307 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
071308 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.
071309 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
071310 but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.
071311 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things.
071312 For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.
071313 But now faith, hope, and love remain--these three. The greatest of these is love.
071401 Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.
071402 For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.
071403 But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation.
071404 He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.
071405 Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.
071406 But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?
071407 Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?
071408 For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?
071409 So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.
071410 There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning.
071411 If then I don't know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.
071412 So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.
071413 Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.
071414 For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
071415 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
071416 Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the "Amen" at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you say?
071417 For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.
071418 I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.
071419 However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.
071420 Brothers, don't be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.
071421 In the law it is written, "By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord."
071422 Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.
071423 If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won't they say that you are crazy?
071424 But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.
071425 And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.
071426 What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up.
071427 If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.
071428 But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God.
071429 Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.
071430 But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.
071431 For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.
071432 The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,
071433 for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,
071434 let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says.
071435 If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly.
071436 What? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?
071437 If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.
071438 But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
071439 Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don't forbid speaking with other languages.
071440 Let all things be done decently and in order.
071501 Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,
071502 by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you--unless you believed in vain.
071503 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
071504 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
071505 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
071506 Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep.
071507 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,
071508 and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also.
071509 For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God.
071510 But by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
071511 Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
071512 Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
071513 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.
071514 If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.
071515 Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn't raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised.
071516 For if the dead aren't raised, neither has Christ been raised.
071517 If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.
071518 Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
071519 If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.
071520 But now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.
071521 For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.
071522 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
071523 But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ's, at his coming.
071524 Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.
071525 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
071526 The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
071527 For, "He put all things in subjection under his feet." But when he says, "All things are put in subjection," it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.
071528 When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.
071529 Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren't raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?
071530 Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
071531 I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
071532 If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
071533 Don't be deceived! "Evil companionships corrupt good morals."
071534 Wake up righteously, and don't sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.
071535 But someone will say, "How are the dead raised?" and, "With what kind of body do they come?"
071536 You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.
071537 That which you sow, you don't sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.
071538 But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.
071539 All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.
071540 There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.
071541 There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.
071542 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.
071543 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
071544 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.
071545 So also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living soul." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
071546 However that which is spiritual isn't first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.
071547 The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.
071548 As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
071549 As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let's also bear the image of the heavenly.
071550 Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can't inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
071551 Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,
071552 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.
071553 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
071554 But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: "Death is swallowed up in victory."
071555 "Death, where is your sting? Hades, where is your victory?"
071556 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
071557 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
071558 Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
071601 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.
071602 On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.
071603 When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.
071604 If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.
071605 But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.
071606 But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.
071607 For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.
071608 But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,
071609 for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
071610 Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.
071611 Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.
071612 Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.
071613 Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!
071614 Let all that you do be done in love.
071615 Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),
071616 that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.
071617 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.
071618 For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.
071619 The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.
071620 All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
071621 This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.
071622 If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come, Lord!
071623 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
071624 My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
080101 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:
080102 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
080103 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;
080104 who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
080105 For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.
080106 But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.
080107 Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort.
080108 For we don't desire to have you uninformed, brothers, concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life.
080109 Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,
080110 who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;
080111 you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.
080112 For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
080113 For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;
080114 as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
080115 In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;
080116 and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea.
080117 When I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the "Yes, yes" and the "No, no?"
080118 But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not "Yes and no."
080119 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not "Yes and no," but in him is "Yes."
080120 For however many are the promises of God, in him is the "Yes." Therefore also through him is the "Amen," to the glory of God through us.
080121 Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;
080122 who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.
080123 But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you.
080124 Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in faith.
080201 But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.
080202 For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?
080203 And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.
080204 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.
080205 But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.
080206 Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;
080207 so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.
080208 Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.
080209 For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.
080210 Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,
080211 that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
080212 Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,
080213 I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.
080214 Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.
080215 For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;
080216 to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?
080217 For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.
080301 Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?
080302 You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
080303 being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.
080304 Such confidence we have through Christ toward God;
080305 not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;
080306 who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
080307 But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:
080308 won't service of the Spirit be with much more glory?
080309 For if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.
080310 For most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.
080311 For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.
080312 Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,
080313 and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away.
080314 But their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in Christ it passes away.
080315 But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.
080316 But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
080317 Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
080318 But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.
080401 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we don't faint.
080402 But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
080403 Even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;
080404 in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.
080405 For we don't preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake;
080406 seeing it is God who said, "Light will shine out of darkness," who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
080407 But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.
080408 We are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;
080409 pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;
080410 always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
080411 For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.
080412 So then death works in us, but life in you.
080413 But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, "I believed, and therefore I spoke." We also believe, and therefore also we speak;
080414 knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.
080415 For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
080416 Therefore we don't faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.
080417 For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;
080418 while we don't look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
080501 For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
080502 For most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;
080503 if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.
080504 For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
080505 Now he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.
080506 Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;
080507 for we walk by faith, not by sight.
080508 We are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.
080509 Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him.
080510 For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
080511 Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences.
080512 For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart.
080513 For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God. Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.
080514 For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.
080515 He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.
080516 Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.
080517 Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new.
080518 But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;
080519 namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.
080520 We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
080521 For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
080601 Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,
080602 for he says, "At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you." Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.
080603 We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,
080604 but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,
080605 in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
080606 in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,
080607 in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
080608 by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;
080609 as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;
080610 as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
080611 Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged.
080612 You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.
080613 Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.
080614 Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?
080615 What agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?
080616 What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people."
080617 Therefore, "'Come out from among them, and be separate,' says the Lord. 'Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you.
080618 I will be to you a Father. You will be to me sons and daughters,' says the Lord Almighty."
080701 Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
080702 Open your hearts to us. We wronged no one. We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one.
080703 I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.
080704 Great is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
080705 For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side. Fightings were outside. Fear was inside.
080706 Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
080707 and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more.
080708 For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while.
080709 I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.
080710 For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret. But the sorrow of the world works death.
080711 For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.
080712 So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God.
080713 Therefore we have been comforted. In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.
080714 For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.
080715 His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.
080716 I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.
080801 Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;
080802 how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.
080803 For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,
080804 begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints.
080805 This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.
080806 So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.
080807 But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace.
080808 I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.
080809 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.
080810 I give a judgment in this: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.
080811 But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.
080812 For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don't have.
080813 For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,
080814 but for equality. Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.
080815 As it is written, "He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack."
080816 But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
080817 For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.
080818 We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies.
080819 Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.
080820 We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us.
080821 Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
080822 We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.
080823 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.
080824 Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.
080901 It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,
080902 for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.
080903 But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,
080904 so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.
080905 I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.
080906 Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
080907 Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.
080908 And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.
080909 As it is written, "He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever."
080910 Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;
080911 you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.
080912 For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;
080913 seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;
080914 while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.
080915 Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!
081001 Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you.
081002 Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.
081003 For though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war according to the flesh;
081004 for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,
081005 throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;
081006 and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full.
081007 Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ's, so also we are Christ's.
081008 For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,
081009 that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.
081010 For, "His letters," they say, "are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised."
081011 Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.
081012 For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.
081013 But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you.
081014 For we don't stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn't reach to you. For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ,
081015 not boasting beyond proper limits in other men's labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,
081016 so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done.
081017 But "he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."
081018 For it isn't he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.
081101 I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me.
081102 For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
081103 But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
081104 For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different "good news", which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough.
081105 For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles.
081106 But though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not unskilled in knowledge. No, in every way we have been revealed to you in all things.
081107 Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God's Good News free of charge?
081108 I robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might serve you.
081109 When I was present with you and was in need, I wasn't a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need. In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so.
081110 As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
081111 Why? Because I don't love you? God knows.
081112 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we.
081113 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ's apostles.
081114 And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.
081115 It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.
081116 I say again, let no one think me foolish. But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little.
081117 That which I speak, I don't speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.
081118 Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast.
081119 For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise.
081120 For you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face.
081121 I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.
081122 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.
081123 Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.
081124 Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one.
081125 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck. I have been a night and a day in the deep.
081126 I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;
081127 in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness.
081128 Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the assemblies.
081129 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I don't burn with indignation?
081130 If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.
081131 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I don't lie.
081132 In Damascus the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to arrest me.
081133 Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.
081201 It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
081202 I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don't know, or whether out of the body, I don't know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.
081203 I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don't know; God knows),
081204 how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
081205 On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.
081206 For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.
081207 By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.
081208 Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
081209 He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.
081210 Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.
081211 I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.
081212 Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.
081213 For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.
081214 Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
081215 I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?
081216 But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.
081217 Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?
081218 I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn't we walk in the same spirit? Didn't we walk in the same steps?
081219 Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.
081220 For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don't desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;
081221 that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.
081301 This is the third time I am coming to you. "At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."
081302 I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, I write to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;
081303 seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you.
081304 For he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward you.
081305 Test your own selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves. Or don't you know as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you?--unless indeed you are disqualified.
081306 But I hope that you will know that we aren't disqualified.
081307 Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we are as reprobate.
081308 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
081309 For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting.
081310 For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down.
081311 Finally, brothers, rejoice. Be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.
081312 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
081313 All the saints greet you.
081314 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen.
090101 Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),
090102 and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:
090103 Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
090104 who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father--
090105 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
090106 I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different "good news";
090107 and there isn't another "good news." Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.
090108 But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any "good news" other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.
090109 As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any "good news" other than that which you received, let him be cursed.
090110 For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn't be a servant of Christ.
090111 But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.
090112 For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.
090113 For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.
090114 I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
090115 But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,
090116 to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn't immediately confer with flesh and blood,
090117 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.
090118 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.
090119 But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord's brother.
090120 Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I'm not lying.
090121 Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
090122 I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,
090123 but they only heard: "He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy."
090124 And they glorified God in me.
090201 Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.
090202 I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.
090203 But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
090204 This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;
090205 to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you.
090206 But from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn't show partiality to man)--they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,
090207 but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision
090208 (for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles);
090209 and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.
090210 They only asked us to remember the poor--which very thing I was also zealous to do.
090211 But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned.
090212 For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.
090213 And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.
090214 But when I saw that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, "If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?
090215 "We, being Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,
090216 yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.
090217 But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!
090218 For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.
090219 For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God.
090220 I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.
090221 I don't make void the grace of God. For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!"
090301 Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified?
090302 I just want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
090303 Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?
090304 Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?
090305 He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
090306 Even as Abraham "believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."
090307 Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.
090308 The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you all the nations will be blessed."
090309 So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
090310 For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who doesn't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them."
090311 Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, "The righteous will live by faith."
090312 The law is not of faith, but, "The man who does them will live by them."
090313 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,"
090314 that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
090315 Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.
090316 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn't say, "To seeds," as of many, but as of one, "To your seed," which is Christ.
090317 Now I say this. A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.
090318 For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.
090319 What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
090320 Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.
090321 Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.
090322 But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
090323 But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
090324 So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
090325 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
090326 For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.
090327 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
090328 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
090329 If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.
090401 But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;
090402 but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.
090403 So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.
090404 But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law,
090405 that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children.
090406 And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, "Abba, Father!"
090407 So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
090408 However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods.
090409 But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?
090410 You observe days, months, seasons, and years.
090411 I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.
090412 I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong,
090413 but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.
090414 That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
090415 What was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
090416 So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
090417 They zealously seek you in no good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.
090418 But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.
090419 My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you--
090420 but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
090421 Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don't you listen to the law?
090422 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.
090423 However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.
090424 These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.
090425 For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children.
090426 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
090427 For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren who don't bear. Break forth and shout, you that don't travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband."
090428 Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.
090429 But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.
090430 However what does the Scripture say? "Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman."
090431 So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.
090501 Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.
090502 Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
090503 Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
090504 You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.
090505 For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
090506 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.
090507 You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?
090508 This persuasion is not from him who calls you.
090509 A little yeast grows through the whole lump.
090510 I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.
090511 But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.
090512 I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.
090513 For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.
090514 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
090515 But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don't consume one another.
090516 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh.
090517 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.
090518 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
090519 Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,
090520 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,
090521 envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
090522 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,
090523 gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
090524 Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.
090525 If we live by the Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit.
090526 Let's not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.
090601 Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren't tempted.
090602 Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
090603 For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
090604 But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.
090605 For each man will bear his own burden.
090606 But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.
090607 Don't be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
090608 For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
090609 Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don't give up.
090610 So then, as we have opportunity, let's do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.
090611 See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.
090612 As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
090613 For even they who receive circumcision don't keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
090614 But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
090615 For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
090616 As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God's Israel.
090617 From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.
090618 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
100101 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
100102 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
100103 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;
100104 even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;
100105 having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,
100106 to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved,
100107 in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,
100108 which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
100109 making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
100110 to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;
100111 in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;
100112 to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:
100113 in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation,--in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
100114 who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his glory.
100115 For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,
100116 don't cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
100117 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
100118 having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
100119 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might
100120 which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,
100121 far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.
100122 He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,
100123 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
100201 You were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and sins,
100202 in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience;
100203 among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
100204 But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,
100205 even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),
100206 and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
100207 that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus;
100208 for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,
100209 not of works, that no one would boast.
100210 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them.
100211 Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "uncircumcision" by that which is called "circumcision," (in the flesh, made by hands);
100212 that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
100213 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.
100214 For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,
100215 having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;
100216 and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.
100217 He came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who were near.
100218 For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.
100219 So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
100220 being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone;
100221 in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;
100222 in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.
100301 For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,
100302 if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;
100303 how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,
100304 by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;
100305 which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
100306 that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,
100307 of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.
100308 To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
100309 and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;
100310 to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,
100311 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;
100312 in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
100313 Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.
100314 For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
100315 from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
100316 that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;
100317 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
100318 may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
100319 and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
100320 Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
100321 to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.
100401 I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,
100402 with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love;
100403 being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
100404 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling;
100405 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
100406 one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all.
100407 But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
100408 Therefore he says, "When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men."
100409 Now this, "He ascended," what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?
100410 He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.
100411 He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers;
100412 for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ;
100413 until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;
100414 that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;
100415 but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ;
100416 from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love.
100417 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
100418 being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;
100419 who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
100420 But you did not learn Christ that way;
100421 if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:
100422 that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit;
100423 and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
100424 and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
100425 Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor. For we are members of one another.
100426 "Be angry, and don't sin." Don't let the sun go down on your wrath,
100427 neither give place to the devil.
100428 Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.
100429 Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.
100430 Don't grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
100431 Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice.
100432 And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you.
100501 Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.
100502 Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.
100503 But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;
100504 nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.
100505 Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.
100506 Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.
100507 Therefore don't be partakers with them.
100508 For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,
100509 for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,
100510 proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.
100511 Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.
100512 For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.
100513 But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.
100514 Therefore he says, "Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
100515 Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;
100516 redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
100517 Therefore don't be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
100518 Don't be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,
100519 speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
100520 giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;
100521 subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
100522 Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
100523 For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.
100524 But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.
100525 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;
100526 that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,
100527 that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
100528 Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.
100529 For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;
100530 because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.
100531 "For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh."
100532 This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.
100533 Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
100601 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
100602 "Honor your father and mother," which is the first commandment with a promise:
100603 "that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth."
100604 You fathers, don't provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
100605 Servants, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;
100606 not in the way of service only when eyes are on you, as men pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
100607 with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men;
100608 knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is bound or free.
100609 You masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.
100610 Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.
100611 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
100612 For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
100613 Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.
100614 Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
100615 and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace;
100616 above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.
100617 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the spoken word of God;
100618 with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints:
100619 on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News,
100620 for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
100621 But that you also may know my affairs, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you all things;
100622 whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.
100623 Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
100624 Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love. Amen.
110101 Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ; To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and servants:
110102 Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
110103 I thank my God whenever I remember you,
110104 always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,
110105 for your partnership in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;
110106 being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.
110107 It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.
110108 For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
110109 This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;
110110 so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;
110111 being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
110112 Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;
110113 so that it became evident to the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;
110114 and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.
110115 Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.
110116 The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;
110117 but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.
110118 What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.
110119 For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
110120 according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
110121 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
110122 But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't know what I will choose.
110123 But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
110124 Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
110125 Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,
110126 that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.
110127 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;
110128 and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.
110129 Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,
110130 having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.
110201 If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,
110202 make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
110203 doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;
110204 each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.
110205 Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,
110206 who, existing in the form of God, didn't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,
110207 but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.
110208 And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.
110209 Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;
110210 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,
110211 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
110212 So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
110213 For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
110214 Do all things without murmurings and disputes,
110215 that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,
110216 holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn't run in vain nor labor in vain.
110217 Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.
110218 In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
110219 But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.
110220 For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.
110221 For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
110222 But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.
110223 Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.
110224 But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.
110225 But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need;
110226 since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.
110227 For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.
110228 I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
110229 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,
110230 because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
110301 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome, but for you it is safe.
110302 Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision.
110303 For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;
110304 though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more:
110305 circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;
110306 concerning zeal, persecuting the assembly; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.
110307 However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.
110308 Yes most certainly, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ
110309 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;
110310 that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death;
110311 if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
110312 Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect; but I press on, if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.
110313 Brothers, I don't regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do. Forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,
110314 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
110315 Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you.
110316 Nevertheless, to the extent that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule. Let us be of the same mind.
110317 Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for an example.
110318 For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,
110319 whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.
110320 For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;
110321 who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself.
110401 Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.
110402 I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.
110403 Yes, I beg you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the Good News, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
110404 Rejoice in the Lord always! Again I will say, Rejoice!
110405 Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.
110406 In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
110407 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
110408 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.
110409 The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
110410 But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.
110411 Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.
110412 I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.
110413 I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.
110414 However you did well that you shared in my affliction.
110415 You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.
110416 For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.
110417 Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.
110418 But I have all things, and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.
110419 My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
110420 Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen.
110421 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
110422 All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar's household.
110423 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
120101 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
120102 to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
120103 We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
120104 having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,
120105 because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News,
120106 which has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;
120107 even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,
120108 who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
120109 For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, don't cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
120110 that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
120111 strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;
120112 giving thanks to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;
120113 who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love;
120114 in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins;
120115 who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
120116 For by him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him.
120117 He is before all things, and in him all things are held together.
120118 He is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
120119 For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;
120120 and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross.
120121 You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,
120122 yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him,
120123 if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.
120124 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the assembly;
120125 of which I was made a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of God,
120126 the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints,
120127 to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;
120128 whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;
120129 for which I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.
120201 For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
120202 that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,
120203 in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.
120204 Now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech.
120205 For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
120206 As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him,
120207 rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving.
120208 Be careful that you don't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.
120209 For in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily,
120210 and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power;
120211 in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;
120212 having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
120213 You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,
120214 wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;
120215 having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
120216 Let no one therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,
120217 which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.
120218 Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
120219 and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God's growth.
120220 If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances,
120221 "Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch"
120222 (all of which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?
120223 Which things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but aren't of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.
120301 If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.
120302 Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.
120303 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
120304 When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.
120305 Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
120306 for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.
120307 You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;
120308 but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.
120309 Don't lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,
120310 and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,
120311 where there can't be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.
120312 Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;
120313 bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.
120314 Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.
120315 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.
120316 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.
120317 Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.
120318 Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
120319 Husbands, love your wives, and don't be bitter against them.
120320 Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.
120321 Fathers, don't provoke your children, so that they won't be discouraged.
120322 Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.
120323 And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,
120324 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.
120325 But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.
120401 Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
120402 Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;
120403 praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;
120404 that I may reveal it as I ought to speak.
120405 Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.
120406 Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.
120407 All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord.
120408 I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,
120409 together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you everything that is going on here.
120410 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received commandments, "if he comes to you, receive him"),
120411 and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me.
120412 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
120413 For I testify about him, that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis.
120414 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.
120415 Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house.
120416 When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.
120417 Tell Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."
120418 The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand: remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
130101 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
130102 We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,
130103 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.
130104 We know, brothers loved by God, that you are chosen,
130105 and that our Good News came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake.
130106 You became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,
130107 so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
130108 For from you the word of the Lord has been declared, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say anything.
130109 For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,
130110 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
130201 For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you wasn't in vain,
130202 but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict.
130203 For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception.
130204 But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.
130205 For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),
130206 nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others), when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.
130207 But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.
130208 Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not the Good News of God only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us.
130209 For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail; for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the Good News of God.
130210 You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.
130211 As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you, as a father does his own children,
130212 to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory.
130213 For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.
130214 For you, brothers, became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews;
130215 who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and drove us out, and didn't please God, and are contrary to all men;
130216 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always. But wrath has come on them to the uttermost.
130217 But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,
130218 because we wanted to come to you--indeed, I, Paul, once and again--but Satan hindered us.
130219 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Isn't it even you, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
130220 For you are our glory and our joy.
130301 Therefore, when we couldn't stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone,
130302 and sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the Good News of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;
130303 that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you know that we are appointed to this task.
130304 For most certainly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and you know.
130305 For this cause I also, when I couldn't stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain.
130306 But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long to see you;
130307 for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith.
130308 For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.
130309 For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God;
130310 night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
130311 Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you;
130312 and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you,
130313 to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
130401 Finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, that you abound more and more.
130402 For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
130403 For this is the will of God: your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality,
130404 that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
130405 not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who don't know God;
130406 that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.
130407 For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
130408 Therefore he who rejects this doesn't reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to you.
130409 But concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write to you. For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,
130410 for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound more and more;
130411 and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we instructed you;
130412 that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.
130413 But we don't want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you don't grieve like the rest, who have no hope.
130414 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.
130415 For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.
130416 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,
130417 then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.
130418 Therefore comfort one another with these words.
130501 But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.
130502 For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.
130503 For when they are saying, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.
130504 But you, brothers, aren't in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.
130505 You are all children of light, and children of the day. We don't belong to the night, nor to darkness,
130506 so then let's not sleep, as the rest do, but let's watch and be sober.
130507 For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.
130508 But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
130509 For God didn't appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
130510 who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
130511 Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.
130512 But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,
130513 and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
130514 We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.
130515 See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all.
130516 Rejoice always.
130517 Pray without ceasing.
130518 In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.
130519 Don't quench the Spirit.
130520 Don't despise prophesies.
130521 Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.
130522 Abstain from every form of evil.
130523 May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
130524 He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.
130525 Brothers, pray for us.
130526 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
130527 I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.
130528 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
140101 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:
140102 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
140103 We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers, even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds;
140104 so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.
140105 This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer.
140106 Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,
140107 and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
140108 giving vengeance to those who don't know God, and to those who don't obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,
140109 who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
140110 when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.
140111 To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power;
140112 that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
140201 Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him, we ask you
140202 not to be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, saying that the day of Christ had come.
140203 Let no one deceive you in any way. For it will not be, unless the departure comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction,
140204 he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God.
140205 Don't you remember that, when I was still with you, I told you these things?
140206 Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.
140207 For the mystery of lawlessness already works. Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way.
140208 Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming;
140209 even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
140210 and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost, because they didn't receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
140211 Because of this, God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie;
140212 that they all might be judged who didn't believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
140213 But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth;
140214 to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
140215 So then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word, or by letter.
140216 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
140217 comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.
140301 Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you;
140302 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have faith.
140303 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard you from the evil one.
140304 We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command.
140305 May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
140306 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from us.
140307 For you know how you ought to imitate us. For we didn't behave ourselves rebelliously among you,
140308 neither did we eat bread from anyone's hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you;
140309 not because we don't have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us.
140310 For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: "If anyone will not work, neither let him eat."
140311 For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don't work at all, but are busybodies.
140312 Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
140313 But you, brothers, don't be weary in doing well.
140314 If any man doesn't obey our word in this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.
140315 Don't count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
140316 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.
140317 The greeting of me, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter: this is how I write.
140318 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
150101 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;
150102 to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
150103 As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,
150104 neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God's stewardship, which is in faith--
150105 but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;
150106 from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;
150107 desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.
150108 But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,
150109 as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
150110 for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;
150111 according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
150112 And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;
150113 although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
150114 The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
150115 The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
150116 However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.
150117 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
150118 This instruction I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;
150119 holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;
150120 of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
150201 I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:
150202 for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.
150203 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;
150204 who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.
150205 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
150206 who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;
150207 to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
150208 I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.
150209 In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;
150210 but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.
150211 Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
150212 But I don't permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.
150213 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
150214 Adam wasn't deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;
150215 but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety.
150301 This is a faithful saying: if a man seeks the office of an overseer, he desires a good work.
150302 The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;
150303 not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;
150304 one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;
150305 (but if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the assembly of God?)
150306 not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
150307 Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.
150308 Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;
150309 holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
150310 Let them also first be tested; then let them serve if they are blameless.
150311 Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
150312 Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
150313 For those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
150314 These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;
150315 but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
150316 Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory.
150401 But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,
150402 through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;
150403 forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
150404 For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving.
150405 For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
150406 If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed.
150407 But refuse profane and old wives' fables. Exercise yourself toward godliness.
150408 For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that which is to come.
150409 This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.
150410 For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.
150411 Command and teach these things.
150412 Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.
150413 Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.
150414 Don't neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.
150415 Be diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all.
150416 Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
150501 Don't rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;
150502 the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.
150503 Honor widows who are widows indeed.
150504 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
150505 Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.
150506 But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.
150507 Also command these things, that they may be without reproach.
150508 But if anyone doesn't provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
150509 Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,
150510 being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work.
150511 But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;
150512 having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.
150513 Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.
150514 I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling.
150515 For already some have turned aside after Satan.
150516 If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don't let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.
150517 Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.
150518 For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain." And, "The laborer is worthy of his wages."
150519 Don't receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses.
150520 Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.
150521 I command you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
150522 Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men's sins. Keep yourself pure.
150523 Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities.
150524 Some men's sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.
150525 In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can't be hidden.
150601 Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed.
150602 Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.
150603 If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn't consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,
150604 he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,
150605 constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.
150606 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
150607 For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can't carry anything out.
150608 But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.
150609 But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.
150610 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
150611 But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.
150612 Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.
150613 I command you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,
150614 that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;
150615 which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
150616 who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.
150617 Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;
150618 that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
150619 laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life.
150620 Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;
150621 which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
160101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
160102 to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
160103 I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day
160104 longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;
160105 having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.
160106 For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
160107 For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.
160108 Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,
160109 who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
160110 but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.
160111 For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
160112 For this cause I also suffer these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.
160113 Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
160114 That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
160115 This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
160116 May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,
160117 but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
160118 (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.
160201 You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
160202 The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.
160203 You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
160204 No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
160205 Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules.
160206 The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.
160207 Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.
160208 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,
160209 in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.
160210 Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
160211 This saying is faithful: "For if we died with him, we will also live with him.
160212 If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us.
160213 If we are faithless, he remains faithful. He can't deny himself."
160214 Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.
160215 Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.
160216 But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
160217 and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
160218 men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.
160219 However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."
160220 Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.
160221 If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.
160222 Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
160223 But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.
160224 The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,
160225 in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,
160226 and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.
160301 But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.
160302 For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
160303 without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
160304 traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
160305 holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.
160306 For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,
160307 always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
160308 Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
160309 But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.
160310 But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,
160311 persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.
160312 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
160313 But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
160314 But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.
160315 From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.
160316 Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,
160317 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
160401 I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:
160402 preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.
160403 For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;
160404 and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.
160405 But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.
160406 For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.
160407 I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.
160408 From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.
160409 Be diligent to come to me soon,
160410 for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
160411 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.
160412 But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
160413 Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.
160414 Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,
160415 of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.
160416 At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.
160417 But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
160418 And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
160419 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
160420 Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.
160421 Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.
160422 The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
170101 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
170102 in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie, promised before time began;
170103 but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;
170104 to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
170105 I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;
170106 if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.
170107 For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
170108 but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;
170109 holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.
170110 For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
170111 whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.
170112 One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons."
170113 This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
170114 not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
170115 To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
170116 They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
170201 But say the things which fit sound doctrine,
170202 that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:
170203 and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
170204 that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
170205 to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed.
170206 Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;
170207 in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,
170208 and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.
170209 Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
170210 not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.
170211 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
170212 instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;
170213 looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;
170214 who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.
170215 Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.
170301 Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
170302 to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.
170303 For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
170304 But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,
170305 not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
170306 whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;
170307 that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
170308 This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;
170309 but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
170310 Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;
170311 knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
170312 When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.
170313 Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.
170314 Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
170315 All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
180101 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
180102 to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:
180103 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
180104 I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
180105 hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
180106 that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.
180107 For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
180108 Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,
180109 yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
180110 I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,
180111 who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.
180112 I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
180113 whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.
180114 But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.
180115 For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,
180116 no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
180117 If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
180118 But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.
180119 I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).
180120 Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.
180121 Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.
180122 Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
180123 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
180124 as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
180125 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
190101 God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,
190102 has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds.
190103 His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
190104 having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have.
190105 For to which of the angels did he say at any time, "You are my Son. Today have I become your father?" and again, "I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son?"
190106 Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says, "Let all the angels of God worship him."
190107 Of the angels he says, "Who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire."
190108 But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.
190109 You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows."
190110 And, "You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands.
190111 They will perish, but you continue. They all will grow old like a garment does.
190112 As a mantle, you will roll them up, and they will be changed; but you are the same. Your years will not fail."
190113 But which of the angels has he told at any time, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?"
190114 Aren't they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
190201 Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.
190202 For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;
190203 how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation--which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;
190204 God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?
190205 For he didn't subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.
190206 But one has somewhere testified, saying, "What is man, that you think of him? Or the son of man, that you care for him?
190207 You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor.
190208 You have put all things in subjection under his feet." For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don't see all things subjected to him, yet.
190209 But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.
190210 For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
190211 For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,
190212 saying, "I will declare your name to my brothers. In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise."
190213 Again, "I will put my trust in him." Again, "Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me."
190214 Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
190215 and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
190216 For most certainly, he doesn't give help to angels, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.
190217 Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.
190218 For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
190301 Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;
190302 who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
190303 For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house.
190304 For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.
190305 Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,
190306 but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.
190307 Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, "Today if you will hear his voice,
190308 don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
190309 where your fathers tested me by proving me, and saw my works for forty years.
190310 Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, 'They always err in their heart, but they didn't know my ways;'
190311 as I swore in my wrath, 'They will not enter into my rest.'"
190312 Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;
190313 but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called "today;" lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
190314 For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:
190315 while it is said, "Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion."
190316 For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?
190317 With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
190318 To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
190319 We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
190401 Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.
190402 For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn't profit them, because it wasn't mixed with faith by those who heard.
190403 For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;" although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
190404 For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, "God rested on the seventh day from all his works;"
190405 and in this place again, "They will not enter into my rest."
190406 Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,
190407 he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), "Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts."
190408 For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.
190409 There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
190410 For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.
190411 Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.
190412 For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
190413 There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
190414 Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.
190415 For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.
190416 Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need.
190501 For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
190502 The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.
190503 Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.
190504 Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.
190505 So also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, "You are my Son. Today I have become your father."
190506 As he says also in another place, "You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."
190507 He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,
190508 though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.
190509 Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,
190510 named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
190511 About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.
190512 For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.
190513 For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.
190514 But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.
190601 Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection--not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,
190602 of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
190603 This will we do, if God permits.
190604 For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
190605 and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,
190606 and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.
190607 For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;
190608 but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.
190609 But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.
190610 For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them.
190611 We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,
190612 that you won't be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises.
190613 For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,
190614 saying, "Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you."
190615 Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
190616 For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.
190617 In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;
190618 that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.
190619 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;
190620 where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
190701 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
190702 to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;
190703 without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.
190704 Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils.
190705 They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham,
190706 but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.
190707 But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
190708 Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives.
190709 We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,
190710 for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him.
190711 Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
190712 For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.
190713 For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
190714 For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
190715 This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,
190716 who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:
190717 for it is testified, "You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
190718 For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
190719 (for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
190720 Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath
190721 (for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him, "The Lord swore and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'"
190722 By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant.
190723 Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death.
190724 But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.
190725 Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.
190726 For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
190727 who doesn't need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.
190728 For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected.
190801 Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
190802 a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
190803 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.
190804 For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;
190805 who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, "See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."
190806 But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.
190807 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.
190808 For finding fault with them, he said, "Behold, the days come," says the Lord, "that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
190809 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn't continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them," says the Lord.
190810 "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those days," says the Lord; "I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their heart. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
190811 They will not teach every man his fellow citizen, and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.
190812 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness. I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more."
190813 In that he says, "A new covenant," he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.
190901 Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.
190902 For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place.
190903 After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
190904 having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;
190905 and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can't speak now in detail.
190906 Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,
190907 but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.
190908 The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;
190909 which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;
190910 being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.
190911 But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
190912 nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.
190913 For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:
190914 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
190915 For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
190916 For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.
190917 For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.
190918 Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.
190919 For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
190920 saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you."
190921 Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the blood.
190922 According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.
190923 It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
190924 For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;
190925 nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,
190926 or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
190927 Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,
190928 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.
191001 For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.
191002 Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?
191003 But in those sacrifices there is yearly reminder of sins.
191004 For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
191005 Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, "Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire, but you prepared a body for me;
191006 You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
191007 Then I said, 'Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.'"
191008 Previously saying, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn't desire, neither had pleasure in them" (those which are offered according to the law),
191009 then he has said, "Behold, I have come to do your will." He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,
191010 by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
191011 Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,
191012 but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;
191013 from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.
191014 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
191015 The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
191016 "This is the covenant that I will make with them: 'After those days,' says the Lord, 'I will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;'" then he says,
191017 "I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more."
191018 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
191019 Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
191020 by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
191021 and having a great priest over the house of God,
191022 let's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,
191023 let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful.
191024 Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,
191025 not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching.
191026 For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,
191027 but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.
191028 A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses.
191029 How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
191030 For we know him who said, "Vengeance belongs to me," says the Lord, "I will repay." Again, "The Lord will judge his people."
191031 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
191032 But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;
191033 partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so.
191034 For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens.
191035 Therefore don't throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.
191036 For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.
191037 "In a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait.
191038 But the righteous will live by faith. If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him."
191039 But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.
191101 Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen.
191102 For by this, the elders obtained testimony.
191103 By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible.
191104 By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks.
191105 By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn't see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God.
191106 Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.
191107 By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
191108 By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went.
191109 By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.
191110 For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
191111 By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised.
191112 Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.
191113 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
191114 For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
191115 If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return.
191116 But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
191117 By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son;
191118 even he to whom it was said, "In Isaac will your seed be called;"
191119 concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.
191120 By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.
191121 By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.
191122 By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones.
191123 By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
191124 By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
191125 choosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;
191126 accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.
191127 By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
191128 By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.
191129 By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.
191130 By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.
191131 By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn't perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.
191132 What more shall I say? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;
191133 who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
191134 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee.
191135 Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
191136 Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment.
191137 They were stoned. They were sawn apart. They were tempted. They were slain with the sword. They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
191138 (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.
191139 These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn't receive the promise,
191140 God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
191201 Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
191202 looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
191203 For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don't grow weary, fainting in your souls.
191204 You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;
191205 and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children, "My son, don't take lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him;
191206 For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives."
191207 It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn't discipline?
191208 But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children.
191209 Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
191210 For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.
191211 All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.
191212 Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,
191213 and make straight paths for your feet, so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.
191214 Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,
191215 looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;
191216 lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.
191217 For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.
191218 For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,
191219 the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,
191220 for they could not stand that which was commanded, "If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned;"
191221 and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."
191222 But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,
191223 to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,
191224 to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.
191225 See that you don't refuse him who speaks. For if they didn't escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,
191226 whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."
191227 This phrase, "Yet once more," signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
191228 Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can't be shaken, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,
191229 for our God is a consuming fire.
191301 Let brotherly love continue.
191302 Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing it.
191303 Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.
191304 Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled: but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.
191305 Be free from the love of money, content with such things as you have, for he has said, "I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way forsake you."
191306 So that with good courage we say, "The Lord is my helper. I will not fear. What can man do to me?"
191307 Remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God, and considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith.
191308 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
191309 Don't be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.
191310 We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat.
191311 For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp.
191312 Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.
191313 Let us therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach.
191314 For we don't have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to come.
191315 Through him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name.
191316 But don't forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
191317 Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you.
191318 Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.
191319 I strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you sooner.
191320 Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,
191321 make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
191322 But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.
191323 Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.
191324 Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. The Italians greet you.
191325 Grace be with you all. Amen.
200101 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings.
200102 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations,
200103 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
200104 Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
200105 But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him.
200106 But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.
200107 For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.
200108 He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
200109 But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position;
200110 and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.
200111 For the sun arises with the scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits.
200112 Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.
200113 Let no man say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God," for God can't be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.
200114 But each one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.
200115 Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death.
200116 Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers.
200117 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow.
200118 Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
200119 So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;
200120 for the anger of man doesn't produce the righteousness of God.
200121 Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
200122 But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.
200123 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;
200124 for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.
200125 But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets, but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.
200126 If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man's religion is worthless.
200127 Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
200201 My brothers, don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.
200202 For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in;
200203 and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, "Sit here in a good place;" and you tell the poor man, "Stand there," or "Sit by my footstool;"
200204 haven't you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
200205 Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?
200206 But you have dishonored the poor man. Don't the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?
200207 Don't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
200208 However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well.
200209 But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
200210 For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.
200211 For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not commit murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
200212 So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.
200213 For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
200214 What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?
200215 And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,
200216 and one of you tells them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled;" and yet you didn't give them the things the body needs, what good is it?
200217 Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.
200218 Yes, a man will say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith.
200219 You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.
200220 But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?
200221 Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
200222 You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;
200223 and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness;" and he was called the friend of God.
200224 You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.
200225 In like manner wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?
200226 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
200301 Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.
200302 For in many things we all stumble. If anyone doesn't stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.
200303 Indeed, we put bits into the horses' mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.
200304 Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.
200305 So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!
200306 And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.
200307 For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.
200308 But nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
200309 With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.
200310 Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
200311 Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?
200312 Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.
200313 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.
200314 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don't boast and don't lie against the truth.
200315 This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.
200316 For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.
200317 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
200318 Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
200401 Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don't they come from your pleasures that war in your members?
200402 You lust, and don't have. You kill, covet, and can't obtain. You fight and make war. You don't have, because you don't ask.
200403 You ask, and don't receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.
200404 You adulterers and adulteresses, don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
200405 Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously"?
200406 But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
200407 Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
200408 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
200409 Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.
200410 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
200411 Don't speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
200412 Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?
200413 Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow let's go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit."
200414 Whereas you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.
200415 For you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that."
200416 But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.
200417 To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn't do it, to him it is sin.
200501 Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you.
200502 Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten.
200503 Your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days.
200504 Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies.
200505 You have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.
200506 You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous one. He doesn't resist you.
200507 Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain.
200508 You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
200509 Don't grumble, brothers, against one another, so that you won't be judged. Behold, the judge stands at the door.
200510 Take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
200511 Behold, we call them blessed who endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the Lord in the outcome, and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
200512 But above all things, my brothers, don't swear, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your "yes" be "yes," and your "no," "no;" so that you don't fall into hypocrisy.
200513 Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praises.
200514 Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord,
200515 and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
200516 Confess your offenses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective.
200517 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it didn't rain on the earth for three years and six months.
200518 He prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.
200519 Brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back,
200520 let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.
210101 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
210102 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
210103 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
210104 to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn't fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,
210105 who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
210106 Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,
210107 that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ--
210108 whom not having known you love; in whom, though now you don't see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory--
210109 receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
210110 Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,
210111 searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them.
210112 To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.
210113 Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ--
210114 as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,
210115 but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;
210116 because it is written, "You shall be holy; for I am holy."
210117 If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear:
210118 knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,
210119 but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Christ;
210120 who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,
210121 who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.
210122 Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from the heart fervently:
210123 having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and remains forever.
210124 For, "All flesh is like grass, and all of man's glory like the flower in the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls;
210125 but the Lord's word endures forever." This is the word of Good News which was preached to you.
210201 Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,
210202 as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,
210203 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:
210204 coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.
210205 You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
210206 Because it is contained in Scripture, "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious: He who believes in him will not be disappointed."
210207 For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who are disobedient, "The stone which the builders rejected, has become the chief cornerstone,"
210208 and, "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense." For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.
210209 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:
210210 who in time past were no people, but now are God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
210211 Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
210212 having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.
210213 Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme;
210214 or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well.
210215 For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
210216 as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.
210217 Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
210218 Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.
210219 For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.
210220 For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.
210221 For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps,
210222 who did not sin, "neither was deceit found in his mouth."
210223 Who, when he was cursed, didn't curse back. When he suffered, didn't threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;
210224 who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.
210225 For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
210301 In like manner, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; so that, even if any don't obey the Word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word;
210302 seeing your pure behavior in fear.
210303 Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;
210304 but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God very precious.
210305 For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:
210306 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.
210307 You husbands, in like manner, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be hindered.
210308 Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous,
210309 not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but instead blessing; knowing that to this were you called, that you may inherit a blessing.
210310 For, "He who would love life, and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.
210311 Let him turn away from evil, and do good. Let him seek peace, and pursue it.
210312 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
210313 Now who is he who will harm you, if you become imitators of that which is good?
210314 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. "Don't fear what they fear, neither be troubled."
210315 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear:
210316 having a good conscience; that, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good manner of life in Christ.
210317 For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil.
210318 Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
210319 in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,
210320 who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.
210321 This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you--not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
210322 who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.
210401 Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;
210402 that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
210403 For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.
210404 They think it is strange that you don't run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming:
210405 who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
210406 For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit.
210407 But the end of all things is near. Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.
210408 And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.
210409 Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.
210410 As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms.
210411 If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
210412 Beloved, don't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you.
210413 But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy.
210414 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.
210415 For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men's matters.
210416 But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter.
210417 For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who don't obey the Good News of God?
210418 "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?"
210419 Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.
210501 I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.
210502 Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;
210503 neither as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.
210504 When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn't fade away.
210505 Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
210506 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;
210507 casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.
210508 Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
210509 Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.
210510 But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.
210511 To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
210512 Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
210513 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.
210514 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
220101 Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:
220102 Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
220103 seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue;
220104 by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.
220105 Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge;
220106 and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness;
220107 and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love.
220108 For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
220109 For he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.
220110 Therefore, brothers, be more diligent to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never stumble.
220111 For thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
220112 Therefore I will not be negligent to remind you of these things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth.
220113 I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you;
220114 knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
220115 Yes, I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure.
220116 For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
220117 For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
220118 We heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
220119 We have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well that you heed it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star arises in your hearts:
220120 knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.
220121 For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
220201 But false prophets also arose among the people, as false teachers will also be among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.
220202 Many will follow their immoral ways, and as a result, the way of the truth will be maligned.
220203 In covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words: whose sentence now from of old doesn't linger, and their destruction will not slumber.
220204 For if God didn't spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;
220205 and didn't spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;
220206 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly;
220207 and delivered righteous Lot, who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked
220208 (for that righteous man dwelling among them, was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless deeds):
220209 the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment;
220210 but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries;
220211 whereas angels, though greater in might and power, don't bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.
220212 But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,
220213 receiving the wages of unrighteousness; people who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you;
220214 having eyes full of adultery, and who can't cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing;
220215 forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrongdoing;
220216 but he was rebuked for his own disobedience. A mute donkey spoke with a man's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet.
220217 These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.
220218 For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error;
220219 promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him.
220220 For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
220221 For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
220222 But it has happened to them according to the true proverb, "The dog turns to his own vomit again," and "the sow that has washed to wallowing in the mire."
220301 This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you;
220302 that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior:
220303 knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come, walking after their own lusts,
220304 and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming? For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
220305 For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water, by the word of God;
220306 by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.
220307 But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
220308 But don't forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
220309 The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but is patient with us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
220310 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.
220311 Therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this, what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness,
220312 looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?
220313 But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
220314 Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things, be diligent to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless in his sight.
220315 Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you;
220316 as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things. In those, there are some things that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
220317 You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware, lest being carried away with the error of the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness.
220318 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.
230101 That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life
230102 (and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);
230103 that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
230104 And we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled.
230105 This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
230106 If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't tell the truth.
230107 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
230108 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
230109 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
230110 If we say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
230201 My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have a Counselor with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.
230202 And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
230203 This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments.
230204 One who says, "I know him," and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn't in him.
230205 But whoever keeps his word, God's love has most certainly been perfected in him. This is how we know that we are in him:
230206 he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.
230207 Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.
230208 Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.
230209 He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.
230210 He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.
230211 But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
230212 I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
230213 I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.
230214 I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
230215 Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't in him.
230216 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, but is the world's.
230217 The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever.
230218 Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour.
230219 They went out from us, but they didn't belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us.
230220 You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all have knowledge.
230221 I have not written to you because you don't know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
230222 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.
230223 Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.
230224 Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father.
230225 This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life.
230226 These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray.
230227 As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you don't need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him.
230228 Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
230229 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him.
230301 Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesn't know us, because it didn't know him.
230302 Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. But we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.
230303 Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.
230304 Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness.
230305 You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.
230306 Whoever remains in him doesn't sin. Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.
230307 Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
230308 He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
230309 Whoever is born of God doesn't commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can't sin, because he is born of God.
230310 In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn't do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn't love his brother.
230311 For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;
230312 unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
230313 Don't be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.
230314 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn't love his brother remains in death.
230315 Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.
230316 By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
230317 But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him?
230318 My little children, let's not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.
230319 And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,
230320 because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
230321 Beloved, if our hearts don't condemn us, we have boldness toward God;
230322 and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
230323 This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded.
230324 He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
230401 Beloved, don't believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
230402 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,
230403 and every spirit who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God, and this is the spirit of the Antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the world already.
230404 You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.
230405 They are of the world. Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
230406 We are of God. He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn't listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
230407 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.
230408 He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love.
230409 By this God's love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
230410 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
230411 Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.
230412 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.
230413 By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
230414 We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.
230415 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.
230416 We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.
230417 In this love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world.
230418 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is not made perfect in love.
230419 We love him, because he first loved us.
230420 If a man says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
230421 This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother.
230501 Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him.
230502 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.
230503 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.
230504 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: your faith.
230505 Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
230506 This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
230507 For there are three who testify:
230508 the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one.
230509 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony which he has testified concerning his Son.
230510 He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who doesn't believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.
230511 The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
230512 He who has the Son has the life. He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life.
230513 These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.
230514 This is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.
230515 And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
230516 If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death. I don't say that he should make a request concerning this.
230517 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.
230518 We know that whoever is born of God doesn't sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn't touch him.
230519 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
230520 We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
230521 Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
240101 The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;
240102 for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:
240103 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
240104 I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.
240105 Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
240106 This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
240107 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.
240108 Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.
240109 Whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.
240110 If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't receive him into your house, and don't welcome him,
240111 for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.
240112 Having many things to write to you, I don't want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.
240113 The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
250101 The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.
250102 Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers.
250103 For I rejoiced greatly, when brothers came and testified about your truth, even as you walk in truth.
250104 I have no greater joy than this, to hear about my children walking in truth.
250105 Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers.
250106 They have testified about your love before the assembly. You will do well to send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God,
250107 because for the sake of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
250108 We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
250109 I wrote to the assembly, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, doesn't accept what we say.
250110 Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words. Not content with this, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws out of the assembly.
250111 Beloved, don't imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God. He who does evil hasn't seen God.
250112 Demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.
250113 I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen;
250114 but I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
260101 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:
260102 Mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.
260103 Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I was constrained to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.
260104 For there are certain men who crept in secretly, even those who were long ago written about for this condemnation: ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into indecency, and denying our only Master, God, and Lord, Jesus Christ.
260105 Now I desire to remind you, though you already know this, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who didn't believe.
260106 Angels who didn't keep their first domain, but deserted their own dwelling place, he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day.
260107 Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, having, in the same way as these, given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
260108 Yet in like manner these also in their dreaming defile the flesh, despise authority, and slander celestial beings.
260109 But Michael, the archangel, when contending with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation, but said, "May the Lord rebuke you!"
260110 But these speak evil of whatever things they don't know. What they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, they are destroyed in these things.
260111 Woe to them! For they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in Korah's rebellion.
260112 These are hidden rocky reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
260113 wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.
260114 About these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,
260115 to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
260116 These are murmurers and complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaks proud things), showing respect of persons to gain advantage.
260117 But you, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
260118 They said to you that "In the last time there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts."
260119 These are they who cause divisions, and are sensual, not having the Spirit.
260120 But you, beloved, keep building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.
260121 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.
260122 On some have compassion, making a distinction,
260123 and some save, snatching them out of the fire with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the flesh.
260124 Now to him who is able to keep them from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy,
260125 to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.
270101 This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, John,
270102 who testified to God's word, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw.
270103 Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is at hand.
270104 John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from God, who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;
270105 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and washed us from our sins by his blood;
270106 and he made us to be a Kingdom, priests to his God and Father; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
270107 Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, including those who pierced him. All the tribes of the earth will mourn over him. Even so, Amen.
270108 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."
270109 I John, your brother and partner with you in oppression, Kingdom, and perseverance in Christ Jesus, was on the isle that is called Patmos because of God's Word and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
270110 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet
270111 saying, "What you see, write in a book and send to the seven assemblies: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
270112 I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. Having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.
270113 And among the lampstands was one like a son of man, clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.
270114 His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.
270115 His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.
270116 He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.
270117 When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He laid his right hand on me, saying, "Don't be afraid. I am the first and the last,
270118 and the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. I have the keys of Death and of Hades.
270119 Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;
270120 the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies. The seven lampstands are seven assemblies.
270201 "To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write: "He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks among the seven golden lampstands says these things:
270202 "I know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that you can't tolerate evil men, and have tested those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and found them false.
270203 You have perseverance and have endured for my name's sake, and have not grown weary.
270204 But I have this against you, that you left your first love.
270205 Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I am coming to you swiftly, and will move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.
270206 But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
270207 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of my God.
270208 "To the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write: "The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life says these things:
270209 "I know your works, oppression, and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
270210 Don't be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.
270211 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He who overcomes won't be harmed by the second death.
270212 "To the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write: "He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things:
270213 "I know your works and where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn't deny my faith in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
270214 But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.
270215 So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans likewise.
270216 Repent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.
270217 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.
270218 "To the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write: "The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things:
270219 "I know your works, your love, faith, service, patient endurance, and that your last works are more than the first.
270220 But I have this against you, that you tolerate your woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
270221 I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.
270222 Behold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent of her works.
270223 I will kill her children with Death, and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.
270224 But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as don't have this teaching, who don't know what some call 'the deep things of Satan,' to you I say, I am not putting any other burden on you.
270225 Nevertheless, hold that which you have firmly until I come.
270226 He who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end, to him I will give authority over the nations.
270227 He will rule them with a rod of iron, shattering them like clay pots; as I also have received of my Father:
270228 and I will give him the morning star.
270229 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
270301 "And to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write: "He who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars says these things: "I know your works, that you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
270302 Wake up, and keep the things that remain, which you were about to throw away, for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God.
270303 Remember therefore how you have received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If therefore you won't watch, I will come as a thief, and you won't know what hour I will come upon you.
270304 Nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments. They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
270305 He who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments, and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
270306 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
270307 "To the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write: "He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one opens, says these things:
270308 "I know your works (behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one can shut), that you have a little power, and kept my word, and didn't deny my name.
270309 Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but lie. Behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.
270310 Because you kept my command to endure, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, which is to come on the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
270311 I am coming quickly! Hold firmly that which you have, so that no one takes your crown.
270312 He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will go out from there no more. I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name.
270313 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
270314 "To the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write: "The Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Head of God's creation, says these things:
270315 "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot.
270316 So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of my mouth.
270317 Because you say, 'I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing;' and don't know that you are the wretched one, miserable, poor, blind, and naked;
270318 I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.
270319 As many as I love, I reprove and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent.
270320 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me.
270321 He who overcomes, I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne.
270322 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies."
270401 After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, "Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this."
270402 Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne
270403 that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.
270404 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.
270405 Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
270406 Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
270407 The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.
270408 The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!"
270409 When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,
270410 the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,
270411 "Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One, to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created!"
270501 I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.
270502 I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?"
270503 No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it.
270504 And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look in it.
270505 One of the elders said to me, "Don't weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals."
270506 I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.
270507 Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
270508 Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
270509 They sang a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the book, and to open its seals: for you were killed, and bought us for God with your blood, out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,
270510 and made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign on earth."
270511 I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;
270512 saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!"
270513 I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, "To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen!"
270514 The four living creatures said, "Amen!" The elders fell down and worshiped.
270601 I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, "Come and see!"
270602 And behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him, and he came forth conquering, and to conquer.
270603 When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come!"
270604 Another came forth, a red horse. To him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword.
270605 When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, "Come and see!" And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.
270606 I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don't damage the oil and the wine!"
270607 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, "Come and see!"
270608 And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it, his name was Death. Hades followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him.
270609 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony of the Lamb which they had.
270610 They cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"
270611 A long white robe was given to each of them. They were told that they should rest yet for a while, until their fellow servants and their brothers, who would also be killed even as they were, should complete their course.
270612 I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.
270613 The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.
270614 The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
270615 The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.
270616 They told the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,
270617 for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?"
270701 After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.
270702 I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,
270703 saying, "Don't harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!"
270704 I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:
270705 of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
270706 of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
270707 of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
270708 of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
270709 After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.
270710 They cried with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
270711 All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his throne, and worshiped God,
270712 saying, "Amen! Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might, be to our God forever and ever! Amen."
270713 One of the elders answered, saying to me, "These who are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and from where did they come?"
270714 I told him, "My lord, you know." He said to me, "These are those who came out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb's blood.
270715 Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them.
270716 They will never be hungry, neither thirsty any more; neither will the sun beat on them, nor any heat;
270717 for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them, and leads them to springs of waters of life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
270801 When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
270802 I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
270803 Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.
270804 The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.
270805 The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.
270806 The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
270807 The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
270808 The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,
270809 and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed.
270810 The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.
270811 The name of the star is called "Wormwood." One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
270812 The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn't shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.
270813 I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!"
270901 The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.
270902 He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.
270903 Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
270904 They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don't have God's seal on their foreheads.
270905 They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a person.
270906 In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.
270907 The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people's faces.
270908 They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.
270909 They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.
270910 They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.
270911 They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon," but in Greek, he has the name "Apollyon."
270912 The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.
270913 The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,
270914 saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, "Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!"
270915 The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind.
270916 The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million. I heard the number of them.
270917 Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.
270918 By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.
270919 For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.
270920 The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn't repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn't worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.
270921 They didn't repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.
271001 I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.
271002 He had in his hand a little open book. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land.
271003 He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
271004 When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and don't write them."
271005 The angel who I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky,
271006 and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be delay,
271007 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants, the prophets.
271008 The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me, said, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land."
271009 I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. He said to me, "Take it, and eat it up. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."
271010 I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
271011 They told me, "You must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
271101 A reed like a rod was given to me. Someone said, "Rise, and measure God's temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.
271102 Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don't measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.
271103 I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."
271104 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing before the Lord of the earth.
271105 If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way.
271106 These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.
271107 When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.
271108 Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
271109 From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.
271110 Those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they will be glad. They will give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
271111 After the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them.
271112 I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here!" They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.
271113 In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
271114 The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe comes quickly.
271115 The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven followed, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!"
271116 The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God's throne, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
271117 saying: "We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was; because you have taken your great power, and reigned.
271118 The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their reward, as well as to the saints, and those who fear your name, to the small and the great; and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
271119 God's temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of the Lord's covenant was seen in his temple. Lightnings, sounds, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail followed.
271201 A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
271202 She was with child. She cried out in pain, laboring to give birth.
271203 Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.
271204 His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.
271205 She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.
271206 The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days.
271207 There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war.
271208 They didn't prevail, neither was a place found for him any more in heaven.
271209 The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
271210 I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now is come the salvation, the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night.
271211 They overcame him because of the Lamb's blood, and because of the word of their testimony. They didn't love their life, even to death.
271212 Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time."
271213 When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.
271214 Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
271215 The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.
271216 The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.
271217 The dragon grew angry with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep God's commandments and hold Jesus' testimony.
271301 Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names.
271302 The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.
271303 One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast.
271304 They worshiped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"
271305 A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority to make war for forty-two months was given to him.
271306 He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven.
271307 It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him.
271308 All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed.
271309 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
271310 If anyone has captivity, he will go into captivity. If anyone is with the sword, he must be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
271311 I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.
271312 He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.
271313 He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people.
271314 He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived.
271315 It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast to be killed.
271316 He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands, or on their foreheads;
271317 and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
271318 Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six.
271401 I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.
271402 I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.
271403 They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.
271404 These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.
271405 In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.
271406 I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
271407 He said with a loud voice, "Fear the Lord, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!"
271408 Another, a second angel, followed, saying, "Babylon the great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality."
271409 Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand,
271410 he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.
271411 The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.
271412 Here is the patience of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
271413 I heard the voice from heaven saying, "Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'" "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them."
271414 I looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
271415 Another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, "Send forth your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!"
271416 He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
271417 Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven. He also had a sharp sickle.
271418 Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Send forth your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth's grapes are fully ripe!"
271419 The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
271420 The winepress was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out from the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.
271501 I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God's wrath is finished.
271502 I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who overcame the beast, his image, and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God.
271503 They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God, the Almighty! Righteous and true are your ways, you King of the nations.
271504 Who wouldn't fear you, Lord, and glorify your name? For you only are holy. For all the nations will come and worship before you. For your righteous acts have been revealed."
271505 After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.
271506 The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out, clothed with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes around their breasts.
271507 One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
271508 The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power. No one was able to enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished.
271601 I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!"
271602 The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast, and who worshiped his image.
271603 The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died.
271604 The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.
271605 I heard the angel of the waters saying, "You are righteous, who are and who were, you Holy One, because you have judged these things.
271606 For they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve this."
271607 I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments."
271608 The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire.
271609 People were scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues. They didn't repent and give him glory.
271610 The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,
271611 and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores. They didn't repent of their works.
271612 The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrise.
271613 I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;
271614 for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of that great day of God, the Almighty.
271615 "Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothes, so that he doesn't walk naked, and they see his shame."
271616 He gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew, Megiddo.
271617 The seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
271618 There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.
271619 The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
271620 Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
271621 Great hailstones, about the weight of a talent, came down out of the sky on people. People blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for this plague is exceedingly severe.
271701 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,
271702 with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality."
271703 He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
271704 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth.
271705 And on her forehead a name was written, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
271706 I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.
271707 The angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
271708 The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction. Those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is not, and shall be present.
271709 Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.
271710 They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little while.
271711 The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.
271712 The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.
271713 These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
271714 These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. They also will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful."
271715 He said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.
271716 The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and will make her desolate, and will make her naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.
271717 For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.
271718 The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth."
271801 After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of the sky, having great authority. The earth was illuminated with his glory.
271802 He cried with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons, a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird!
271803 For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury."
271804 I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, that you have no participation in her sins, and that you don't receive of her plagues,
271805 for her sins have reached to the sky, and God has remembered her iniquities.
271806 Return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she did, and according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to her double.
271807 However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, 'I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way see mourning.'
271808 Therefore in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong.
271809 The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her, will weep and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of her burning,
271810 standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For your judgment has come in one hour.'
271811 The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise any more;
271812 merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory, every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;
271813 and cinnamon, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, and people's bodies and souls.
271814 The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you will find them no more at all.
271815 The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;
271816 saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls!
271817 For in an hour such great riches are made desolate.' Every shipmaster, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away,
271818 and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What is like the great city?'
271819 They cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!' For in one hour is she made desolate.
271820 "Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her."
271821 A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all.
271822 The voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. No craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you.
271823 The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived.
271824 In her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on the earth."
271901 After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation, power, and glory belong to our God:
271902 for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has judged the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand."
271903 A second said, "Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever."
271904 The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen! Hallelujah!"
271905 A voice came forth from the throne, saying, "Give praise to our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great!"
271906 I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!
271907 Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give the glory to him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready."
271908 It was given to her that she would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
271909 He said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'" He said to me, "These are true words of God."
271910 I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me, "Look! Don't do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy."
271911 I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and makes war.
271912 His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has names written and a name written which no one knows but he himself.
271913 He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood. His name is called "The Word of God."
271914 The armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in white, pure, fine linen.
271915 Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged sword, that with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.
271916 He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
271917 I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, "Come! Be gathered together to the great supper of God,
271918 that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, and small and great."
271919 I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army.
271920 The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
271921 The rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse, the sword which came forth out of his mouth. All the birds were filled with their flesh.
272001 I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
272002 He seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole inhabited earth, and bound him for a thousand years,
272003 and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were finished. After this, he must be freed for a short time.
272004 I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as didn't worship the beast nor his image, and didn't receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They lived, and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
272005 The rest of the dead didn't live until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
272006 Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over these, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him one thousand years.
272007 And after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison,
272008 and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
272009 They went up over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven from God, and devoured them.
272010 The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
272011 I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. There was found no place for them.
272012 I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.
272013 The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one according to his works.
272014 Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
272015 If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
272101 I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more.
272102 I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband.
272103 I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, "Behold, God's dwelling is with people, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.
272104 He will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more. The first things have passed away."
272105 He who sits on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." He said, "Write, for these words of God are faithful and true."
272106 He said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life.
272107 He who overcomes, I will give him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.
272108 But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death."
272109 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the wife, the Lamb's bride."
272110 He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
272111 having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it was a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
272112 having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
272113 On the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
272114 The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.
272115 He who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.
272116 The city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth. He measured the city with the reed, Twelve thousand twelve stadia. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.
272117 Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.
272118 The construction of its wall was jasper. The city was pure gold, like pure glass.
272119 The foundations of the city's wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
272120 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst.
272121 The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
272122 I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple.
272123 The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
272124 The nations will walk in its light. The kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
272125 Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be no night there),
272126 and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter.
272127 There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.
272201 He showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,
272202 in the middle of its street. On this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
272203 There will be no curse any more. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants serve him.
272204 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
272205 There will be no night, and they need no lamp light; for the Lord God will illuminate them. They will reign forever and ever.
272206 He said to me, "These words are faithful and true. The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bondservants the things which must happen soon."
272207 "Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book."
272208 Now I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things.
272209 He said to me, "See you don't do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers, the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God."
272210 He said to me, "Don't seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand.
272211 He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still. He who is filthy, let him be filthy still. He who is righteous, let him do righteousness still. He who is holy, let him be holy still."
272212 "Behold, I come quickly. My reward is with me, to repay to each man according to his work.
272213 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
272214 Blessed are those who do his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.
272215 Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
272216 I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies. I am the root and the offspring of David; the Bright and Morning Star."
272217 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" He who hears, let him say, "Come!" He who is thirsty, let him come. He who desires, let him take the water of life freely.
272218 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone adds to them, may God add to him the plagues which are written in this book.
272219 If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, may God take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
272220 He who testifies these things says, "Yes, I come quickly." Amen! Yes, come, Lord Jesus.
272221 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints. Amen.
