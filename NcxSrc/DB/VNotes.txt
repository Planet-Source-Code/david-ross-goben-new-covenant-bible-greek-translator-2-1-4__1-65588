130415 The Double-Negative "Not No" (Greek {ou mh}) is used in this verse. Though some may read this as "Nay, no" or "Nay, not", double-negatives were common devices used before, during, and after the Gospel period, confusing the uninitiated.  Though sometimes these would not "appear" to make sense except as negatives, very profound meaning can be derived from a deep philosophical standpoint.
130415 Change "we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep", to, "we who are still alive, who are left till the presence of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep".
130415 and others: Terms whose meanings have changed: "For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep."  To the average reader, this passage says that those who are alive at Christ's return will not stop (prevent), or hinder those who are dead from meeting the Lord. (This assumes, of course,  that the average reader knows that "asleep" means to be dead.)  However, "prevent," in the 17th Century, meant to "precede."  Paul is telling the Thessalonians that those who are alive will not "precede" those who are dead, at Christ's return.  See also Ps. 88:13, 119:147, Amos 9:10.
130503 The Double-Negative "Not No" (Greek {ou mh}) is used in this verse. Though some may read this as "Nay, no" or "Nay, not", double-negatives were common devices used before, during, and after the Gospel period, confusing the uninitiated.  Though sometimes these would not "appear" to make sense except as negatives, very profound meaning can be derived from a deep philosophical standpoint.

140207 and others: Terms whose meanings have changed: "For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way."  Without entering into an interpretation of this passage, it seems to be saying that "he who allows will continue to allow, until he is taken out of the way."  However, in the 17th Century, "let" meant to "restrain".  This should read:  "For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way."
140208 Add "Jesus" after "Lord".
140208 Read "shall slay" instead of "shall consume".

150104 Read "a dispensation of God" instead of "godly edifying".
150104 The KJV: "..which minister questions, rather then edifying.."  Modern KJV:  "..which minister questions, rather than godly edifying.."  The modern KJV is more accurate than the 1611, but even that is not the best translation.  A better version is: "These promote mere speculation [or "controversy"]* rather than God's work [or "the administration of God"]**, which is by faith." (Gk. {ejkzhthvsei}: useless speculation; {oijkonomivan qeou}: a stewardship of God)

150209 Read "and gold" instead of "or gold".
150209 The KJV had "shamefastness."  The modern KJV has  "Shamefacedness," which was a printer's correction.   Both terms mean the same thing, but a better translation would be "modesty" or "decency" (Gk. {aijou}).

272125 The Double-Negative "Not No" (Greek {ou mh}) is used in this verse. Though some may read this as "Nay, no" or "Nay, not", double-negatives were common devices used before, during, and after the Gospel period, confusing the uninitiated.  Though sometimes these would not "appear" to make sense except as negatives, very profound meaning can be derived from a deep philosophical standpoint.

272215 Transpose "loveth and maketh" to "maketh and loveth".
272216 Read "in the churches" instead of "over the churches" (KJV "in the churches").
272216 Read "the bright, the morning star" instead of "the bright and morning star".
272216 Term taken from Vugate Latin, not from Greek: "... the bright and morning star." The term for "morning star" ({ojrqrinov}) appears in none of the Greek manuscripts.
272217 Omit "And" before "whosoever will, let him take".
272217 Term taken from Vugate Latin, not from Greek: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.  And let him that heareth say, Come.  And let him that is athirst come… "  Both of the Greek terms for "come," and the term for "let him… come," do not appear in any of the Greek manuscripts.  However, this is of no practical importance since the terms that are in the Greek ({jjjejrcou} and {ejrcevsqw}, respectively) carry the same meaning.
272218 Omit "For" at beginning of verse.
272218 Read "them" instead of "these things".
272218 Read "may God add" instead of "God shall add".
272218 Term taken from Vugate Latin, not from Greek: "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book… "  The italicized words are to be found in no Greek manuscript.  However, as in the preceding example, the meaning is not materially altered by the terms that are in the Greek.
272219 Read "may God take away" instead of "God shall take away".
272219 Read "from the tree of life" instead of "out of the book of life".
272219 Omit "out of" before "the holy city".
272219 Omit "and [from]" before "the things which are written".
272219 Term taken from Vugate Latin, not from Greek: "..book of life.."  In fact, the Greek has "..tree of life.."        (Gk. {xuvlou th zwh})
272219 Term taken from Vugate Latin, not from Greek: "And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Again, the italicized terms are those that appear in none of the Greek manuscripts.  As with the preceding two examples, the correct Greek terms mean pretty much the same things–with the exception of the term "book," in the "book of life" (in bold letters).  This should read, "tree of life."  There is not a single Greek manuscript that supports the KJV reading.
272220 Omit "Even so" after "Amen".
272220 Read "and" instead of "Even so".
272221 Omit "our" and render "the Lord".

272221 Read "with all the saints" instead of "with you all".
272221 Read "with all" instead of "with you all".
272221 Omit "Amen" at end of verse.
272221 Term taken from Vugate Latin, not from Greek: This should read, "The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all," not "...be with you all."  Again, a minor variation, but the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the KJV does contain errors which can be clearly demonstrated.  It is a good translation, but there are better.
010119 KJV wording: to make her a publick example - corrected wording: to make a public spectacle of her - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text) Mat 1:19 - KJV wording: to put her away privily - modern translation: to break the engagement <or divorce> without publicly bringing charges against her (or: to break the engagement "without a public trial and without statement of the cause" - Newman and Stine, A Handbook on the Gospel of Matthew, NY: United Bible Societies, 1988, page 23). The Greek word {apoluo}, which is variously translated in Mat 1:19 as 'put away' (KJV), 'dismiss' (NRSV), 'break the engagement' (TEV), is exactly the same word translated as "divorced" in Mat 5:32. That same word {apoluo} is translated in the KJV as "put away" in Mat 5:31,32; Mat 19:7-9, Mar 10:2,4,11,12; Luk 16:18; all of which refer to divorce. From the Middle East to Southeast Asia, many culture have treated and still treat a marriage engagement as seriously and as binding as the actual marriage itself. Breaking an engagement would require divorce procedures just as breaking the marriage itself would. The minimum number of witnesses to a divorce was two, which would have been considered very private, in relative terms. A charge of adultery during engagement would subject an engaged person to a sentence of death by stoning. (See Deu 22:20,21.). Willoughby C. Allen (The International Critical Commentary: The Gospel according to St. Matthew, Third Edition, Edinburgh: T&T Clark, no date, page 9) writes: "According to Jewish law, a betrothed woman was already the wife of her betrothed husband;... Mary's condition seemed to make the fulfilment of their contract of marriage impossible for a religious man... On the other hand, he [Joseph] did not wish to expose her to shame... Appeal to the courts for a divorce would expose Mary to public ignominy, and make her liable to severe penalties. Refusal to carry out the contract of marriage would leave her and her child in disgrace in the house of her parents. The latter seemed the more merciful course, and Joseph determined, therefore, to repudiate her by private arrangement."
010123 KJV wording: virgin - translation from OT Hebrew: young woman of marriageable age or newly married young woman - translation from NT Greek: virgin or unmarried girl.
010223 The Most difficult verse in the passage is the very last, v. 23. 'He will be called a Nazorean' does not appear in the OT. Yet Matthew refers to 'the prophets' being fufilled... Matthew contains an involved wordplay. The LXX interchanges 'holy one of God' -- an early Christian title for Jesus (Mk 1:24; Lk 4:34; Jn 6:69) -- and 'nazarite' (cf. Judg 13:7; 16:17). This matters because if we make that substitution in Isa 4:3 MT ('will be called holy'), the result is very near v. 23. Further, in Acts 24:5 Christians are 'the sect of the Nazarenes'... It is likely that members of the Matthean community referred to themselfves not as 'Christians' (a term missing from this gospel) but as 'Nazoreans'. Certainly that would have given v. 23 an even greater impact: Jesus followers bear the name that he bore.

010216 (and verses 17 and 18) slaughter of male children - several different views. Robert J. Miller (The Complete Gospels, NY: HarperSanFrancisco: 1994, page 61) comments: Historians are unable to find any evidence of the murder of the children. W.F. Albright and C.S. Mann (Matthew [The Anchor Bible], Doubleday: Garden City, NY: 1971, page 19) comment: The slaughter of infants two years old or less in a town of the size of Bethlehem (population ca. 300) at this time would not only have been a comparatively minor incident, and so probably unknown to Josephus, but also completely in line with Herod's known character. The evangelist sees the episode as yet another facet of Israel's whole spiritual experience, summed up in Jesus, and seen against the context of Jer xxxi. Robert W. Funk and The Jesus Seminar (The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do? NY: HarperSanFrancisco, 1998, page 509) comment: The murder of the babies and the flight to Egypt represent the persecution of a potential royal rival by a reigning king. This is a constant feature in hellenistic biographies of heroes and in tales of royal succession the world over: a king attempts to kill or exile successors to protect his own position. Matthew's story is borrowed specifically from the account of Moses' birth in Exodus (1:1-2:10): the Pharaoh orders the midwives to destroy all male children born to Hebrew women because the Hebrews are multiplying and thriving; when the midwives fail to heed the Pharaoh's order, he commands that all male babies be thrown into the Nile and drowned. Once again, Matthew's story is designed to go with the prophetic text, in this case one from Jeremiah. Although Herod the Great was capable of slaughtering babies wholesale (he had three of his own sons put to death and he wanted his soldiers to execute notable political prisoners at the time of his death to make sure that everyone mourned his passing), the incident Matthew relates is undoubtedly a fiction. Benedict T. Viviano (The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, edited by Raymond E. Brown, Joseph A. Fitzmyer, & Roland E. Murphy, Englewood Cliffs, NY: Prentice Hall, 1990, page 636) comments: Herod acts in character; the story may not be historical but possesses verisimilitude and is reminiscent of Pharaoh's command to kill the male offspring of the Israelites (Exod 1:16), a classic example of genocidal abuse of power. If the incident is historical, the number of children killed need not have exceeded 20.

The NRSV and TEV interpretted "Jesus" into the text, even though "Jesus" was not specified in the Greek text they used for the translation. The more literal New American Bible (NAB), Revised Standard Version (RSV), and other modern versions correctly translated "he" in this verse, because "Jesus" was not specified in the Greek text they used for the translation.

Newman and Nida, A Translator's Handbook on the Acts of the Apostles, NY: United Bible Societies, 1972, page 122: "In biblical terminology "evil spirits" and "unclean spirits" are essentially synonymous. There are, however, serious difficulties encountered in employing an adjective such as "unclean," for this can turn out to be simply "dirty." Quite naturally the emphasis in the Bible is on the fact that these spirits caused people to become unclean in a religious sense, that is, they defiled them, so that they could not worship God.""

011247 The strength of manuscript evidence is about equally balanced as to whether this verse was or was not in the original text. The NRSV retains the verse without using brackets, and the ESV omits the verse from its text but includes it in a footnote on the same page. Both positions have strong support from early ancient manuscripts. Below is a comparison of the ESV with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] (which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses): ESV - 47; NRSV - 47 Someone told him, "Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."; NAB - 47 (Someone told him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, asking to speak with you."); Bruce Metzger (TCGNT p. 26) writes: The sentence, which seems to be necessary for the sense of the following verses, apparently was accidentally omitted because of homoeoteleuton (lalesai ... lalesai). In view, however, of the age and weight of the diverse text-types [including Aleph and B] that omit the words, the Committee enclosed the words within square brackets in order to indicate a certain amount of doubt concerning their right to stand in the text.

011351 The 2 verses (51-52) and verses 36-50 are found only in the canonical gospels in Matthew. (The 3 parables in this section are also found in the Gospel of Thomas, though in slightly different forms.) The interpretative sections (verses 36-43 and 51-52) likely either (1) came from special gospel sources that only Matthew had or (2) were part of Matthew's creative adaptation of his material to the needs of his community. It is also worth pointing out that of the 64 times that scribe (Greek: grammateus; English: writer or teacher of the law) is used in the New Testament, this is the only instance where scribe is used of a believer, a member of the Christian community. The Five Gospels (by Robert W. Funk, Roy W. Hoover, and The Jesus Seminar, NY: HarperCollins, 1993, p. 198) comments: "Trained scholar. This saying has probably been composed by Matthew as the conclusion to his collection of parables. For Matthew, scholars schooled in Heaven's imperial rule will understand the parables in much the same way that the disciples respond in this exchange. The toastmaster at a banquet produces both mature and young wine from a large cellar (drawing images and stories, old and new, from a large repertoire and then explaining what they mean for those present). This is the way Jesus tells and explains parables, according to Matthew." The Good News according to Matthew (by Eduard Schweizer, translated by David E. Green, Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1975, pp. 314-315) comments: "[51] Matthew's conclusion is instructive. Everything depends on "understanding"... [52] Matthew obviously sees the disciples as prototypes of the teacher of the Law who becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of heaven... According to Ecclesiasticus 39:3, the teacher of the Law is one who "explores the hidden meaning of cryptic discourses and occupies himself with the riddles of parables." Perhaps Matthew means that "therefore" -- because you have understood -- there can now be teachers of the Law like that." By means of a metaphor he emphasizes what concerned him in 5:17-48. The true teacher of the Law has learned from Jesus to see both the old and the new together (cf. Wisd. 8.8) -- God's Law, and its new interpretation proclaimed by Jesus and realized in all that he does. Or is Matthew thinking of Jesus' own teaching, and its new interpretation in the "learned" decisions of the community of disciples (16:19; 18:18)? In either case, it is clear that for Matthew the whole collection of parables is a didactic discourse on the Kingdom of God. Such a teacher of the Law is of course no longer a "rabbi," i.e. a "great one," but rather a "disciple" in the Kingdom of heaven, i.e. one who remains a "learner" (the same word in Greek [as disciple]) throughout his life (cf. 23:10).

011511 KJV wording: DEFILES A MAN - alternative translation: makes a man ritually unclean [Newman and Nida, A Translator's Handbook on the Acts of the Apostles, NY: United Bible Societies, 1972, page 122, write: In biblical terminology "evil spirits" and "unclean spirits" are essentially synonymous. There are, however, serious difficulties encountered in employing an adjective such as "unclean," for this can turn out to be simply "dirty." Quite naturally the emphasis in the Bible is on the fact that these spirits caused people to become unclean in a religious sense, that is, they defiled them, so that they could not worship God."].
011514 Gr: {tuphloi eisin hodegoi [tuphlon]} With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text.

011916 (immediately before "Master") omit KJV wording:GOOD - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). Though not in the original Greek text of Mat 19:16, "Good Master" was in the original Greek text of this account in both Mar 10:17 and Luk 18:18.

011929 Omit KJV wording: or wife - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). Note: Not only was "or wife" not in the original texts of Mat 19:29, but also the KJV's (and Textus Receptus') teaching to 'leave wife' to follow Jesus, is clearly a misrepresentation of Jesus' genuine teachings as found in the gospels and as witnessed in Paul's letter to the Corinthians (1 Co 7:10-16). The Greek words translated "or wife" were in the Textus Receptus Greek text that the KJV translators used in their 1611 translation of the Bible; however, these words ("or wife") were added to the Greek texts of Mar 10:29 and Mat 19:28 by a later copiest. This is further attested by the fact that these words "or wife" do not appear in similar passages in the Gospel According to Thomas (Thomas 55:1,2, and Thomas 101:1-3. Though the Gospel According to Thomas is not part of the generally accepted canonical writings of Christians, it does provide another very early witness to some of Jesus' sayings.) "Or wife" has so little manuscript support in Mar 10:29 that it is not even mentioned in the extensive footnotes of the United Bible Society's definitive Greek New Testament, Fourth Revised Edition (1994) or in Bruce Metzger's A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Second Edition (1993). Regarding Mat 19:29, Metzger comments (TCGNT p. 40): "The presence of {gunaika} [wife] in many witnesses seems to be the result of scribal assimilation to the Lukan parallel (Lk 18:29). According to Mat 19:27, Mar 10:28, and Luk 18:28, Peter "left all" to follow Christ Jesus. By implication, "all" would include those houses and people listed in Mat 19:28, Mar 10:29, and Luk 18:29. According to the synoptic gospels (Mat 8:14; Mar 1:30; Luk 4:38) and according Paul (1Co 9:5), Peter continued to be married and to take his wife with him when he traveled, so "wife" clearly was not included in the "all" that Christians were expected to leave behind in their spiritual (or human) journey.

012716 (and verse 17) Gr: {[epi tous huiouV teV appeitheiaV]}. Manuscript evidence is very strong in support of the absence of this wording [English: Jesus, immediately before Barabbas] in the original text. The NRSV retains the wording, and the ESV omits it from both the text and the footnotes. The ESV's position has very strong support from early ancient manuscripts. Below is a comparison of the ESV with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] (which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses): ESV - 16 And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. 17 So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?" NRSV - 16 At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Jesus Barabbas. 17 So after they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?" NAB - 16 And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called (Jesus) Barabbas. 17 So when they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Which one do you want me to release to you, (Jesus) Barabbas, or Jesus called Messiah?" Bruce Metzger (TCGNT p. 56) writes: "The reading preserved today in several Greek manuscripts and early versions was known to Origen [180-255 A.D.], who declares in his commentary on the passage, "In many copies it is not stated that Barabbas was also called Jesus, and perhaps [the omission is] right." (Origen discloses in what follows his reason for disapproving of the reading Jesus Barabbas; it cannot be right, he implies, because "in the whole range of scripture we know that no one who is a sinner [is called] Jesus.")..." A majority of the Committee was of the opinion that the original text of Matthew had the double name in both verses and that Iesoun [Jesus] was deliberately suppressed in most witnesses for reverential considerations. In view of the relatively slender external support for Iesoun [Jesus], however, it was deemed fitting to enclose the word within square brackets.

ESV - 40 and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." NRSV - 40 and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."

021029 omit KJV wording: or <2228> wife <1135> - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). Note: Not only was "or wife" not in the original texts of Mar 10:29, but also the KJV's (and Textus Receptus') teaching to 'leave wife' to follow Jesus, is clearly a misrepresentation of Jesus' genuine teachings as found in the gospels and as witnessed in Paul's letter to the Corinthians (1 Co 7:10-16). The Greek words translated "or wife" were in the Textus Receptus Greek text that the KJV translators used in their 1611 translation of the Bible; however, these words ("or wife") were added to the Greek texts of Mar 10:29 and Mat 19:29 by a later copiest. This is further attested by the fact that these words "or wife" do not appear in similar passages in the Gospel According to Thomas (Thomas 55:1,2, and Thomas 101:1-3. Though the Gospel According to Thomas is not part of the generally accepted canonical writings of Christians, it does provide another very early witness to some of Jesus' sayings.) "Or wife" has so little manuscript support that it is not even mentioned in the extensive footnotes of the United Bible Society's definitive Greek New Testament, Fourth Revised Edition (1994) or in Bruce Metzger's A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Second Edition (1993). According to Mat 19:27, Mar 10:28, and Luk 18:28, Peter "left all" to follow Christ Jesus. By implication, "all" would include those houses and people listed in Mat 19:29, Mar 10:29, and Luk 18:29. According to the synoptic gospels (Mat 8:14; Mar 1:30; Luk 4:38) and according Paul (1Co 9:5), Peter continued to be married and to take his wife with him when he traveled, so "wife" clearly was not included in the "all" that Christians were expected to leave behind in their spiritual (or human) journey.

030128 omit KJV wording: blessed art thou among women - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). The United Bible Society's definitive Greek New Testament reads Luk 1:28 as follows: "{Kai} <and> {eiselthon} <having gone in> {pros} <to> {auten} <her> {eipen} <he said>, {chaire} <Greetings, or Be full of joy>, {kecharitomene} <one having been favored>, {ho} <the> {kurioV} <Lord> {meta} <with> {sou} <you>." The NRSV correctly reads: "And he came to her and said, "Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you." It is only the King James Version and other less accurate (and generally older) versions that have the errors in Luk 1:28. They are based upon the so-called Textus Receptus.

030214 KJV wording: good will toward men - corrected wording: to men of [God's] good purpose - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). In accordance with the original Greek text, this change reflects a correction of the errant 16th century Greek text from which the KJV was translated. Bruce Metzger (A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Second Edition, New York: United Bible Societies, 1994, page 111) comments: "The difference between the AV [KJV], "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men," and the RSV, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!" is not merely a matter of exegesis of the meaning of the Greek, but is first of all one of text criticism. Does the Angelic Hymn close with eudokia [nominative] or eudokias [genitive]? The genitive case, which is the more difficult reading, is supported by the oldest representatives of the Alexandrian and the Western groups of witnesses. The rise of the nominative reading can be explained either as an amelioration of the sense or as a palaeographical oversight... The meaning seems to be, not that divine peace can be bestowed only where human good will is already present, but that at the birth of the Saviour God's peace rests on those whom he has chosen in accord with his good pleasure..."

Bruce Metzger (A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Second Edition, New York: United Bible Societies, 1994, page 112) comments: "In the interest of safeguarding the doctrine of the virgin birth a few copyists and translators replaced hoi goneis autou [his parents] with the proper names ho te Ioseph kai he Mariam [Joseph and Mary]."

030249 KJV wording: ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS - corrected translation: in my Father's house - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's translation). Greek: {en toiV tou patroV mou}. Literally: "in the things of my Father" NAB, NIV, NJB, NRSV, REB, RSV, RV, TEV: "in my Father's house". The Interpreter's Bible, Volume 8 (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1952, page 68) comments: "About my Father's business cannot be dismissed as an impossible translation, but the RSV alternative in my Father's house is more appropriate after an implied interrogative of place. The early church believed that Jesus stood in a unique relationship to God, and that occasionally he made use of an address to the deity in which this was implied. In an unobtrusive way the christological reflection has left its impress on Luke's story. In his first recorded utterance Jesus spoke of God as "my Father" in a sense that distinguished this relationship from one that was open to all, and his parents did not understand the saying." Jesus and the New Age According to St. Luke: A Commentary on the Third Gospel (by Frederick W. Danker, St. Louis: Clayton Publishing, 1972, page 40) comments: "Jesus asks his parents: How is it that you sought me? The words echo the language about the search at vs. 44. There is good reason for addressing this and the next question to both parents. They must learn to live with the fact that he, their son, is a stranger and a guest in their house, for he is under orders from Another. I must be in my Father's house. The Greek syntax is ambiguous, and Luke may have intended a double entente: 'In my Father's house' or 'with my Father.' The RSV, however renders correctly a common Greek idiom, and there is no doubt where the emphasis lies." The Expositor's Greek Testament, Volumes I, (edited by W. Robertson Nicoll (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, reprinted 1979, page 479) comments: "{en poiV tou patroV mou}, in the things of my Father ("about my Father's business," A.V.); therefore in the place or house of my Father (R.V.); the former [in the things of my Father] may be the verbal translation, but the latter [in the place or house of my Father] is the real meaning Jesus wished to suggest. In this latter rendering patristic and modern interpreters in the main concur."

The KJV division of these two verses is different from the standardly accepted division of verses. Based upon the TR the KJV puts "and John calling unto him two of his disciples" in Luk 7:19 rather than in Luk 7:18, which is where it is standardly placed. The only discrepancy here is with the division of the verses, not with the text itself.

031001 KJV, NASB, NRSV wording: seventy - NIV, NJB, REB wording: seventy-two - NAB, UBS4 (Greek New Testament) wording: seventy[-two]. Bruce Metzger, in A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Second Edition (New York: United Bible Societies, 1994, pages 126-127), writes: "Was it seventy or seventy-two whom Jesus appointed and sent on ahead of him? The external evidence is almost evenly divided... The factors that bear on the evaluation of internal evidence are singularly elusive... In order to represent the balace of external evidence and the indecisiveness of internal consideration, a majority of the Committee decided to include the word duo in the text, but to enclose it within square brackets to indicate a certain doubt that it has a right to stand there." Fellow Greek New Testament Editorial Committee member and textual authority Kurt Aland is granted a dissenting opinion in the Metzger's Textual Commentary from the indecisiveness of the rest of the Editorial Committee. Unequivocally endorsing "seventy-two" as representing the original text of Luke, Aland writes: "The concept of "70" is an established entity in the Septuagint and in Christian tradition... Consequently it is astonishing that the reading hebdomeykonta duo [seventy-two] occurs at all in 10.1 and 17, and that it has such strong support."

031307 Gr: {ekkopson [oun]}. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text. The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 7 And he said to the vinedresser, 'Look, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why should it use up the ground?' NRSV - So he said to the gardener, 'See here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?' NAB - 7 he said to the gardener, 'For three years now I have come in search of fruit on this fig tree but have found none. (So) cut it down. Why should it exhaust the soil?'

031520 (and verses 22 and 23) kiss, robe, ring, shoes, meat: Joachim Jeremias (The Parables of Jesus, p. 130) describes the message conveyed by these. kiss: In this circumstance a kiss was a symbol of forgiveness. robe: It was a designation of honor for a guest to receive a gift of a ceremonial robe. The father now considered the wayward son as a guest of honor. ring: The ring symbolized that the son was being given authority. shoes: Since shoes were a luxury and warn only by freemen, they symbolized that the son was no longer a poor slave, who went barefoot. meat: Since eating any kind of meat indicated a special occasion, preparing the fatted calf represented an extraordinary event.

031824 not part of Jesus' original teaching: or wife. Note: OR WIFE did not appear in the original Greek texts of similar passages in Mar 10:29 or Mat 19:29. Mark was written 10 to 25 years before Matthew's or Luke's gospel, and Mark's account of these verses was the basis for both Matthew's and Luke's account. The writer of Luke clearly added "or wife" to the source material he had. The Greek words translated "or wife" were in the KJV translators' Greek text (Textus Receptus) of Matthew, Mark, and Luke; however, these words ("or wife") were were not in the original Greek text of Mark or Matthew. A later copyist of the Greek text added those words to the text of Mar 10:29 and Mat 19:29. That the teaching to 'leave wife' is a misrepresentation of Jesus' genuine teachings is consistently attested in the gospels, in Paul's letter to the Corinthians (1 Co 7:10-16), and in similar passages in the Gospel According to Thomas (Tho 55). "Or wife" in Mar 10:29 and Mat 19:29 has so little manuscript support that it is not even mentioned in the extensive footnotes of the United Bible Society's definitive Greek New Testament, Fourth Revised Edition (1994) or in Bruce Metzger's A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Second Edition (1993). According to Mat 19:27, Mar 10:28, and Luk 18:28, Peter "left all" to follow Christ Jesus. By implication, "all" would include those houses and people listed in Mat 19:29, Mar 10:29, and Luk 18:29. According to the synoptic gospels (Mat 8:14; Mar 1:30; Luk 4:38) and according Paul (1Co 9:5), Peter continued to be married and to take his wife with him when he traveled, so "wife" clearly was not included in the "all" that Christians were expected to leave behind in their spiritual (or human) journey. Though the following verses refer to someone who divorces a spouse and later remarries, they do show the emphasis that Jesus places on the permanence of the marriage commitment. A man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against his wife. In the same way, a woman who divorces her husband and marries another man commits adultery. (Mar 10:11,12, TEV) If a man divorces his wife, for any cause other than her unfaithfulness, then he is guilty of making her commit adultery if she marries again; and the man who marries her commits adultery also. (Mat 5:32, TEV) Any man who divorces his wife for any cause other than her unfaithfulness, commits adultery if he marries some other woman." (Mat 19:9, TEV) Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery; and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. (Luk 16:18, TEV) (See also 1Co 7:10-16.).

032334 text missing in many important early manuscripts: "then Jesus said, Father, forgive them; they know not what they do". Though this text was in the 16th century Greek text from which the KJV was translated, this text is missing in many important early manuscripts. Some scholars believe that the text was in the original text; even those who believe that it was not in the original text still believe that the text represents an original tradition about Jesus at his crucifixion. The textual commentaries below are representative of a variety of highly qualified scholarly conclusions on the subject. They appear in the reverse chronological order of the date of publication of the resource. The prayer of Jesus is omitted by Codex Vaticanus, Codex Bezae, and other important manuscripts, but it is well attested in other manuscripts, and most modern textual critics accept it as a genuine part of the text. It could be taken to refer either to the Roman soldiers or to all those responsible for the crucifixion. In the light of Acts 3:17, 19; 7:59f. it is probable that the sentence stood in the original text of Luke and that Luke himself took it to refer to the Jews. It has been suggested that the prayer may have been excised from an early copy of the Gospel by a second-century scribe who thought it incredible that God should pardon the Jews and, in view of the double destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 and 135, certain that he had not in fact done so.

In accordance with the original Greek text, this change reflects a correction of the errant 16th century Greek text from which the KJV was translated.
032452 The phrase, "worshipped him, and," is not found in a number of ancient manuscripts. It was left out of the Revised Standard Version (RSV), because a majority of the RSV's translation committee in 1952 concluded that that phrase was not in the original text. By the end of the century, only a minority of the United Bible Society's (UBS) Greek New Testament Committee held that view. Bruce Metzger (A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Second Edition, New York: United Bible Societies, 1994, page 111), who was on the RSV translation committee, chaired the NRSV translation committee, and has been on the UBS Greek New Testament Committee since its start, comments: "Although a minority of the Committee preferred the shorter reading, regarding the others as interpolations (see the Note following 24.53), the majority considered it more probable that the words {proskunesanteV auton} [worshipped him] had been omitted (the eye of the copyist passing from {agtoi} ... to {agton}) or, perhaps deliberately (so as to accord better with the shorter reading in ver. 51; see the concluding comments on the previous variant reading)."

040142 KJV wording: Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone - modern translation: Cephas, which is translated Peter. J.H. Bernard (The International Critical Commentary: The Gospel according to St. John, Volume I, Edinburgh: T&T Clark, no date, page 60) comments: "The Aramaic name Kephas... is familiar in Paul, who uses it to designate Simon always in 1 Cor. (1:12, 3:22, 9:5, 15:5) and generally in Gal. (1:18, 2:9,11,14; but cf. 2:7,8). It appears in no other Gospel but Jn., and the retention of the Aramaic Kepha is a touch that could hardly have occured to any one whose mother speech was not Aramaic... By the end of the first century Simon was best known as Petros, and he has been generally called by this name ever since." Raymond Brown (The Anchor Bible: The Gospel according to John, Volume 1, New York: Doubleday, 1966, page 76) comments: "Only John among the Gospels give the Greek transliteration of Peter's Aramaic name Kepha, or, perhaps, in Galilean Aramaic Qepha... Matt xvi 18 supposes the Aramaic substratum but does not express it (the play on "Peter" and "rock" is not good in Greek where the former is Petros [masculine] and the latter is petra [feminine]; it is perfect in Aramaic where both are kepha). Neither Petros in Greek nor Kepha in Aramiac is a normal proper name; rather it is a nickname (like American "Rocky" which would have to be explained by something in Simon's character or career." Barclay M. Newman and Eugene A. Nida (A Translator's Handbook on the Gospel of John, New York: United Bible Societies, 1980, page 45) comments: "The Greek word Petros renders the Aramic kepa, the Greek form of which Kephas, appears in this verse. This information can be conveyed by translating literally and providing a foodnote, as in the RSV. However it seems preferable to follow the technique of the TEV or NEB, which make this information explicit in the text: "Your name will be Cephas. (This is the same as Peter and means 'a rock.')..." In a different context, Paul used the Greek word petra (Strong's #4073) when he wrote (1Co 10:4): The rock was Christ.

052804 omit KJV wording: venomous - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). There is no basis for "venomous" in any Greek text, including in the Greek text used by the KJV translators. The translators may have assumed that the snake was "venomous," because it was described as hanging, which they assumed to be "hanging by venomous fangs." As to what type of snake it was, the text does not tell us, nor does the text tell us whether the snake was poisonous. Commentators generally point out that there are no poisonous snakes native to Malta. Most assume that the snake was a Coronella Austriaka, which is native to Malta. That type of snake bites through and does cling to its victim, but it is not poisonous.

The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 19 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. NRSV - 19 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was already as good as dead (for he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. NAB - 9 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body as (already) dead (for he was almost a hundred years old) and the dead womb of Sarah.

060819 KJV wording: creature - modern translation: creation.
060820 (and verse 21) KJV wording: "in hope, because" - corrected wording: ", in hope that". "In hope" is the beginning of a prepositional clause that begins in Rom 8:20 and continues in Rom 8:21. Unfortunately, the KJV punctuates these verses poorly. The comma should precede "in hope" rather than follow it. And the Greek word {hoti} should be translated "that" instead of "because". This was a case where the KJV translators had the correct Greek text, but the translators themselves apparently did not understand the meaning. (When reading from the KJV, one should feel free to change the punctuation to reflect the originally intended meaning.) The original 1611 edition of the KJV read exactly as follows: "20 For the creature was made subiect to vanitie, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subiected the same in hope: 21 Because the creature it selfe also shall bee deliuered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious libertie of the children of God." (There are no typographical errors in the above quote. The 1611 KJV used different spelling and punctuation than our current versions of the KJV. In some cases it also used different words than our several current versions of the KJV.) The TEV translates these two verses: "[20] For creation was condemned to lose its purpose, not of its own will, but because God willed it to be so. [See Gen 3:17-19] Yet there was the hope [21] that creation itself would one day be set free from its slavery to decay and would share the glorious freedom of the children of God." The NRSV translates these two verses: "[20] for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope [21] that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God." Regarding this passage, the Harper's Bible Commentary (Edited by James Luther Mays, New York: Harper and Row, Publishers, Inc., 1988) writes, "The world’s futility and 'decay' (i.e., its vulnerability to the ravages of time), two of its most characteristic marks to Hellenistic thinking, are not the result of anything it has done; there is no 'fall' of creation. Rather, they are part of the created order and fall under God’s own 'expectation that the creation itself will be set free' to share in the glorious liberty of God’s children (Rom. 8:20-21), so bearing their own testimony to God’s transcending future."

Bruce Metzger (Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Second Edition, New York: United Bible Socieities, 1994, pages 463-464) explains the need for this correction in the KJV, the New Testament of which is based upon the less-than-always-reliable Textus Receptus: "Instead of Christou [of Christ], which is strongly supported by early and diverse witnesses..., the Textus Receptus... reads Theou [of God]..."

071303 KJV and other translations' similar wording: and if I deliver my body to be burned - NRSV's wording and NAB's similar wording: and if I hand over my body so that I may boast. There is divided scholarly opinion regarding what was the original Greek text of this verse. The weight of manuscript evidence supports the NRSV translation of this verse as follows: "If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing." This was also the basic reading in Rotherham's Bible (which was begun in 1868 and completed in 1902) and in the Twentieth Century New Testament (which was begun in 1898, completed in 1901, and first published as a single volume in 1904). The only other recent translation that uses the NRSV's reading is the New American Bible, which is itself a consistently excellent translation. The NRSV's reading is based upon the conclusion of the Editorial Committee of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament. On the basis of that committee's review of all available manuscripts, it edits and publishes the definitive Greek New Testament. Bruce Metzger, who is a member of that committee and who chaired the New Revised Standard translation committee, commented on this verse in his definitive Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament.

081004 correct KJV verse division wording - move: casting down imaginations from: 2Co 10:5 to: the end of 2Co 10:4. The KJV division of these two verses is different from the standardly accepted division of verses. Based upon the TR the KJV puts "casting down imaginations" is in 2Co 10:5 rather than in 2Co 10:4, which is where it is standardly placed. The only discrepancy here is with the division of the verses, not with the text itself.

090115 Gr: {eudokesen [ho theos]}. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text. The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 15 But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, NRSV - 15 But when God, who had set me apart before I was born and called me through his grace, was pleased, NAB - 15 But when (God), who from my mother's womb had set me apart and called me through his grace, was pleased.

110320 KJV wording: conversation <Greek: {politeuma}> - corrected translation: commonwealth (or: citizenship). Interestingly, in the 20 instances throughout the Bible where the KJV uses the word "conversation," the original Hebrew and Greek words have nothing to do with verbal communication. In all but Phi 1:27 and 3:20, the correct biblical translation is "behavior" or "way of life." In Phi 1:27 and 3:20 the Greek word translated as "conversation" in the KJV is politeuma, which means "commonwealth," "citizenship," "enfranchisement," or "community." (Politeuma has the same root as the English "politics.") The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology, Volume 2 (edited by Colin Brown, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1976, pag 804) states the following: "{politeuma} occurs only at Phil. 3:20 where Paul contrasts the Christian life-style with that of the "enemies of the cross of Christ" (3:18): "But our commonwealth [{politeuma}] is in heaven, and from it we await our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ" (RSV). The older translation" citizenship" (RV) stresses the status of the believers, whereas "conversation (AV [KJV]), i.e. way of life, has affinities with the vb. {politeuomai}... M. Dibelius suggests "colony"... But the meaning is more likely to be that of "capital or native city, which keeps the citizens on its registers"... The second half of the verse requires a place to be meant here, in order to make sense of the remark "and from it we await". Moreover, "the background of the word in this context, is the situation related to the capital city of Rome."... As Roman subjects, the Phillipian Christians owed an allegiance to the far off capital city of Rome. At the same time, they had "another king, one Jesus" (Acts 17:7). Hence, on earth they are resident aliens who dwell temporarily in a foreign country but who have their capital and homeland elsewhere (cf. 1 Pet. 1:1; 2:11; Jas. 1:1; Heb. 11:13; Ep. Diog. 5).

120124 KJV wording: BEHIND: lacking.
120202 omit KJV wording: AND OF THE FATHER, AND.
120216 KJV wording: MEAT - modern translation: eating, consuming, the act of eating; meal, food, meat. The NRSV and most other modern translations consistently translate the Greek word {brosis} as "food" (see Mat 6:19,20; Joh 4:32; 6:27,55; Rom 14:17; 1Co 8:4; 2Co 9:10; and Col 2:16) except in Heb 12:16, where they translates it as "meal." Biblical Greek lexicons translate {brosis} as both "eating" and "food."
120302 KJV wording: set your affection on things above - modern translation: think on the things above (or: mind the things above). The single Greek verb, {phroneite}, translated "set your affection on" or "think", is exactly the same Greek verb that is translated as the two words "Let...mind" in Phi 2:5. The full sentence in the KJV of Phi 2:5 reads, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." Phi 2:5 is literally translated from the Greek, "Think within you this which also was within Christ Jesus."
120304 KJV wording: "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory." Corrected wording that appears in other Bible versions: "So when Christ our life is manifested, then also you will be manifested in rectification with him." Rotherham: "As soon as ||the Christ|| shall be made manifest -- ||Our life||> ||Then|| ||ye also|| |together with him| shall be made manifest in glory;" RV, ASV, Weymouth: "When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory."
120306 Gr: [{epi tous huious tes appeitheias}]. The strength of manuscript evidence is about equally balanced as to whether this wording [English: on those who are disobedient] was or was not in the original text. The NRSV retains the wording, and the ESV omits it. Both positions have strong support from early ancient manuscripts. Below is a comparison of the ESV with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] (which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses): ESV - 6 On account of these the wrath of God is coming. NRSV - 6 On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient. NAB - 6 Because of these the wrath of God is coming (upon the disobedient).

130313 Gr: {auto [amen]}. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text.

ESV - 13 so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. NRSV - 13 And may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

191101 KJV wording: substance - modern translation: underlying reality (or: assurance). Regarding the Greek word translated in the KJV as "substance," which is translated in the RSV as "assurance," Paul Ellingworth and Eugene A. Nida write in Handbook on The Letter to the Hebrews, (New York: United Bible Societies, 1983, page 251): The Greek word which RSV translates "assurance" has been understood in three ways: (a) From early times, some translators and commentators have thought it had the meaning "substance" or"underlying reality" which it has in 1.3 (God's own being). This interpretation is chosen by KJV "substance"; Knox and NEB text "gives substance to our hopes." (b) Most translations understand the word as "assurance" or "conviction": RSV and NEB footnote "assurance"; Phps "full confidence"; NAB "confident assurance"; or verbal expressions like to be sure; Mft "we are confident." (c) Some French translations have "guarantee," perhaps because "the word was often used in legal documents of the time for the title-deeds of a piece of property" (TNT note)...

191316 KJV wording: communicate - corrected translation: share [your belongings].
200112 KJV wording: the Lord - corrected wording: he [literally omit: the Lord] - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). The Greek verb for "hath promised" has no subject; thus, based upon the grammatical construction the subject is actually he. It is generally assumed that the implied subject is either the Lord or God. Later Greek manuscripts, such as the one upon which the KJV was translated, added the Greek words ho kurios (the Lord).

200304 KJV wording: GOVERNOR - modern translation: pilot.
200304 KJV wording: LISTETH - modern translation: willeth.

200312 KJV wording: VINE - alternative translation: grapevine.
200312 KJV wording: FOUNTAIN - alternative translation: spring.
200313 KJV wording: conversation - correct modern translation: way of life or behavior. It is worth noting that in the 20 times that Hebrew and Greek words are translated in the KJV as "conversation", not once does it have anything to do with verbal communication. In 19 of the occrurances, the meaning basically is "behavior" or "way of life." In Phi 3:20 the Greek word is politeuma, which means "commonwealth," "citizenship," "enfranchisement," or "community."
200317 KJV wording: EASY TO BE ENTREATED - alternative translation: compliant [or: willing to yield - NRSV].

210414 omit KJV wording: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
210510 Gr: {ek Christo [Iesou]}. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text. The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. NRSV - 10 And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, support, strengthen, and establish you. NAB - 10 The God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory through Christ (Jesus) will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you after you have suffered a little.
220101 omit from KJV wording: OUR (immediately preceding "Saviour") - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
220103 KJV wording: to glory and virtue - corrected wording: by his own glory and virtue - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
220104 KJV wording: unto us exceeding great and precious - corrected wording: to us precious and very great - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). This simply represents a change of the word order in the Greek text. In accordance with the original Greek text, this change reflects a correction of the 16th century Greek text from which the KJV was translated.
220106 TEMPERANCE or: self-control.
220107 KJV wording: CHARITY - modern translation: love (Greek: {agape}).
220201 HERESIES or: factions.

220310 KJV wording: SHALL BE BURNED UP - corrected wording: shall be found - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
220311 KJV wording: CONVERSATION - corrected translation: way of life (or: behavior).
230201 KJV wording: advocate <same Greek word ({parakleton}) translated as "Comforter" in John 14, 15, and 16> In the KJV the same Greek word {parakletoV} is translated "Comforter" in Joh 14:16 and is translated "advocate" in 1Jo 2:1, which also is translatable as "the defense attorney," "advocate," or "counsellor."
230216 LUST or: desire.
230224 KJV wording: remain - more consistent wording: abide. Note: "remain" was translated from the same Greek word from which "abide" was translated earlier in this verse.
230224 KJV wording: continue more consistent wording: abide. Note: "continue" was translated from the same Greek word from which "abide" was translated earlier in this verse.
230301 KJV wording: sons corrected translation: children.
230301 (after "sons of God") - add to KJV wording: -- and we are - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
230309 HIS SEED or: His seed (or: God's seed).
230313 Gr: {[kai] me}. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text. The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 13 Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you. NRSV - 13 Do not be astonished, brothers and sisters, that the world hates you. NAB - 13 Do not be amazed, (then,) brothers, if the world hates you.

230317 BOWELS or: heart.
230317 GOOD or: goods.
230319 Gr: {[kai] en touto}. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text. The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 19 By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; NRSV - 19 And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him; NAB - 19 (Now) this is how we shall know that we belong to the truth and reassure our hearts before him.
230419 omit KJV wording: him - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
230501 Gr: {[kai] ton}. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text. The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him. NRSV - 1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child. NAB - 1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten by God, and everyone who loves the father loves (also) the one begotten by him.
230502 KEEP in KJV, change to: do - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
230507 (and verse 8) omit KJV wording: in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text) This text is not found in any modern English versions, i.e., not found in those versions that are translated from the current representations of the original texts. (The NKJV is not such a modern translation. It is still totally dependent upon the KJV and the same faulty Hebrew and Greek texts from which the KJV was translated.) Even up to the fifth and final edition of Erasmus' Greek text in 1535, Erasmus fell prey to pressure and manipulation from church authorities to add to subsequent editions phrases and entire verses that he strongly (and rightly) suspected were not part of the original text. (The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, Second Edition, Oxford University Press, 1968, pages 100-101, which document how Erasmus was conned to include what is translated in the KJV in 1Jo 5:7-8, the following text: "in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth." Erasmus' 1535 edition still relied upon no more than six Greek manuscripts, the oldest (but least used!) of which was from the tenth century. In Biblical Hermeneutics (edited by Bruce Corley, Steve W. Lemke, and Grant Lovejoy, Nashville, TN: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 2002, page 388), Harold Freeman, in his chapter on "Biblical Criticism and Biblical Preaching" writes: "Textual criticism is the discipline that seeks to identify the original wording of an ancient document. Textual criticism of the Bible benefits preaching by preventing nonbiblical sermons. ...We regret giving up a nice doctrinal sermon on the Trinity based on 1 John 5:7b (KJV). Nevertheless, if it is determined that these are additions to the original writings, whether intentional or accidental, biblical preaching based on these texts cannot occur... Sermons based on spurious or corrupted texts cannot be genuinely biblical. The determination of exactly what the Scripture said is the starting point for biblical preaching."
230513 omit KJV wording: and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
230513 KJV wording: These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. - corrected wording: These things I wrote to you so that you may know that you have eternal life -- for those believing in the name [authority, character, or cause] of the Son of God. - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
230518 KJV wording: himself - corrected wording: him - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
230518 KJV wording: that wicked one - corrected translation: the evil one (this uses the exactly same Greek word that is used in the Matthew's version of the Lord's Prayer, Mat 6:12 (KJV: "evil" - most modern translations: "the evil one").
230521 omit KJV wording: Amen - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).

240108 WE (third occurrence) in KJV, change to: you.

250106 CHARITY or: love.
260112 KJV wording: CHARITY - modern translation: love.
260125 omit KJV wording: wise - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). Bruce Metzger (A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Second Edition, New York: United Bible Societies, 1994, page 661) comments: "After {mono} [translated as "only"], K L P and many minuscules [manuscripts written in cursive letters, dating from the 9th century], followed by the Textus Receptus [16th century], add {sopho} [translated as "wise"], thus assimilating the doxology to Ro 16:27.
260125 (immediately before the word majesty) - omit KJV wording: and - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
260125 (immediately after the word power) - add to KJV wording: through Jesus Christ our Lord - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
260125 omit KJV wording: both - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
260125 add to KJV wording: (immediately before the word now): before all time and - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). Bruce Metzger comments: "Several of the later uncials, as well as most minuscules (followed by the Textus Receptus), omit {pro pantos tou aionos} [translated as "before all the age/aeon"], perhaps because the expression did not seem to be appropriate in a doxology. The words {pro pantos tou aionos} are strongly supported by [the majority of the most trustworthy ancient manuscripts].
270105 KJV wording: washed - corrected wording: loosed - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
270106 KJV wording: kings and priests - corrected wording: a kingdom, priests or a kingdom of priests - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
270108 omit KJV wording: the beginning and the ending - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
270108 (after LORD) - add to KJV wording: God - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
270111 omit KJV wording: I am alpha and omega, the first and the last: and, - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). It should be noted that the phrases "Alpha and Omega," "the first and the last," and/or "the beginning and the end" are found in the original texts of Rev. 1:8, 1:17, 2:8, 21:6, and 22:13. (These phrases are allusions to the wording in Isaiah 44:6 and 48:12.) Of these five verses Rev. 22:13 is closest to the KJV's wording in the beginning of Rev. 1:11, but even in Rev. 22:13 the KJV needs some correction.
270215 omit KJV wording: WHICH THING I HATE - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
270219 CHARITY: love.
270228 morning star: Robert Bratcher and Howard Hatton (A Handbook on The Revelation to John, NY: UBS, 1993, page 64) comment: "The morning star is probably the planet Venus, a symbol of victory and domination. Victorious Roman generals built temples in honor of Venus, and the sign of Venus was on the standards of Caesar's legions. In [Rev] 22.16 Christ himself is the morning star..."
270403 SARDINE: sardius.
270411 KJV wording: O Lord - corrected wording: our Lord and God (literally: the Lord and the God of us) - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).

271403 Gr: [{hoV}]. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text. The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 3 and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. NRSV - 3 and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who have been redeemed from the earth. NAB - 3 They were singing (what seemed to be) a new hymn before the throne, before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn this hymn except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been ransomed from the earth.
271405 omit KJV wording: BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
271605 KJV wording: AND SHALT BE - corrected wording: O Holy One - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
271807 DELICIOUSLY: wantonly.

271820 KJV wording: HOLY - corrected wording: saints and - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
271901 omit KJV wording: the Lord - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
271905 Gr: {[kai] hoi phoboumenoi}. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text. The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 5 And from the throne came a voice saying, "Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, small and great." NRSV - 5 And from the throne came a voice saying, "Praise our God, all you his servants, and all who fear him, small and great." NAB - 5 A voice coming from the throne said: "Praise our God, all you his servants, (and) you who revere him, small and great."
272013 KJV wording: HELL, Greek: Hades.
272102 omit KJV wording: John - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272102 KJV wording: PREPARED AS A BRIDE ADORNED FOR HER HUSBAND - modern translation: like a bride beautifully dressed and ready to meet her husband.
272103 KJV wording: out of heaven - corrected wording: from the throne - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272103 KJV wording: great - modern translation: loud.
272103 KJV wording: tabernacle - modern translation: dwelling (or: home).
272103 KJV wording: dwell - modern translation: live.
272104 KJV wording: God - corrected wording: he - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272104 KJV wording: ARE PASSED - modern translation: have passed.
272104 KJV wording: for the former things are passed away - modern translation: for the first things have passed away (or: the old mode of things has passed away). Robert G. Bratcher and Howard A. Hatton (A Handbook on The Revelation to John, New York: United Bible Societies, 1993, page 298) comment: "For the former things are passed away: this means that the old mode of existence, in which death, mourning, weeping, and pain were an inescapable part of the human situation, will be replaced by a new manner of life that does not include them. "The old world (or, universe) will no longer exist" (see 2 Cor 5:17). God's promise in verse 5 is realized."
272109 omit KJV wording: unto me - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272109 KJV wording: Come hither - modern translation: come (or: come here).
272109 KJV wording: And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me saying, come hither, I will show thee the bride, the lamb's wife. - corrected wording: Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb." (NRSV) - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). In this verse the KJV's Textus Receptus Greek text needs corrections involving nine different Greek words. Two words ({proV me}, "unto me") need to be omitted. The word ek ("of") needs to be added after eis ("one") Three words ({tou arniou teyn gunaika}, which in English is translated "the Lamb's wife", needs to be rearranged to read, {teyn gunaika tou arniou}), and three other words are slightly different. All this having been said, the meaning of this particular passage is not dramatically altered by the corrections, but often, in other verses, the corrections result in major differences in meaning.
272110 omit KJV wording: great - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272111 omit KJV wording: and - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272111 KJV wording: A STONE MOST PRECIOUS or: a rare stone (or: a very valuable jewel).
272111 KJV wording: LIKE A JASPER STONE, CLEAR AS CRYSTAL or: like a crystal-clear jasper.
272112 Gr: [{ta onomata}]. With strong support from very early ancient manuscripts, the ESV [book review] omits the UBS4's bracketed wording as not having been part of the original text. The removal of that wording has virtually no impact on the meaning of the verse, as shown below in the comparison with the NRSV [book review] (which rarely uses brackets, even when it retains the UBS4's bracketed wording) and the NAB [book review] ( which consistently retains all of the UBS4's bracketed wording within parentheses). ESV - 12 It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed- NRSV - 12 It has a great, high wall with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates are inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites; NAB - 12 It had a massive, high wall, with twelve gates where twelve angels were stationed and on which names were inscribed, (the names) of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.
272116 KJV wording: LIES FOURSQUARE or: was laid out like a square.
272116 omit KJV wording: as large - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272123 KJV wording: shine in - corrected wording: shine upon (or: shine on) - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272123 - KJV wording: LIGHT - modern wording: lamp.
272124 omit KJV wording: of them which are saved [Greek omit: {ton sozomenon}] - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272124 omit KJV wording: and honour - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272124 KJV wording: in - corrected wording: by means of [Greek : {en} TO: {dia}] - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). The Textus Receptus substitutes the Greek word en, which in English is translatable as "in", for the Greek word dia., which in English means "by means of", "through", or "with".
272124 KJV wording: and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it - corrected wording: The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. [NRSV] - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). In this entire verse the Textus Receptus needs quite a few corrections. The NRSV translation above is an accurate and quite literal translation of the original Greek text.
272127 KJV wording: IN NO WISE or: by no means.
272127 KJV wording: any thing that defileth - modern translation: any profane thing (or: anything unclean, or anything defiled, or anything unclean). "Unclean" or "profane" in a religious sense means to be defiled in a way that prevents the worship of God.
272127 KJV wording: whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie - modern translation: anyone who practices abomination or falsehood.
272127 KJV wording: but they - modern translation: but only they.
272205 KJV wording: they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: - corrected wording: they do not have need of lamplight and sunlight, because the Lord God will shine light on them - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). In this verse the wording of the Textus Receptus -- and subsequently the KJV -- needs many corrections.
272208 KJV wording: saw these and heard them - corrected wording: heard and saw these things - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272208 KJV wording: BEFORE THE FEET or: at the feet.
272209 omit KJV wording: for (Greek omit: {gar}) - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272209 KJV wording: SEE THOU DO IT NOT: or You must not do that!.
272209 KJV wording: THY FELLOWSERVANT or: a fellow servant of you (or: a fellow servant with you or a fellow servant like you).
272214 KJV wording: that do his commandments - corrected wording: who wash their robes - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
272219 KJV wording: book of life - corrected wording: tree of life - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text). Bruce Metzger (TCGNT p. 690) comments: "22.19 apo tou xulou. Instead of apo tou xulou, the Textus Receptus (followed by the King James Version) reads apo biblou, a reading that occurs in no Greek manuscript. The error arose when Erasmus, in order to provide copy for the last six verses of Revelation (which were lacking in the only Greek manuscript of Revelation available to him), translated the verses from the Latin Vulgate into Greek. The corruption of "tree" into "book" had occurred earlier in the transmission of the Latin text when a scribe accidentally miscopied the correct word ligno ("tree") as libro ("book")."
272221 omit KJV wording: Amen. - (based on a needed correction of the KJV's Greek text).
012422 Needs an additional word to clarify the meaning. It should say "there should no flesh be saved alive."
012749 Omits text which was in older texts. The RSV puts it in a footnote: "And another took a spear and pierced His side, and out came water and blood." The Savior's death came when a soldier pierced His side, Revelation 1:7.
012801 "In the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week..." should be translated literally, "Now late on Sabbath, as it was getting dusk toward the first day of the week..." The Sabbath does not end at dawn but at dusk.
030214 Should say, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men of God's good pleasure or choosing." That is, there will be peace on earth among men who have God's good will in their hearts.
031426 Has the unfortunate translation of the Greek word {miseo}, Srong's #3404, as "hate", when it should be rendered "love less by comparison." We are not to hate our parents and family!
032343 Has been erroneously used by some to claim that Jesus went straight to heaven at His death. The original Greek did not have punctuation marks as we do today. The KJV states, "And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise." The comma should not be after "thee",  but "day." The believing malefactor would be with Christ in the paradise of the redeemed when he was resurrected far into the future.
040131 Should say "baptize" or "baptizing." IN water" not with water. Pouring or sprinkling with water is not the scriptural method of baptism, but only thorough immersion in water.
040133 Should say "baptize" or "baptizing." IN water" not with water. Pouring or sprinkling with water is not the scriptural method of baptism, but only thorough immersion in water.
040117 Is another instance of a poor preposition. "By" should be "through": "For the law was given by [through] Moses ... Moses did not proclaim his law, but God's Law.
041302 Should be "And during supper" (RSV) rather than "And supper being ended" (KJV). (This one I must comment on because the KJV is very correct, the Greek tense is aorist - an action done in the past and completed - Keith Hunt).
051204 Has the inaccurate word "Easter" which should be rendered "Passover." The Greek word is {pascha} which is translated correctly as Passover in Matthew 26:2, etc. 
070118 Should be: "For the preaching of the cross is to them that are perishing foolishness; but unto us which are being saved it is the power of God", rather than "perish" and "are saved." Likewise, II Thessalonians 2:10 should be "are perishing" rather than "perish."
070719 Needs some italicized words to make the meaning clear. It should say: "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but [the important thing is] the keeping of the commandments of God."
071529 Should be: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the hope of the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the hope of the dead?"
080602 Should be "a day of salvation", instead of "the day of salvation." This is a quote from Isaiah 49:8, which is correct. The day of salvation is not the same for each individual. The firstfruits have their day of salvation during this life. The rest in the second resurrection.
120216 (and verse 17) can be properly understood only if the KJV italicized word "is" in verse 1 is left out, as it should be. The message of these verses is: don't let men judge you as doing wrong when you observe the holy days, new moons and sabbaths; let the body of Christ (the Church) do the judging.
150408 Should say, "For bodily exercise profiteth for a little time: but godliness in profitable unto all things...
150610 Should be, "For the love of money is a [not the] root of all evil . . . ."
150311 Has "their" in italics, which is not implied in the original.
190408 Should be "Joshua" rather than "Jesus", although these two words are Hebrew and Greek equivalents.
190409 Should read, "There remaineth therefore a keeping of a sabbath to the people of God."
190928 Is out of proper order in the King James. It should be: "So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them without sin that look for him shall he appear the second time unto salvation."
220205 Should not have "person" Noah was the eighth preacher of righteousness.
230223 Has "[but] he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also" in italics. This is an addition based upon the Latin text and not in the original Greek.
281404 Should be "a firstfruits", because the 144,000 are not all the firstfruits.
272004 (and verse 5) in the KJV is a little confusing until you realize that the sentence "This is the first resurrection." in verse five refers back to "they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years" in verse four.
272010 "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are [correction: should be 'were cast' because the beast and false prophet were mortal human beings who were burned up in the lake of fire 1,000 years previous to this time, Revelation 19:20], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever." The is that Satan will be cast into the same lake fire into which the beast and false prophet were cast a thousand years previously.
272202 Should be "health" rather than "healing."

160316 The early Church Father, Tertullian, quoted this passage from early Greek texts as, "All scripture suitable for instruction is divinely inspired." This is very likely a much more accurate and undoubtedly more original reading. This means that the original Greek Text was likely "{pasa grafh qeopneustoV kai wfelimoV proV paideian}."
