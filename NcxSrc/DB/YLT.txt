010101 A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
010102 Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren,
010103 and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,
010104 and Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
010105 and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,
010106 and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon, of her [who had been] Uriah's,
010107 and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa,
010108 and Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah,
010109 and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,
010110 and Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah,
010111 and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, at the Babylonian removal.
010112 And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,
010113 and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,
010114 and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,
010115 and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
010116 and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was begotten Jesus, who is named Christ.
010117 All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David [are] fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ, fourteen generations.
010118 And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,
010119 and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.
010120 And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife, for that which in her was begotten [is] of the Holy Spirit,
010121 and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'
010122 And all this hath come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
010123 'Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being interpreted 'With us [he is] God.'
010124 And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,
010125 and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.
010201 And Jesus having been born in Beth-Lehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, lo, mages from the east came to Jerusalem,
010202 saying, 'Where is he who was born king of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and we came to bow to him.'
010203 And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all Jerusalem with him,
010204 and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born.
010205 And they said to him, 'In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it hath been written through the prophet,
010206 And thou, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, thou art by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, for out of thee shall come one leading, who shall feed My people Israel.'
010207 Then Herod, privately having called the mages, did inquire exactly from them the time of the appearing star,
010208 and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, 'Having gone -- inquire ye exactly for the child, and whenever ye may have found, bring me back word, that I also having come may bow to him.'
010209 And they, having heard the king, departed, and lo, the star, that they did see in the east, did go before them, till, having come, it stood over where the child was.
010210 And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy,
010211 and having come to the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and having fallen down they bowed to him, and having opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,
010212 and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back unto Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own region.
010213 And on their having withdrawn, lo, a messenger of the Lord doth appear in a dream to Joseph, saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and be thou there till I may speak to thee, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.'
010214 And he, having risen, took the child and his mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt,
010215 and he was there till the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 'Out of Egypt I did call My Son.'
010216 Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the mages, was very wroth, and having sent forth, he slew all the male children in Beth-Lehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from the mages.
010217 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
010218 'A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and much mourning -- Rachel weeping [for] her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not.'
010219 And Herod having died, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream doth appear to Joseph in Egypt,
010220 saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and be going to the land of Israel, for they have died -- those seeking the life of the child.'
010221 And he, having risen, took the child and his mother, and came to the land of Israel,
010222 and having heard that Archelaus doth reign over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither, and having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the parts of Galilee,
010223 and coming, he dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets, that 'A Nazarene he shall be called.'
010301 And in those days cometh John the Baptist, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea,
010302 and saying, 'Reform, for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens,'
010303 for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight make ye His paths.'
010304 And this John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a girdle of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field.
010305 Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,
010306 and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.
010307 And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism, he said to them, 'Brood of vipers! who did shew you to flee from the coming wrath?
010308 bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,
010309 and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have -- Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham,
010310 and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and to fire is cast.
010311 'I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,
010312 whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'
010313 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John to be baptized by him,
010314 but John was forbidding him, saying, 'I have need by thee to be baptized -- and thou dost come unto me!'
010315 But Jesus answering said to him, 'Suffer now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,' then he doth suffer him.
010316 And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,
010317 and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, 'This is My Son -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'
010401 Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil,
010402 and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he did hunger.
010403 And the Tempter having come to him said, 'If Son thou art of God -- speak that these stones may become loaves.'
010404 But he answering said, 'It hath been written, Not upon bread alone doth man live, but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God.'
010405 Then doth the Devil take him to the [holy] city, and doth set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
010406 and saith to him, 'If Son thou art of God -- cast thyself down, for it hath been written, that, His messengers He shall charge concerning thee, and on hands they shall bear thee up, that thou mayest not dash on a stone thy foot.'
010407 Jesus said to him again, 'It hath been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.'
010408 Again doth the Devil take him to a very high mount, and doth shew to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,
010409 and saith to him, 'All these to thee I will give, if falling down thou mayest bow to me.'
010410 Then saith Jesus to him, 'Go -- Adversary, for it hath been written, The Lord thy God thou shalt bow to, and Him only thou shalt serve.'
010411 Then doth the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and were ministering to him.
010412 And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did withdraw to Galilee,
010413 and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalim,
010414 that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
010415 'Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! --
010416 the people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light arose to them.'
010417 From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, 'Reform ye, for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens.'
010418 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea -- for they were fishers --
010419 and he saith to them, 'Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men,'
010420 and they, immediately, having left the nets, did follow him.
010421 And having advanced thence, he saw other two brothers, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,
010422 and they, immediately, having left the boat and their father, did follow him.
010423 And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people,
010424 and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.
010425 And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
010501 And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mount, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him,
010502 and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:
010503 'Happy the poor in spirit -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens.
010504 'Happy the mourning -- because they shall be comforted.
010505 'Happy the meek -- because they shall inherit the land.
010506 'Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness -- because they shall be filled.
010507 'Happy the kind -- because they shall find kindness.
010508 'Happy the clean in heart -- because they shall see God.
010509 'Happy the peacemakers -- because they shall be called Sons of God.
010510 'Happy those persecuted for righteousness' sake -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens.
010511 'Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you, and may persecute, and may say any evil thing against you falsely for my sake --
010512 rejoice ye and be glad, because your reward [is] great in the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you.
010513 'Ye are the salt of the land, but if the salt may lose savour, in what shall it be salted? for nothing is it good henceforth, except to be cast without, and to be trodden down by men.
010514 'Ye are the light of the world, a city set upon a mount is not able to be hid;
010515 nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it shineth to all those in the house;
010516 so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father who [is] in the heavens.
010517 'Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the prophets -- I did not come to throw down, but to fulfill;
010518 for, verily I say to you, till that the heaven and the earth may pass away, one iota or one tittle may not pass away from the law, till that all may come to pass.
010519 'Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the least -- and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the reign of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach [them], he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens.
010520 'For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye may not enter to the reign of the heavens.
010521 'Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not kill, and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment;
010522 but I -- I say to you, that every one who is angry at his brother without cause, shall be in danger of the judgment, and whoever may say to his brother, Empty fellow! shall be in danger of the sanhedrim, and whoever may say, Rebel! shall be in danger of the gehenna of the fire.
010523 'If, therefore, thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar, and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything against thee,
010524 leave there thy gift before the altar, and go -- first be reconciled to thy brother, and then having come bring thy gift.
010525 'Be agreeing with thy opponent quickly, while thou art in the way with him, that the opponent may not deliver thee to the judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and to prison thou mayest be cast,
010526 verily I say to thee, thou mayest not come forth thence till that thou mayest pay the last farthing.
010527 'Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not commit adultery;
010528 but I -- I say to you, that every one who is looking on a woman to desire her, did already commit adultery with her in his heart.
010529 'But, if thy right eye doth cause thee to stumble, pluck it out and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.
010530 'And, if thy right hand doth cause thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.
010531 'And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let him give to her a writing of divorce;
010532 but I -- I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife, save for the matter of whoredom, doth make her to commit adultery; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth commit adultery.
010533 'Again, ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not swear falsely, but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine oaths;
010534 but I -- I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God,
010535 nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is a city of a great king,
010536 nor by thy head mayest thou swear, because thou art not able one hair to make white or black;
010537 but let your word be, Yes, Yes, No, No, and that which is more than these is of the evil.
010538 'Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth;
010539 but I -- I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever shall slap thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other;
010540 and whoever is willing to take thee to law, and thy coat to take -- suffer to him also the cloak.
010541 'And whoever shall impress thee one mile, go with him two,
010542 to him who is asking of thee be giving, and him who is willing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away.
010543 'Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and shalt hate thine enemy;
010544 but I -- I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those accusing you falsely, and persecuting you,
010545 that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good, and He doth send rain on righteous and unrighteous.
010546 'For, if ye may love those loving you, what reward have ye? do not also the tax-gatherers the same?
010547 and if ye may salute your brethren only, what do ye abundant? do not also the tax-gatherers so?
010548 ye shall therefore be perfect, as your Father who [is] in the heavens is perfect.
010601 'Take heed your kindness not to do before men, to be seen by them, and if not -- reward ye have not from your Father who [is] in the heavens;
010602 whenever, therefore, thou mayest do kindness, thou mayest not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory from men; verily I say to you -- they have their reward!
010603 'But thou, doing kindness, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth,
010604 that thy kindness may be in secret, and thy Father who is seeing in secret Himself shall reward thee manifestly.
010605 'And when thou mayest pray, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, because they love in the synagogues, and in the corners of the broad places -- standing -- to pray, that they may be seen of men; verily I say to you, that they have their reward.
010606 'But thou, when thou mayest pray, go into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who [is] in secret, and thy Father who is seeing in secret, shall reward thee manifestly.
010607 'And -- praying -- ye may not use vain repetitions like the nations, for they think that in their much speaking they shall be heard,
010608 be ye not therefore like to them, for your Father doth know those things that ye have need of before your asking him;
010609 thus therefore pray ye: 'Our Father who [art] in the heavens! hallowed be Thy name.
010610 'Thy reign come: Thy will come to pass, as in heaven also on the earth.
010611 'Our appointed bread give us to-day.
010612 'And forgive us our debts, as also we forgive our debtors.
010613 'And mayest Thou not lead us to temptation, but deliver us from the evil, because Thine is the reign, and the power, and the glory -- to the ages. Amen.
010614 'For, if ye may forgive men their trespasses He also will forgive you -- your Father who [is] in the heavens;
010615 but if ye may not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
010616 'And when ye may fast, be ye not as the hypocrites, of sour countenances, for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men fasting; verily I say to you, that they have their reward.
010617 'But thou, fasting, anoint thy head, and wash thy face,
010618 that thou mayest not appear to men fasting, but to thy Father who [is] in secret, and thy Father, who is seeing in secret, shall reward thee manifestly.
010619 'Treasure not up to yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust disfigure, and where thieves break through and steal,
010620 but treasure up to yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth disfigure, and where thieves do not break through nor steal,
010621 for where your treasure is, there will be also your heart.
010622 'The lamp of the body is the eye, if, therefore, thine eye may be perfect, all thy body shall be enlightened,
010623 but if thine eye may be evil, all thy body shall be dark; if, therefore, the light that [is] in thee is darkness -- the darkness, how great!
010624 'None is able to serve two lords, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to the one, and despise the other; ye are not able to serve God and Mammon.
010625 'Because of this I say to you, be not anxious for your life, what ye may eat, and what ye may drink, nor for your body, what ye may put on. Is not the life more than the nourishment, and the body than the clothing?
010626 look to the fowls of the heaven, for they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into storehouses, and your heavenly Father doth nourish them; are not ye much better than they?
010627 'And who of you, being anxious, is able to add to his age one cubit?
010628 and about clothing why are ye anxious? consider well the lilies of the field; how do they grow? they do not labour, nor do they spin;
010629 and I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
010630 'And if the herb of the field, that to-day is, and to-morrow is cast to the furnace, God doth so clothe -- not much more you, O ye of little faith?
010631 therefore ye may not be anxious, saying, What may we eat? or, What may we drink? or, What may we put round?
010632 for all these do the nations seek for, for your heavenly Father doth know that ye have need of all these;
010633 but seek ye first the reign of God and His righteousness, and all these shall be added to you.
010634 Be not therefore anxious for the morrow, for the morrow shall be anxious for its own things; sufficient for the day [is] the evil of it.
010701 'Judge not, that ye may not be judged,
010702 for in what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and in what measure ye measure, it shall be measured to you.
010703 'And why dost thou behold the mote that [is] in thy brother's eye, and the beam that [is] in thine own eye dost not consider?
010704 or, how wilt thou say to thy brother, Suffer I may cast out the mote from thine eye, and lo, the beam [is] in thine own eye?
010705 Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.
010706 'Ye may not give that which is [holy] to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine, that they may not trample them among their feet, and having turned -- may rend you.
010707 'Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you;
010708 for every one who is asking doth receive, and he who is seeking doth find, and to him who is knocking it shall be opened.
010709 'Or what man is of you, of whom, if his son may ask a loaf -- a stone will he present to him?
010710 and if a fish he may ask -- a serpent will he present to him?
010711 if, therefore, ye being evil, have known good gifts to give to your children, how much more shall your Father who [is] in the heavens give good things to those asking him?
010712 'All things, therefore, whatever ye may will that men may be doing to you, so also do to them, for this is the law and the prophets.
010713 'Go ye in through the strait gate, because wide [is] the gate, and broad the way that is leading to the destruction, and many are those going in through it;
010714 how strait [is] the gate, and compressed the way that is leading to the life, and few are those finding it!
010715 'But, take heed of the false prophets, who come unto you in sheep's clothing, and inwardly are ravening wolves.
010716 From their fruits ye shall know them; do [men] gather from thorns grapes? or from thistles figs?
010717 so every good tree doth yield good fruits, but the bad tree doth yield evil fruits.
010718 A good tree is not able to yield evil fruits, nor a bad tree to yield good fruits.
010719 Every tree not yielding good fruit is cut down and is cast to fire:
010720 therefore from their fruits ye shall know them.
010721 'Not every one who is saying to me Lord, lord, shall come into the reign of the heavens; but he who is doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens.
010722 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, lord, have we not in thy name prophesied? and in thy name cast out demons? and in thy name done many mighty things?
010723 and then I will acknowledge to them, that -- I never knew you, depart from me ye who are working lawlessness.
010724 'Therefore, every one who doth hear of me these words, and doth do them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock;
010725 and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell not, for it had been founded on the rock.
010726 'And every one who is hearing of me these words, and is not doing them, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand;
010727 and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell, and its fall was great.'
010728 And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,
010729 for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
010801 And when he came down from the mount, great multitudes did follow him,
010802 and lo, a leper having come, was bowing to him, saying, 'Sir, if thou art willing, thou art able to cleanse me;'
010803 and having stretched forth the hand, Jesus touched him, saying, 'I will, be thou cleansed,' and immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
010804 And Jesus saith to him, 'See, thou mayest tell no one, but go, thyself shew to the priest, and bring the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony to them.'
010805 And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion calling upon him,
010806 and saying, 'Sir, my young man hath been laid in the house a paralytic, fearfully afflicted,'
010807 and Jesus saith to him, 'I, having come, will heal him.'
010808 And the centurion answering said, 'Sir, I am not worthy that thou mayest enter under my roof, but only say a word, and my servant shall be healed;
010809 for I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Be coming, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth [it].'
010810 And Jesus having heard, did wonder, and said to those following, 'Verily I say to you, not even in Israel so great faith have I found;
010811 and I say to you, that many from east and west shall come and recline (at meat) with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the reign of the heavens,
010812 but the sons of the reign shall be cast forth to the outer darkness -- there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.'
010813 And Jesus said to the centurion, 'Go, and as thou didst believe let it be to thee;' and his young man was healed in that hour.
010814 And Jesus having come into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law laid, and fevered,
010815 and he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose, and was ministering to them.
010816 And evening having come, they brought to him many demoniacs, and he did cast out the spirits with a word, and did heal all who were ill,
010817 that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'Himself took our infirmities, and the sicknesses he did bear.'
010818 And Jesus having seen great multitudes about him, did command to depart to the other side;
010819 and a certain scribe having come, said to him, 'Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go;'
010820 and Jesus saith to him, 'The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not where he may lay the head.'
010821 And another of his disciples said to him, 'Sir, permit me first to depart and to bury my father;'
010822 and Jesus said to him, 'Follow me, and suffer the dead to bury their own dead.'
010823 And when he entered into the boat his disciples did follow him,
010824 and lo, a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves, but he was sleeping,
010825 and his disciples having come to him, awoke him, saying, 'Sir, save us; we are perishing.'
010826 And he saith to them, 'Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?' Then having risen, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm;
010827 and the men wondered, saying, 'What kind -- is this, that even the wind and the sea do obey him?'
010828 And he having come to the other side, to the region of the Gergesenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming forth out of the tombs, very fierce, so that no one was able to pass over by that way,
010829 and lo, they cried out, saying, 'What -- to us and to thee, Jesus, Son of God? didst thou come hither, before the time, to afflict us?'
010830 And there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding,
010831 and the demons were calling on him, saying, 'If thou dost cast us forth, permit us to go away to the herd of the swine;'
010832 and he saith to them, 'Go.' And having come forth, they went to the herd of the swine, and lo, the whole herd of the swine rushed down the steep, to the sea, and died in the waters,
010833 and those feeding did flee, and, having gone to the city, they declared all, and the matter of the demoniacs.
010834 And lo, all the city came forth to meet Jesus, and having seen him, they called on [him] that he might depart from their borders.
010901 And having gone to the boat, he passed over, and came to his own city,
010902 and lo, they were bringing to him a paralytic, laid upon a couch, and Jesus having seen their faith, said to the paralytic, 'Be of good courage, child, thy sins have been forgiven thee.'
010903 And lo, certain of the scribes said within themselves, 'This one doth speak evil.'
010904 And Jesus, having known their thoughts, said, 'Why think ye evil in your hearts?
010905 for which is easier? to say, The sins have been forgiven to thee; or to say, Rise, and walk?
010906 'But, that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power upon the earth to forgive sins -- (then saith he to the paralytic) -- having risen, take up thy couch, and go to thy house.'
010907 And he, having risen, went to his house,
010908 and the multitudes having seen, wondered, and glorified God, who did give such power to men.
010909 And Jesus passing by thence, saw a man sitting at the tax-office, named Matthew, and saith to him, 'Be following me,' and he, having risen, did follow him.
010910 And it came to pass, he reclining (at meat) in the house, that lo, many tax-gatherers and sinners having come, were lying (at meat) with Jesus and his disciples,
010911 and the Pharisees having seen, said to his disciples, 'Wherefore with the tax-gatherers and sinners doth your teacher eat?'
010912 And Jesus having heard, said to them, 'They who are whole have no need of a physician, but they who are ill;
010913 but having gone, learn ye what is, Kindness I will, and not sacrifice, for I did not come to call righteous men, but sinners, to reformation.'
010914 Then come to him do the disciples of John, saying, 'Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy disciples fast not?'
010915 And Jesus said to them, 'Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn, so long as the bridegroom is with them? but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them, and then they shall fast.
010916 'And no one doth put a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment, for its filling up doth take from the garment, and a worse rent is made.
010917 'Nor do they put new wine into old skins, and if not -- the skins burst, and the wine doth run out, and the skins are destroyed, but they put new wine into new skins, and both are preserved together.'
010918 While he is speaking these things to them, lo, a ruler having come, was bowing to him, saying that 'My daughter just now died, but, having come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.'
010919 And Jesus having risen, did follow him, also his disciples,
010920 and lo, a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, having come to him behind, did touch the fringe of his garments,
010921 for she said within herself, 'If only I may touch his garment, I shall be saved.'
010922 And Jesus having turned about, and having seen her, said, 'Be of good courage, daughter, thy faith hath saved thee,' and the woman was saved from that hour.
010923 And Jesus having come to the house of the ruler, and having seen the minstrels and the multitude making tumult,
010924 he saith to them, 'Withdraw, for the damsel did not die, but doth sleep,' and they were deriding him;
010925 but, when the multitude was put forth, having gone in, he took hold of her hand, and the damsel arose,
010926 and the fame of this went forth to all the land.
010927 And Jesus passing on thence, two blind men followed him, calling and saying, 'Deal kindly with us, Son of David.'
010928 And he having come to the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus saith to them, 'Believe ye that I am able to do this?' They say to him, 'Yes, sir.'
010929 Then touched he their eyes, saying, 'According to your faith let it be to you,'
010930 and their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, 'See, let no one know;'
010931 but they, having gone forth, did spread his fame in all that land.
010932 And as they are coming forth, lo, they brought to him a man dumb, a demoniac,
010933 and the demon having been cast out, the dumb spake, and the multitude did wonder, saying that 'It was never so seen in Israel:'
010934 but the Pharisees said, 'By the ruler of the demons he doth cast out the demons.'
010935 And Jesus was going up and down all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every sickness and every malady among the people.
010936 And having seen the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, that they were faint and cast aside, as sheep not having a shepherd,
010937 then saith he to his disciples, 'The harvest indeed [is] abundant, but the workmen few;
010938 beseech ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he may put forth workmen to His harvest.'
011001 And having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave to them power over unclean spirits, so as to be casting them out, and to be healing every sickness, and every malady.
011002 And of the twelve apostles the names are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James of Zebedee, and John his brother;
011003 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James of Alpheus, and Lebbeus who was surnamed Thaddeus;
011004 Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot, who did also deliver him up.
011005 These twelve did Jesus send forth, having given command to them, saying, 'To the way of the nations go not away, and into a city of the Samaritans go not in,
011006 and be going rather unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
011007 'And, going on, proclaim saying that, the reign of the heavens hath come nigh;
011008 infirm ones be healing, lepers be cleansing, dead be raising, demons be casting out -- freely ye did receive, freely give.
011009 'Provide not gold, nor silver, nor brass in your girdles,
011010 nor scrip for the way, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor staff -- for the workman is worthy of his nourishment.
011011 'And into whatever city or village ye may enter, inquire ye who in it is worthy, and there abide, till ye may go forth.
011012 And coming to the house salute it,
011013 and if indeed the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it; and if it be not worthy, let your peace turn back to you.
011014 'And whoever may not receive you nor hear your words, coming forth from that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet,
011015 verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
011016 'Lo, I do send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves, be ye therefore wise as the serpents, and simple as the doves.
011017 And, take ye heed of men, for they will give you up to sanhedrims, and in their synagogues they will scourge you,
011018 and before governors and kings ye shall be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.
011019 'And whenever they may deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye may speak, for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak;
011020 for ye are not the speakers, but the Spirit of your Father that is speaking in you.
011021 'And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father child, and children shall rise up against parents, and shall put them to death,
011022 and ye shall be hated by all because of my name, but he who hath endured to the end, he shall be saved.
011023 'And whenever they may persecute you in this city, flee to the other, for verily I say to you, ye may not have completed the cities of Israel till the Son of Man may come.
011024 'A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his lord;
011025 sufficient to the disciple that he may be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord; if the master of the house they did call Beelzeboul, how much more those of his household?
011026 'Ye may not, therefore, fear them, for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed, and hid, that shall not be known;
011027 that which I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light, and that which you hear at the ear, proclaim on the house-tops.
011028 'And be not afraid of those killing the body, and are not able to kill the soul, but fear rather Him who is able both soul and body to destroy in gehenna.
011029 'Are not two sparrows sold for an assar? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father;
011030 and of you -- even the hairs of the head are all numbered;
011031 be not therefore afraid, than many sparrows ye are better.
011032 'Every one, therefore, who shall confess in me before men, I also will confess in him before my Father who is in the heavens;
011033 and whoever shall deny me before men, I also will deny him before my Father who is in the heavens.
011034 'Ye may not suppose that I came to put peace on the earth; I did not come to put peace, but a sword;
011035 for I came to set a man at variance against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,
011036 and the enemies of a man are those of his household.
011037 'He who is loving father or mother above me, is not worthy of me, and he who is loving son or daughter above me, is not worthy of me,
011038 and whoever doth not receive his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
011039 'He who found his life shall lose it, and he who lost his life for my sake shall find it.
011040 'He who is receiving you doth receive me, and he who is receiving me doth receive Him who sent me,
011041 he who is receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward, and he who is receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward,
011042 and whoever may give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say to you, he may not lose his reward.'
011101 And it came to pass, when Jesus ended directing his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
011102 And John having heard in the prison the works of the Christ, having sent two of his disciples,
011103 said to him, 'Art thou He who is coming, or for another do we look?'
011104 And Jesus answering said to them, 'Having gone, declare to John the things that ye hear and see,
011105 blind receive sight, and lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and deaf hear, dead are raised, and poor have good news proclaimed,
011106 and happy is he who may not be stumbled in me.'
011107 And as they are going, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, 'What went ye out to the wilderness to view? -- a reed shaken by the wind?
011108 'But what went ye out to see? -- a man clothed in soft garments? lo, those wearing the soft things are in the kings' houses.
011109 'But what went ye out to see? -- a prophet? yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet,
011110 for this is he of whom it hath been written, Lo, I do send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
011111 Verily I say to you, there hath not risen, among those born of women, a greater than John the Baptist, but he who is least in the reign of the heavens is greater than he.
011112 'And, from the days of John the Baptist till now, the reign of the heavens doth suffer violence, and violent men do take it by force,
011113 for all the prophets and the law till John did prophesy,
011114 and if ye are willing to receive [it], he is Elijah who was about to come;
011115 he who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.
011116 'And to what shall I liken this generation? it is like little children in market-places, sitting and calling to their comrades,
011117 and saying, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance, we lamented to you, and ye did not smite the breast.
011118 'For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon;
011119 the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Lo, a man, a glutton, and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners, and wisdom was justified of her children.'
011120 Then began he to reproach the cities in which were done most of his mighty works, because they did not reform.
011121 'Wo to thee, Chorazin! wo to thee, Bethsaida! because, if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago in sackcloth and ashes they had reformed;
011122 but I say to you, to Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in a day of judgment than for you.
011123 'And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades shalt be brought down, because if in Sodom had been done the mighty works that were done in thee, it had remained unto this day;
011124 but I say to you, to the land of Sodom it shall be more tolerable in a day of judgment than to thee.'
011125 At that time Jesus answering said, 'I do confess to Thee, Father, Lord of the heavens and of the earth, that thou didst hide these things from wise and understanding ones, and didst reveal them to babes.
011126 Yes, Father, because so it was good pleasure before Thee.
011127 'All things were delivered to me by my Father, and none doth know the Son, except the Father, nor doth any know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son may wish to reveal [Him].
011128 'Come unto me, all ye labouring and burdened ones, and I will give you rest,
011129 take up my yoke upon you, and learn from me, because I am meek and humble in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls,
011130 for my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.'
011201 At that time did Jesus go on the sabbaths through the corn, and his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck ears, and to eat,
011202 and the Pharisees having seen, said to him, 'Lo, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on a sabbath.'
011203 And he said to them, 'Did ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, himself and those with him --
011204 how he went into the house of God, and the loaves of the presentation did eat, which it is not lawful to him to eat, nor to those with him, except to the priests alone?
011205 'Or did ye not read in the Law, that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple do profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
011206 and I say to you, that a greater than the temple is here;
011207 and if ye had known what is: Kindness I will, and not sacrifice -- ye had not condemned the blameless,
011208 for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath.'
011209 And having departed thence, he went to their synagogue,
011210 and lo, there was a man having the hand withered, and they questioned him, saying, 'Is it lawful to heal on the sabbaths?' that they might accuse him.
011211 And he said to them, 'What man shall be of you, who shall have one sheep, and if this may fall on the sabbaths into a ditch, will not lay hold on it and raise [it]?
011212 How much better, therefore, is a man than a sheep? -- so that it is lawful on the sabbaths to do good.'
011213 Then saith he to the man, 'Stretch forth thy hand,' and he stretched [it] forth, and it was restored whole as the other.
011214 And the Pharisees having gone forth, held a consultation against him, how they might destroy him,
011215 and Jesus having known, withdrew thence, and there followed him great multitudes, and he healed them all,
011216 and did charge them that they might not make him manifest,
011217 that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
011218 'Lo, My servant, whom I did choose, My beloved, in whom My soul did delight, I will put My Spirit upon him, and judgment to the nations he shall declare,
011219 he shall not strive nor cry, nor shall any hear in the broad places his voice,
011220 a bruised reed he shall not break, and smoking flax he shall not quench, till he may put forth judgment to victory,
011221 and in his name shall nations hope.'
011222 Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb, and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.
011223 And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, 'Is this the Son of David?'
011224 but the Pharisees having heard, said, 'This one doth not cast out demons, except by Beelzeboul, ruler of the demons.'
011225 And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, 'Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated, and no city or house having been divided against itself, doth stand,
011226 and if the Adversary doth cast out the Adversary, against himself he was divided, how then doth his kingdom stand?
011227 'And if I, by Beelzeboul, do cast out the demons, your sons -- by whom do they cast out? because of this they -- they shall be your judges.
011228 'But if I, by the Spirit of God, do cast out the demons, then come already unto you did the reign of God.
011229 'Or how is one able to go into the house of the strong man, and to plunder his goods, if first he may not bind the strong man? and then his house he will plunder.
011230 'He who is not with me is against me, and he who is not gathering with me, doth scatter.
011231 Because of this I say to you, all sin and evil speaking shall be forgiven to men, but the evil speaking of the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.
011232 And whoever may speak a word against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven to him, but whoever may speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is coming.
011233 'Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad, for from the fruit is the tree known.
011234 'Brood of vipers! how are ye able to speak good things -- being evil? for out of the abundance of the heart doth the mouth speak.
011235 The good man out of the good treasure of the heart doth put forth the good things, and the evil man out of the evil treasure doth put forth evil things.
011236 'And I say to you, that every idle word that men may speak, they shall give for it a reckoning in a day of judgment;
011237 for from thy words thou shalt be declared righteous, and from thy words thou shalt be declared unrighteous.'
011238 Then answered certain of the scribes and Pharisees, saying, 'Teacher, we will to see a sign from thee.'
011239 And he answering said to them, 'A generation, evil and adulterous, doth seek a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet;
011240 for, as Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
011241 'Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, for they reformed at the proclamation of Jonah, and lo, a greater than Jonah here!
011242 'A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and lo, a greater than Solomon here!
011243 'And, when the unclean spirit may go forth from the man, it doth walk through dry places seeking rest, and doth not find;
011244 then it saith, I will turn back to my house whence I came forth; and having come, it findeth [it] unoccupied, swept, and adorned:
011245 then doth it go, and take with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and having gone in they dwell there, and the last of that man doth become worse than the first; so shall it be also to this evil generation.'
011246 And while he was yet speaking to the multitudes, lo, his mother and brethren had stood without, seeking to speak to him,
011247 and one said to him, 'Lo, thy mother and thy brethren do stand without, seeking to speak to thee.'
011248 And he answering said to him who spake to him, 'Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?'
011249 And having stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, he said, 'Lo, my mother and my brethren!
011250 for whoever may do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.'
011301 And in that day Jesus, having gone forth from the house, was sitting by the sea,
011302 and gathered together unto him were many multitudes, so that he having gone into the boat did sit down, and all the multitude on the beach did stand,
011303 and he spake to them many things in similes, saying: 'Lo, the sower went forth to sow,
011304 and in his sowing, some indeed fell by the way, and the fowls did come and devour them,
011305 and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth, and immediately they sprang forth, through not having depth of earth,
011306 and the sun having risen they were scorched, and through not having root, they withered,
011307 and others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns did come up and choke them,
011308 and others fell upon the good ground, and were giving fruit, some indeed a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty.
011309 He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.'
011310 And the disciples having come near, said to him, 'Wherefore in similes dost thou speak to them?'
011311 And he answering said to them that -- 'To you it hath been given to know the secrets of the reign of the heavens, and to these it hath not been given,
011312 for whoever hath, it shall be given to him, and he shall have overabundance, and whoever hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken from him.
011313 'Because of this, in similes do I speak to them, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor understand,
011314 and fulfilled on them is the prophecy of Isaiah, that saith, With hearing ye shall hear, and ye shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and ye shall not perceive,
011315 for made gross was the heart of this people, and with the ears they heard heavily, and their eyes they did close, lest they might see with the eyes, and with the ears might hear, and with the heart understand, and turn back, and I might heal them.
011316 'And happy are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear,
011317 for verily I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men did desire to see that which ye look on, and they did not see, and to hear that which ye hear, and they did not hear.
011318 'Ye, therefore, hear ye the simile of the sower:
011319 Every one hearing the word of the reign, and not understanding -- the evil one doth come, and doth catch that which hath been sown in his heart; this is that sown by the way.
011320 'And that sown on the rocky places, this is he who is hearing the word, and immediately with joy is receiving it,
011321 and he hath not root in himself, but is temporary, and persecution or tribulation having happened because of the word, immediately he is stumbled.
011322 'And that sown toward the thorns, this is he who is hearing the word, and the anxiety of this age, and the deceitfulness of the riches, do choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
011323 'And that sown on the good ground: this is he who is hearing the word, and is understanding, who indeed doth bear fruit, and doth make, some indeed a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty.'
011324 Another simile he set before them, saying: 'The reign of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field,
011325 and, while men are sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat, and went away,
011326 and when the herb sprang up, and yielded fruit, then appeared also the darnel.
011327 'And the servants of the householder, having come near, said to him, Sir, good seed didst thou not sow in thy field? whence then hath it the darnel?
011328 And he saith to them, A man, an enemy, did this; and the servants said to him, Wilt thou, then, [that] having gone away we may gather it up?
011329 'And he said, No, lest -- gathering up the darnel -- ye root up with it the wheat,
011330 suffer both to grow together till the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the darnel, and bind it in bundles, to burn it, and the wheat gather up into my storehouse.'
011331 Another simile he set before them, saying: 'The reign of the heavens is like to a grain of mustard, which a man having taken, did sow in his field,
011332 which less, indeed, is than all the seeds, but when it may be grown, is greatest of the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven do come and rest in its branches.'
011333 Another simile spake he to them: 'The reign of the heavens is like to leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.'
011334 All these things spake Jesus in similes to the multitudes, and without a simile he was not speaking to them,
011335 that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophet, saying, 'I will open in similes my mouth, I will utter things having been hidden from the foundation of the world.'
011336 Then having let away the multitudes, Jesus came to the house, and his disciples came near to him, saying, 'Explain to us the simile of the darnel of the field.'
011337 And he answering said to them, 'He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man,
011338 and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the reign, and the darnel are the sons of the evil one,
011339 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is a full end of the age, and the reapers are messengers.
011340 'As, then, the darnel is gathered up, and is burned with fire, so shall it be in the full end of this age,
011341 the Son of Man shall send forth his messengers, and they shall gather up out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks, and those doing the unlawlessness,
011342 and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
011343 'Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the reign of their Father. He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.
011344 'Again, the reign of the heavens is like to treasure hid in the field, which a man having found did hide, and from his joy goeth, and all, as much as he hath, he selleth, and buyeth that field.
011345 'Again, the reign of the heavens is like to a man, a merchant, seeking goodly pearls,
011346 who having found one pearl of great price, having gone away, hath sold all, as much as he had, and bought it.
011347 'Again, the reign of the heavens is like to a net that was cast into the sea, and did gather together of every kind,
011348 which, when it was filled, having drawn up again upon the beach, and having sat down, they gathered the good into vessels, and the bad they did cast out,
011349 so shall it be in the full end of the age, the messengers shall come forth and separate the evil out of the midst of the righteous,
011350 and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.'
011351 Jesus saith to them, 'Did ye understand all these?' They say to him, 'Yes, sir.'
011352 And he said to them, 'Because of this every scribe having been discipled in regard to the reign of the heavens, is like to a man, a householder, who doth bring forth out of his treasure things new and old.'
011353 And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these similes, he removed thence,
011354 and having come to his own country, he was teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and were saying, 'Whence to this one this wisdom and the mighty works?
011355 is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
011356 and his sisters -- are they not all with us? whence, then, to this one all these?'
011357 and they were stumbled at him. And Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, and in his own house:'
011358 and he did not there many mighty works, because of their unbelief.
011401 At that time did Herod the tetrarch hear the fame of Jesus,
011402 and said to his servants, 'This is John the Baptist, he did rise from the dead, and because of this the mighty energies are working in him.'
011403 For Herod having laid hold on John, did bind him, and did put him in prison, because of Herodias his brother Philip's wife,
011404 for John was saying to him, 'It is not lawful to thee to have her,'
011405 and, willing to kill him, he feared the multitude, because as a prophet they were holding him.
011406 But the birthday of Herod being kept, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and did please Herod,
011407 whereupon with an oath he professed to give her whatever she might ask.
011408 And she having been instigated by her mother -- 'Give me (says she) here upon a plate the head of John the Baptist;
011409 and the king was grieved, but because of the oaths and of those reclining with him, he commanded [it] to be given;
011410 and having sent, he beheaded John in the prison,
011411 and his head was brought upon a plate, and was given to the damsel, and she brought [it] nigh to her mother.
011412 And his disciples having come, took up the body, and buried it, and having come, they told Jesus,
011413 and Jesus having heard, withdrew thence in a boat to a desolate place by himself, and the multitudes having heard did follow him on land from the cities.
011414 And Jesus having come forth, saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion upon them, and did heal their infirm;
011415 and evening having come, his disciples came to him, saying, 'The place is desolate, and the hour hath now past, let away the multitudes that, having gone to the villages, they may buy to themselves food.'
011416 And Jesus said to them, 'They have no need to go away -- give ye them to eat.'
011417 And they say to him, 'We have not here except five loaves, and two fishes.'
011418 And he said, 'Bring ye them to me hither.'
011419 And having commanded the multitudes to recline upon the grass, and having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, having looked up to the heaven, he did bless, and having broken, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes,
011420 and they did all eat, and were filled, and they took up what was over of the broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full;
011421 and those eating were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.
011422 And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, till he might let away the multitudes;
011423 and having let away the multitudes, he went up to the mountain by himself to pray, and evening having come, he was there alone,
011424 and the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
011425 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went away to them, walking upon the sea,
011426 and the disciples having seen him walking upon the sea, were troubled saying -- 'It is an apparition,' and from the fear they cried out;
011427 and immediately Jesus spake to them, saying, 'Be of good courage, I am [he], be not afraid.'
011428 And Peter answering him said, 'Sir, if it is thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters;'
011429 and he said, 'Come;' and having gone down from the boat, Peter walked upon the waters to come unto Jesus,
011430 but seeing the wind vehement, he was afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out, saying, 'Sir, save me.'
011431 And immediately Jesus, having stretched forth the hand, laid hold of him, and saith to him, 'Little faith! for what didst thou waver?'
011432 and they having gone to the boat the wind lulled,
011433 and those in the boat having come, did bow to him, saying, 'Truly -- God's Son art thou.'
011434 And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret,
011435 and having recognized him, the men of that place sent forth to all that region round about, and they brought to him all who were ill,
011436 and were calling on him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment, and as many as did touch were saved.
011501 Then come unto Jesus do they from Jerusalem -- scribes and Pharisees -- saying,
011502 'Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they may eat bread.'
011503 And he answering said to them, 'Wherefore also do ye transgress the command of God because of your tradition?
011504 for God did command, saying, Honour thy father and mother; and, He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death;
011505 but ye say, Whoever may say to father or mother, An offering [is] whatever thou mayest be profited by me; --
011506 and he may not honour his father or his mother, and ye did set aside the command of God because of your tradition.
011507 'Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
011508 This people doth draw nigh to Me with their mouth, and with the lips it doth honour Me, but their heart is far off from Me;
011509 and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings -- commands of men.'
011510 And having called near the multitude, he said to them, 'Hear and understand:
011511 not that which is coming into the mouth doth defile the man, but that which is coming forth from the mouth, this defileth the man.'
011512 Then his disciples having come near, said to him, 'Hast thou known that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were stumbled?'
011513 And he answering said, 'Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant shall be rooted up;
011514 let them alone, guides they are -- blind of blind; and if blind may guide blind, both into a ditch shall fall.'
011515 And Peter answering said to him, 'Explain to us this simile.'
011516 And Jesus said, 'Are ye also yet without understanding?
011517 do ye not understand that all that is going into the mouth doth pass into the belly, and into the drain is cast forth?
011518 but the things coming forth from the mouth from the heart do come forth, and these defile the man;
011519 for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false witnessings, evil speakings:
011520 these are the things defiling the man; but to eat with unwashen hands doth not defile the man.'
011521 And Jesus having come forth thence, withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon,
011522 and lo, a woman, a Canaanitess, from those borders having come forth, did call to him, saying, 'Deal kindly with me, Sir -- Son of David; my daughter is miserably demonized.'
011523 And he did not answer her a word; and his disciples having come to him, were asking him, saying -- 'Let her away, because she crieth after us;'
011524 and he answering said, 'I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'
011525 And having come, she was bowing to him, saying, 'Sir, help me;'
011526 and he answering said, 'It is not good to take the children's bread, and to cast to the little dogs.'
011527 And she said, 'Yes, sir, for even the little dogs do eat of the crumbs that are falling from their lords' table;'
011528 then answering, Jesus said to her, 'O woman, great [is] thy faith, let it be to thee as thou wilt;' and her daughter was healed from that hour.
011529 And Jesus having passed thence, came nigh unto the sea of Galilee, and having gone up to the mountain, he was sitting there,
011530 and there came to him great multitudes, having with them lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they did cast them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them,
011531 so that the multitudes did wonder, seeing dumb ones speaking, maimed whole, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
011532 And Jesus having called near his disciples, said, 'I have compassion upon the multitude, because now three days they continue with me, and they have not what they may eat; and to let them away fasting I will not, lest they faint in the way.'
011533 And his disciples say to him, 'Whence to us, in a wilderness, so many loaves, as to fill so great a multitude?'
011534 And Jesus saith to them, 'How many loaves have ye?' and they said, 'Seven, and a few little fishes.'
011535 And he commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the ground,
011536 and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having given thanks, he did break, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
011537 And they did all eat, and were filled, and they took up what was over of the broken pieces seven baskets full,
011538 and those eating were four thousand men, apart from women and children.
011539 And having let away the multitudes, he went into the boat, and did come to the borders of Magdala.
011601 And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come, tempting, did question him, to shew to them a sign from the heaven,
011602 and he answering said to them, 'Evening having come, ye say, Fair weather, for the heaven is red,
011603 and at morning, Foul weather to-day, for the heaven is red -- gloomy; hypocrites, the face of the heavens indeed ye do know to discern, but the signs of the times ye are not able!
011604 'A generation evil and adulterous doth seek a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet;' and having left them he went away.
011605 And his disciples having come to the other side, forgot to take loaves,
011606 and Jesus said to them, 'Beware, and take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees;'
011607 and they were reasoning in themselves, saying, 'Because we took no loaves.'
011608 And Jesus having known, said to them, 'Why reason ye in yourselves, ye of little faith, because ye took no loaves?
011609 do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many hand-baskets ye took up?
011610 nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
011611 how do ye not understand that I did not speak to you of bread -- to take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?'
011612 Then they understood that he did not say to take heed of the leaven of the bread, but of the teaching, of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
011613 And Jesus, having come to the parts of Cesarea Philippi, was asking his disciples, saying, 'Who do men say me to be -- the Son of Man?'
011614 and they said, 'Some, John the Baptist, and others, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.'
011615 He saith to them, 'And ye -- who do ye say me to be?'
011616 and Simon Peter answering said, 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.'
011617 And Jesus answering said to him, 'Happy art thou, Simon Bar-Jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal [it] to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.
011618 'And I also say to thee, that thou art a rock, and upon this rock I will build my assembly, and gates of Hades shall not prevail against it;
011619 and I will give to thee the keys of the reign of the heavens, and whatever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be having been bound in the heavens, and whatever thou mayest loose upon the earth shall be having been loosed in the heavens.'
011620 Then did he charge his disciples that they may say to no one that he is Jesus the Christ.
011621 From that time began Jesus to shew to his disciples that it is necessary for him to go away to Jerusalem, and to suffer many things from the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and to be put to death, and the third day to rise.
011622 And having taken him aside, Peter began to rebuke him, saying, 'Be kind to thyself, sir; this shall not be to thee;'
011623 and he having turned, said to Peter, 'Get thee behind me, adversary! thou art a stumbling-block to me, for thou dost not mind the things of God, but the things of men.'
011624 Then said Jesus to his disciples, 'If any one doth will to come after me, let him disown himself, and take up his cross, and follow me,
011625 for whoever may will to save his life, shall lose it, and whoever may lose his life for my sake shall find it,
011626 for what is a man profited if he may gain the whole world, but of his life suffer loss? or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life?
011627 'For, the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of his Father, with his messengers, and then he will reward each, according to his work.
011628 Verily I say to you, there are certain of those standing here who shall not taste of death till they may see the Son of Man coming in his reign.'
011701 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John his brother, and doth bring them up to a high mount by themselves,
011702 and he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his garments did become white as the light,
011703 and lo, appear to them did Moses and Elijah, talking together with him.
011704 And Peter answering said to Jesus, 'Sir, it is good to us to be here; if thou wilt, we may make here three booths -- for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elijah.'
011705 While he is yet speaking, lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, 'This is My Son, -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight; hear him.'
011706 And the disciples having heard, did fall upon their face, and were exceedingly afraid,
011707 and Jesus having come near, touched them, and said, 'Rise, be not afraid,'
011708 and having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus only.
011709 And as they are coming down from the mount, Jesus charged them, saying, 'Say to no one the vision, till the Son of Man out of the dead may rise.'
011710 And his disciples questioned him, saying, 'Why then do the scribes say that Elijah it behoveth to come first?'
011711 And Jesus answering said to them, 'Elijah doth indeed come first, and shall restore all things,
011712 and I say to you -- Elijah did already come, and they did not know him, but did with him whatever they would, so also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.'
011713 Then understood the disciples that concerning John the Baptist he spake to them.
011714 And when they came unto the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling down to him,
011715 and saying, 'Sir, deal kindly with my son, for he is lunatic, and doth suffer miserably, for often he doth fall into the fire, and often into the water,
011716 and I brought him near to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him.'
011717 And Jesus answering said, 'O generation, unstedfast and perverse, till when shall I be with you? till when shall I bear you? bring him to me hither;'
011718 and Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out of him, and the lad was healed from that hour.
011719 Then the disciples having come to Jesus by himself, said, 'Wherefore were we not able to cast him out?'
011720 And Jesus said to them, 'Through your want of faith; for verily I say to you, if ye may have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this mount, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible to you,
011721 and this kind doth not go forth except in prayer and fasting.'
011722 And while they are living in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men,
011723 and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise,' and they were exceeding sorry.
011724 And they having come to Capernaum, those receiving the didrachms came near to Peter, and said, 'Your teacher -- doth he not pay the didrachms?' He saith, 'Yes.'
011725 And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, 'What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth -- from whom do they receive custom or poll-tax? from their sons or from the strangers?'
011726 Peter saith to him, 'From the strangers.' Jesus said to him, 'Then are the sons free;
011727 but, that we may not cause them to stumble, having gone to the sea, cast a hook, and the fish that hath come up first take thou up, and having opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater, that having taken, give to them for me and thee.'
011801 At that hour came the disciples near to Jesus, saying, 'Who, now, is greater in the reign of the heavens?'
011802 And Jesus having called near a child, did set him in the midst of them,
011803 and said, 'Verily I say to you, if ye may not be turned and become as the children, ye may not enter into the reign of the heavens;
011804 whoever then may humble himself as this child, he is the greater in the reign of the heavens.
011805 'And he who may receive one such child in my name, doth receive me,
011806 and whoever may cause to stumble one of those little ones who are believing in me, it is better for him that a weighty millstone may be hanged upon his neck, and he may be sunk in the depth of the sea.
011807 'Wo to the world from the stumbling-blocks! for there is a necessity for the stumbling-blocks to come, but wo to that man through whom the stumbling-block doth come!
011808 'And if thy hand or thy foot doth cause thee to stumble, cut them off and cast from thee; it is good for thee to enter into the life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast to the fire the age-during.
011809 'And if thine eye doth cause thee to stumble, pluck it out and cast from thee; it is good for thee one-eyed to enter into the life, rather than having two eyes to be cast to the gehenna of the fire.
011810 'Beware! -- ye may not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you, that their messengers in the heavens do always behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens,
011811 for the Son of Man did come to save the lost.
011812 'What think ye? if a man may have an hundred sheep, and there may go astray one of them, doth he not -- having left the ninety-nine, having gone on the mountains -- seek that which is gone astray?
011813 and if it may come to pass that he doth find it, verily I say to you, that he doth rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray;
011814 so it is not will in presence of your Father who is in the heavens, that one of these little ones may perish.
011815 'And if thy brother may sin against thee, go and show him his fault between thee and him alone, if he may hear thee, thou didst gain thy brother;
011816 and if he may not hear, take with thee yet one or two, that by the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may stand.
011817 'And if he may not hear them, say [it] to the assembly, and if also the assembly he may not hear, let him be to thee as the heathen man and the tax-gatherer.
011818 'Verily I say to you, Whatever things ye may bind upon the earth shall be having been bound in the heavens, and whatever things ye may loose on the earth shall be having been loosed in the heavens.
011819 'Again, I say to you, that, if two of you may agree on the earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask -- it shall be done to them from my Father who is in the heavens,
011820 for where there are two or three gathered together -- to my name, there am I in the midst of them.'
011821 Then Peter having come near to him, said, 'Sir, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him -- till seven times?'
011822 Jesus saith to him, 'I do not say to thee till seven times, but till seventy times seven.
011823 'Because of this was the reign of the heavens likened to a man, a king, who did will to take reckoning with his servants,
011824 and he having begun to take account, there was brought near to him one debtor of a myriad of talents,
011825 and he having nothing to pay, his lord did command him to be sold, and his wife, and the children, and all, whatever he had, and payment to be made.
011826 The servant then, having fallen down, was bowing to him, saying, Sir, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all;
011827 and the lord of that servant having been moved with compassion did release him, and the debt he forgave him.
011828 'And, that servant having come forth, found one of his fellow-servants who was owing him an hundred denaries, and having laid hold, he took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that which thou owest.
011829 His fellow-servant then, having fallen down at his feet, was calling on him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all;
011830 and he would not, but having gone away, he cast him into prison, till he might pay that which was owing.
011831 'And his fellow-servants having seen the things that were done, were grieved exceedingly, and having come, shewed fully to their lord all the things that were done;
011832 then having called him, his lord saith to him, Evil servant! all that debt I did forgive thee, seeing thou didst call upon me,
011833 did it not behove also thee to have dealt kindly with thy fellow-servant, as I also dealt kindly with thee?
011834 'And having been wroth, his lord delivered him to the inquisitors, till he might pay all that was owing to him;
011835 so also my heavenly Father will do to you, if ye may not forgive each one his brother from your hearts their trespasses.'
011901 And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these words, he removed from Galilee, and did come to the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan,
011902 and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
011903 And the Pharisees came near to him, tempting him, and saying to him, 'Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?'
011904 And he answering said to them, 'Did ye not read, that He who made [them], from the beginning a male and a female made them,
011905 and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh?
011906 so that they are no more two, but one flesh; what therefore God did join together, let no man put asunder.'
011907 They say to him, 'Why then did Moses command to give a roll of divorce, and to put her away?'
011908 He saith to them -- 'Moses for your stiffness of heart did suffer you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it hath not been so.
011909 'And I say to you, that, whoever may put away his wife, if not for whoredom, and may marry another, doth commit adultery; and he who did marry her that hath been put away, doth commit adultery.'
011910 His disciples say to him, 'If the case of the man with the woman is so, it is not good to marry.'
011911 And he said to them, 'All do not receive this word, but those to whom it hath been given;
011912 for there are eunuchs who from the mother's womb were so born; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who kept themselves eunuchs because of the reign of the heavens: he who is able to receive [it] -- let him receive.'
011913 Then were brought near to him children that he might put hands on them and pray, and the disciples rebuked them.
011914 But Jesus said, 'Suffer the children, and forbid them not, to come unto me, for of such is the reign of the heavens;'
011915 and having laid on them [his] hands, he departed thence.
011916 And lo, one having come near, said to him, 'Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have life age-during?'
011917 And he said to him, 'Why me dost thou call good? no one [is] good except One -- God; but if thou dost will to enter into the life, keep the commands.'
011918 He saith to him, 'What kind?' And Jesus said, 'Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness,
011919 honour thy father and mother, and, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'
011920 The young man saith to him, 'All these did I keep from my youth; what yet do I lack?'
011921 Jesus said to him, 'If thou dost will to be perfect, go away, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.'
011922 And the young man, having heard the word, went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions;
011923 and Jesus said to his disciples, 'Verily I say to you, that hardly shall a rich man enter into the reign of the heavens;
011924 and again I say to you, it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to go, than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God.'
011925 And his disciples having heard, were amazed exceedingly, saying, 'Who, then, is able to be saved?'
011926 And Jesus having earnestly beheld, said to them, 'With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.'
011927 Then Peter answering said to him, 'Lo, we did leave all, and follow thee, what then shall we have?'
011928 And Jesus said to them, 'Verily I say to you, that ye who did follow me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man may sit upon a throne of his glory, shall sit -- ye also -- upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel;
011929 and every one who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for my name's sake, an hundredfold shall receive, and life age-during shall inherit;
011930 and many first shall be last, and last first.
012001 'For the reign of the heavens is like to a man, a householder, who went forth with the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard,
012002 and having agreed with the workmen for a denary a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
012003 'And having gone forth about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle,
012004 and to these he said, Go ye -- also ye -- to the vineyard, and whatever may be righteous I will give you;
012005 and they went away. 'Again, having gone forth about the sixth and the ninth hour, he did in like manner.
012006 And about the eleventh hour, having gone forth, he found others standing idle, and saith to them, Why here have ye stood all the day idle?
012007 they say to him, Because no one did hire us; he saith to them, Go ye -- ye also -- to the vineyard, and whatever may be righteous ye shall receive.
012008 'And evening having come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the workmen, and pay them the reward, having begun from the last -- unto the first.
012009 And they of about the eleventh hour having come, did receive each a denary.
012010 'And the first having come, did suppose that they shall receive more, and they received, they also, each a denary,
012011 and having received [it], they were murmuring against the householder, saying,
012012 that These, the last, wrought one hour, and thou didst make them equal to us, who were bearing the burden of the day -- and the heat.
012013 'And he answering said to one of them, Comrade, I do no unrighteousness to thee; for a denary didst not thou agree with me?
012014 take that which is thine, and go; and I will to give to this, the last, also as to thee;
012015 is it not lawful to me to do what I will in mine own? is thine eye evil because I am good?
012016 So the last shall be first, and the first last, for many are called, and few chosen.'
012017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples by themselves in the way, and said to them,
012018 'Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes,
012019 and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the nations to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify, and the third day he will rise again.'
012020 Then came near to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing and asking something from him,
012021 and he said to her, 'What wilt thou?' She saith to him, 'Say, that they may sit -- these my two sons -- one on thy right hand, and one on the left, in thy reign.'
012022 And Jesus answering said, 'Ye have not known what ye ask for yourselves; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink? and with the baptism that I am baptized with, to be baptized?' They say to him, 'We are able.'
012023 And he saith to them, 'Of my cup indeed ye shall drink, and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared by my father.'
012024 And the ten having heard, were much displeased with the two brothers,
012025 and Jesus having called them near, said, 'Ye have known that the rulers of the nations do exercise lordship over them, and those great do exercise authority over them,
012026 but not so shall it be among you, but whoever may will among you to become great, let him be your ministrant;
012027 and whoever may will among you to be first, let him be your servant;
012028 even as the Son of Man did not come to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.'
012029 And they going forth from Jericho, there followed him a great multitude,
012030 and lo, two blind men sitting by the way, having heard that Jesus doth pass by, cried, saying, 'Deal kindly with us, sir -- Son of David.'
012031 And the multitude charged them that they might be silent, and they cried out the more, saying, 'Deal kindly with us sir -- Son of David.'
012032 And having stood, Jesus called them, and said, 'What will ye [that] I may do to you?'
012033 they say to him, 'Sir, that our eyes may be opened;'
012034 and having been moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
012101 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, unto the mount of the Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
012102 saying to them, 'Go on to the village over-against you, and immediately ye shall find an ass bound, and a colt with her -- having loosed, bring ye to me;
012103 and if any one may say anything to you, ye shall say, that the lord hath need of them, and immediately he will send them.'
012104 And all this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophet, saying,
012105 'Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Lo, thy king doth come to thee, meek, and mounted on an ass, and a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.'
012106 And the disciples having gone and having done as Jesus commanded them,
012107 brought the ass and the colt, and did put on them their garments, and set [him] upon them;
012108 and the very great multitude spread their own garments in the way, and others were cutting branches from the trees, and were strewing in the way,
012109 and the multitudes who were going before, and who were following, were crying, saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.'
012110 And he having entered into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, 'Who is this?'
012111 And the multitudes said, 'This is Jesus the prophet, who [is] from Nazareth of Galilee.'
012112 And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and did cast forth all those selling and buying in the temple, and the tables of the money-changers he overturned, and the seats of those selling the doves,
012113 and he saith to them, 'It hath been written, My house a house of prayer shall be called, but ye did make it a den of robbers.'
012114 And there came to him blind and lame men in the temple, and he healed them,
012115 and the chief priests and the scribes having seen the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David,' were much displeased;
012116 and they said to him, 'Hearest thou what these say?' And Jesus saith to them, 'Yes, did ye never read, that, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou didst prepare praise?'
012117 And having left them, he went forth out of the city to Bethany, and did lodge there,
012118 and in the morning turning back to the city, he hungered,
012119 and having seen a certain fig-tree on the way, he came to it, and found nothing in it except leaves only, and he saith to it, 'No more from thee may fruit be -- to the age;' and forthwith the fig-tree withered.
012120 And the disciples having seen, did wonder, saying, 'How did the fig-tree forthwith wither?'
012121 And Jesus answering said to them, 'Verily I say to you, If ye may have faith, and may not doubt, not only this of the fig-tree shall ye do, but even if to this mount ye may say, Be lifted up and be cast into the sea, it shall come to pass;
012122 and all -- as much as ye may ask in the prayer, believing, ye shall receive.'
012123 And he having come to the temple, there came to him when teaching the chief priests and the elders of the people, saying, 'By what authority dost thou do these things? and who gave thee this authority?'
012124 And Jesus answering said to them, 'I will ask you -- I also -- one word, which if ye may tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things;
012125 the baptism of John, whence was it? -- from heaven, or from men?' And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, 'If we should say, From heaven; he will say to us, Wherefore, then, did ye not believe him?
012126 and if we should say, From men, we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.'
012127 And answering Jesus they said, 'We have not known.' He said to them -- he also -- 'Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
012128 'And what think ye? A man had two children, and having come to the first, he said, Child, go, to-day be working in my vineyard.'
012129 And he answering said, 'I will not,' but at last, having repented, he went.
012130 'And having come to the second, he said in the same manner, and he answering said, I [go], sir, and went not;
012131 which of the two did the will of the father?' They say to him, 'The first.' Jesus saith to them, 'Verily I say to you, that the tax-gatherers and the harlots do go before you into the reign of God,
012132 for John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye did not believe him, and the tax-gatherers and the harlots did believe him, and ye, having seen, repented not at last -- to believe him.
012133 'Hear ye another simile: There was a certain man, a householder, who planted a vineyard, and did put a hedge round it, and digged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.
012134 'And when the season of the fruits came nigh, he sent his servants unto the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it,
012135 and the husbandmen having taken his servants, one they scourged, and one they killed, and one they stoned.
012136 'Again he sent other servants more than the first, and they did to them in the same manner.
012137 'And at last he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son;
012138 and the husbandmen having seen the son, said among themselves, This is the heir, come, we may kill him, and may possess his inheritance;
012139 and having taken him, they cast [him] out of the vineyard, and killed him;
012140 whenever therefore the lord of the vineyard may come, what will he do to these husbandmen?'
012141 They say to him, 'Evil men -- he will evilly destroy them, and the vineyard will give out to other husbandmen, who will give back to him the fruits in their seasons.'
012142 Jesus saith to them, 'Did ye never read in the Writings, A stone that the builders disallowed, it became head of a corner; from the Lord hath this come to pass, and it is wonderful in our eyes.
012143 'Because of this I say to you, that the reign of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth its fruit;
012144 and he who is falling on this stone shall be broken, and on whomsoever it may fall it will crush him to pieces.'
012145 And the chief priests and the Pharisees having heard his similes, knew that of them he speaketh,
012146 and seeking to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, seeing they were holding him as a prophet.
012201 And Jesus answering, again spake to them in similes, saying,
012202 'The reign of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made marriage-feasts for his son,
012203 and he sent forth his servants to call those having been called to the marriage-feasts, and they were not willing to come.
012204 'Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Say to those who have been called: Lo, my dinner I prepared, my oxen and the fatlings have been killed, and all things [are] ready, come ye to the marriage-feasts;
012205 and they, having disregarded [it], went away, the one to his own field, and the other to his merchandise;
012206 and the rest, having laid hold on his servants, did insult and slay [them].
012207 'And the king having heard, was wroth, and having sent forth his soldiers, he destroyed those murderers, and their city he set on fire;
012208 then saith he to his servants, The marriage-feast indeed is ready, and those called were not worthy,
012209 be going, then, on to the cross-ways, and as many as ye may find, call ye to the marriage-feasts.
012210 'And those servants, having gone forth to the ways, did gather all, as many as they found, both bad and good, and the marriage-feast apartment was filled with those reclining.
012211 'And the king having come in to view those reclining, saw there a man not clothed with clothing of the marriage-feast,
012212 and he saith to him, Comrade, how didst thou come in hither, not having clothing of the marriage-feast? and he was speechless.
012213 'Then said the king to the ministrants, Having bound his feet and hands, take him up and cast forth to the outer darkness, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth;
012214 for many are called, and few chosen.'
012215 Then the Pharisees having gone, took counsel how they might ensnare him in words,
012216 and they send to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, 'Teacher, we have known that thou art true, and the way of God in truth thou dost teach, and thou art not caring for any one, for thou dost not look to the face of men;
012217 tell us, therefore, what dost thou think? is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?'
012218 And Jesus having known their wickedness, said, 'Why me do ye tempt, hypocrites?
012219 show me the tribute-coin?' and they brought to him a denary;
012220 and he saith to them, 'Whose [is] this image and the inscription?'
012221 they say to him, 'Caesar's;' then saith he to them, 'Render therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;'
012222 and having heard they wondered, and having left him they went away.
012223 In that day there came near to him Sadducees, who are saying there is not a rising again, and they questioned him, saying,
012224 'Teacher, Moses said, If any one may die not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and shall raise up seed to his brother.
012225 'And there were with us seven brothers, and the first having married did die, and not having seed, he left his wife to his brother;
012226 in like manner also the second, and the third, unto the seventh,
012227 and last of all died also the woman;
012228 therefore in the rising again, of which of the seven shall she be wife -- for all had her?'
012229 And Jesus answering said to them, 'Ye go astray, not knowing the Writings, nor the power of God;
012230 for in the rising again they do not marry, nor are they given in marriage, but are as messengers of God in heaven.
012231 'And concerning the rising again of the dead, did ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
012232 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not a God of dead men, but of living.'
012233 And having heard, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching;
012234 and the Pharisees, having heard that he did silence the Sadducees, were gathered together unto him;
012235 and one of them, a lawyer, did question, tempting him, and saying,
012236 'Teacher, which [is] the great command in the Law?'
012237 And Jesus said to him, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding --
012238 this is a first and great command;
012239 and the second [is] like to it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;
012240 on these -- the two commands -- all the law and the prophets do hang.'
012241 And the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus did question them,
012242 saying, 'What do ye think concerning the Christ? of whom is he son?' They say to him, 'Of David.'
012243 He saith to them, 'How then doth David in the Spirit call him lord, saying,
012244 The Lord said to my lord, Sit at my right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?
012245 If then David doth call him lord, how is he his son?'
012246 And no one was able to answer him a word, nor durst any from that day question him any more.
012301 Then Jesus spake to the multitudes, and to his disciples,
012302 saying, 'On the seat of Moses sat down the scribes and the Pharisees;
012303 all, then, as much as they may say to you to observe, observe and do, but according to their works do not, for they say, and do not;
012304 for they bind together burdens heavy and grievous to be borne, and lay upon the shoulders of men, but with their finger they will not move them.
012305 'And all their works they do to be seen by men, and they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the fringes of their garments,
012306 they love also the chief couches in the supper, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
012307 and the salutations in the market-places, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
012308 'And ye -- ye may not be called Rabbi, for one is your director -- the Christ, and all ye are brethren;
012309 and ye may not call [any] your father on the earth, for one is your Father, who is in the heavens,
012310 nor may ye be called directors, for one is your director -- the Christ.
012311 And the greater of you shall be your ministrant,
012312 and whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled, and whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.
012313 'Wo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut up the reign of the heavens before men, for ye do not go in, nor those going in do ye suffer to enter.
012314 'Wo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye eat up the houses of the widows, and for a pretence make long prayers, because of this ye shall receive more abundant judgment.
012315 'Wo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye go round the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte, and whenever it may happen -- ye make him a son of gehenna twofold more than yourselves.
012316 'Wo to you, blind guides, who are saying, Whoever may swear by the sanctuary, it is nothing, but whoever may swear by the gold of the sanctuary -- is debtor!
012317 Fools and blind! for which [is] greater, the gold, or the sanctuary that is sanctifying the gold?
012318 'And, whoever may swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever may swear by the gift that is upon it -- is debtor!
012319 Fools and blind! for which [is] greater, the gift, or the altar that is sanctifying the gift?
012320 'He therefore who did swear by the altar, doth swear by it, and by all things on it;
012321 and he who did swear by the sanctuary, doth swear by it, and by Him who is dwelling in it;
012322 and he who did swear by the heaven, doth swear by the throne of God, and by Him who is sitting upon it.
012323 'Wo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye give tithe of the mint, and the dill, and the cumin, and did neglect the weightier things of the Law -- the judgment, and the kindness, and the faith; these it behoved [you] to do, and those not to neglect.
012324 'Blind guides! who are straining out the gnat, and the camel are swallowing.
012325 'Wo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye make clean the outside of the cup and the plate, and within they are full of rapine and incontinence.
012326 'Blind Pharisee! cleanse first the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside of them also may become clean.
012327 'Wo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye are like to whitewashed sepulchres, which outwardly indeed do appear beautiful, and within are full of bones of dead men, and of all uncleanness;
012328 so also ye outwardly indeed do appear to men righteous, and within ye are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
012329 'Wo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and adorn the tombs of the righteous,
012330 and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
012331 So that ye testify to yourselves, that ye are sons of them who did murder the prophets;
012332 and ye -- ye fill up the measure of your fathers.
012333 'Serpents! brood of vipers! how may ye escape from the judgment of the gehenna?
012334 'Because of this, lo, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes, and of them ye will kill and crucify, and of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and will pursue from city to city;
012335 that on you may come all the righteous blood being poured out on the earth from the blood of Abel the righteous, unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar:
012336 verily I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
012337 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that art killing the prophets, and stoning those sent unto thee, how often did I will to gather thy children together, as a hen doth gather her own chickens under the wings, and ye did not will.
012338 Lo, left desolate to you is your house;
012339 for I say to you, ye may not see me henceforth, till ye may say, Blessed [is] he who is coming in the name of the Lord.'
012401 And having gone forth, Jesus departed from the temple, and his disciples came near to show him the buildings of the temple,
012402 and Jesus said to them, 'Do ye not see all these? verily I say to you, There may not be left here a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.'
012403 And when he is sitting on the mount of the Olives, the disciples came near to him by himself, saying, 'Tell us, when shall these be? and what [is] the sign of thy presence, and of the full end of the age?'
012404 And Jesus answering said to them, 'Take heed that no one may lead you astray,
012405 for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and they shall lead many astray,
012406 and ye shall begin to hear of wars, and reports of wars; see, be not troubled, for it behoveth all [these] to come to pass, but the end is not yet.
012407 'For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places;
012408 and all these [are] the beginning of sorrows;
012409 then they shall deliver you up to tribulation, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated by all the nations because of my name;
012410 and then shall many be stumbled, and they shall deliver up one another, and shall hate one another.
012411 'And many false prophets shall arise, and shall lead many astray;
012412 and because of the abounding of the lawlessness, the love of the many shall become cold;
012413 but he who did endure to the end, he shall be saved;
012414 and this good news of the reign shall be proclaimed in all the world, for a testimony to all the nations; and then shall the end arrive.
012415 'Whenever, therefore, ye may see the abomination of the desolation, that was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (whoever is reading let him observe)
012416 then those in Judea -- let them flee to the mounts;
012417 he on the house-top -- let him not come down to take up any thing out of his house;
012418 and he in the field -- let him not turn back to take his garments.
012419 'And wo to those with child, and to those giving suck in those days;
012420 and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a sabbath;
012421 for there shall be then great tribulation, such as was not from the beginning of the world till now, no, nor may be.
012422 And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would have been saved; but because of the chosen, shall those days be shortened.
012423 'Then if any one may say to you, Lo, here [is] the Christ! or here! ye may not believe;
012424 for there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and they shall give great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, also the chosen.
012425 Lo, I did tell you beforehand.
012426 'If therefore they may say to you, Lo, in the wilderness he is, ye may not go forth; lo, in the inner chambers, ye may not believe;
012427 for as the lightning doth come forth from the east, and doth appear unto the west, so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man;
012428 for wherever the carcase may be, there shall the eagles be gathered together.
012429 'And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken;
012430 and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth smite the breast, and they shall see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of the heaven, with power and much glory;
012431 and he shall send his messengers with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens unto the ends thereof.
012432 'And from the fig-tree learn ye the simile: When already its branch may have become tender, and the leaves it may put forth, ye know that summer [is] nigh,
012433 so also ye, when ye may see all these, ye know that it is nigh -- at the doors.
012434 Verily I say to you, this generation may not pass away till all these may come to pass.
012435 The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
012436 'And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known -- not even the messengers of the heavens -- except my Father only;
012437 and as the days of Noah -- so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man;
012438 for as they were, in the days before the flood, eating, and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, till the day Noah entered into the ark,
012439 and they did not know till the flood came and took all away; so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man.
012440 Then two men shall be in the field, the one is received, and the one is left;
012441 two women shall be grinding in the mill, one is received, and one is left.
012442 'Watch ye therefore, because ye have not known in what hour your Lord doth come;
012443 and this know, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief doth come, he had watched, and not suffered his house to be broken through;
012444 because of this also ye, become ye ready, because in what hour ye do not think, the Son of Man doth come.
012445 'Who, then, is the servant, faithful and wise, whom his lord did set over his household, to give them the nourishment in season?
012446 Happy that servant, whom his lord, having come, shall find doing so;
012447 verily I say to you, that over all his substance he will set him.
012448 'And, if that evil servant may say in his heart, My Lord doth delay to come,
012449 and may begin to beat the fellow-servants, and to eat and to drink with the drunken,
012450 the lord of that servant will arrive in a day when he doth not expect, and in an hour of which he doth not know,
012451 and will cut him off, and his portion with the hypocrites will appoint; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
012501 'Then shall the reign of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who, having taken their lamps, went forth to meet the bridegroom;
012502 and five of them were prudent, and five foolish;
012503 they who were foolish having taken their lamps, did not take with themselves oil;
012504 and the prudent took oil in their vessels, with their lamps.
012505 'And the bridegroom tarrying, they all nodded and were sleeping,
012506 and in the middle of the night a cry was made, Lo, the bridegroom doth come; go ye forth to meet him.
012507 'Then rose all those virgins, and trimmed their lamps,
012508 and the foolish said to the prudent, Give us of your oil, because our lamps are going out;
012509 and the prudent answered, saying -- Lest there may not be sufficient for us and you, go ye rather unto those selling, and buy for yourselves.
012510 'And while they are going away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those ready went in with him to the marriage-feasts, and the door was shut;
012511 and afterwards come also do the rest of the virgins, saying, Sir, sir, open to us;
012512 and he answering said, Verily I say to you, I have not known you.
012513 'Watch therefore, for ye have not known the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man doth come.
012514 'For -- as a man going abroad did call his own servants, and did deliver to them his substance,
012515 and to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his several ability, went abroad immediately.
012516 'And he who did receive the five talents, having gone, wrought with them, and made other five talents;
012517 in like manner also he who [received] the two, he gained, also he, other two;
012518 and he who did receive the one, having gone away, digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
012519 'And after a long time cometh the lord of those servants, and taketh reckoning with them;
012520 and he who did receive the five talents having come, brought other five talents, saying, 'Sir, five talents thou didst deliver to me; lo, other five talents did I gain besides them.
012521 'And his lord said to him, Well done, servant, good and faithful, over a few things thou wast faithful, over many things I will set thee; enter into the joy of thy lord.
012522 'And he who also did receive the two talents having come, said, Sir, two talents thou didst deliver to me; lo, other two talents I did gain besides them.
012523 'His lord said to him, Well done, servant, good and faithful, over a few things thou wast faithful, over many things I will set thee; enter into the joy of thy lord.
012524 'And he also who hath received the one talent having come, said, Sir, I knew thee, that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering from whence thou didst not scatter;
012525 and having been afraid, having gone away, I hid thy talent in the earth; lo, thou hast thine own!
012526 'And his lord answering said to him, Evil servant, and slothful, thou hadst known that I reap where I did not sow, and I gather whence I did not scatter!
012527 it behoved thee then to put my money to the money-lenders, and having come I had received mine own with increase.
012528 'Take therefore from him the talent, and give to him having the ten talents,
012529 for to every one having shall be given, and he shall have overabundance, and from him who is not having, even that which he hath shall be taken from him;
012530 and the unprofitable servant cast ye forth to the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
012531 'And whenever the Son of Man may come in his glory, and all the holy messengers with him, then he shall sit upon a throne of his glory;
012532 and gathered together before him shall be all the nations, and he shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd doth separate the sheep from the goats,
012533 and he shall set the sheep indeed on his right hand, and the goats on the left.
012534 'Then shall the king say to those on his right hand, Come ye, the blessed of my Father, inherit the reign that hath been prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
012535 for I did hunger, and ye gave me to eat; I did thirst, and ye gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and ye received me;
012536 naked, and ye put around me; I was infirm, and ye looked after me; in prison I was, and ye came unto me.
012537 'Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungering, and we nourished? or thirsting, and we gave to drink?
012538 and when did we see thee a stranger, and we received? or naked, and we put around?
012539 and when did we see thee infirm, or in prison, and we came unto thee?
012540 'And the king answering, shall say to them, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] to one of these my brethren -- the least -- to me ye did [it].
012541 Then shall he say also to those on the left hand, Go ye from me, the cursed, to the fire, the age-during, that hath been prepared for the Devil and his messengers;
012542 for I did hunger, and ye gave me not to eat; I did thirst, and ye gave me not to drink;
012543 a stranger I was, and ye did not receive me; naked, and ye put not around me; infirm, and in prison, and ye did not look after me.
012544 'Then shall they answer, they also, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or infirm, or in prison, and we did not minister to thee?
012545 'Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of these, the least, ye did [it] not to me.
012546 And these shall go away to punishment age-during, but the righteous to life age-during.'
012601 And it came to pass, when Jesus finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
012602 'Ye have known that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of Man is delivered up to be crucified.'
012603 Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, to the court of the chief priest who was called Caiaphas;
012604 and they consulted together that they might take Jesus by guile, and kill [him],
012605 and they said, 'Not in the feast, that there may not be a tumult among the people.'
012606 And Jesus having been in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
012607 there came to him a woman having an alabaster box of ointment, very precious, and she poured on his head as he is reclining (at meat).
012608 And having seen [it], his disciples were much displeased, saying, 'To what purpose [is] this waste?
012609 for this ointment could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.'
012610 And Jesus having known, said to them, 'Why do ye give trouble to the woman? for a good work she wrought for me;
012611 for the poor always ye have with you, and me ye have not always;
012612 for she having put this ointment on my body -- for my burial she did [it].
012613 Verily I say to you, Wherever this good news may be proclaimed in the whole world, what this [one] did shall also be spoken of -- for a memorial of her.'
012614 Then one of the twelve, who is called Judas Iscariot, having gone unto the chief priests, said,
012615 'What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him up to you?' and they weighed out to him thirty silverlings,
012616 and from that time he was seeking a convenient season to deliver him up.
012617 And on the first [day] of the unleavened food came the disciples near to Jesus, saying to him, 'Where wilt thou [that] we may prepare for thee to eat the passover?'
012618 and he said, 'Go away to the city, unto such a one, and say to him, The Teacher saith, My time is nigh; near thee I keep the passover, with my disciples;'
012619 and the disciples did as Jesus appointed them, and prepared the passover.
012620 And evening having come, he was reclining (at meat) with the twelve,
012621 and while they are eating, he said, 'Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.'
012622 And being grieved exceedingly, they began to say to him, each of them, 'Is it I, Sir?'
012623 And he answering said, 'He who did dip with me the hand in the dish, he will deliver me up;
012624 the Son of Man doth indeed go, as it hath been written concerning him, but wo to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up! good it were for him if that man had not been born.'
012625 And Judas -- he who delivered him up -- answering said, 'Is it I, Rabbi?' He saith to him, 'Thou hast said.'
012626 And while they were eating, Jesus having taken the bread, and having blessed, did brake, and was giving to the disciples, and said, 'Take, eat, this is my body;'
012627 and having taken the cup, and having given thanks, he gave to them, saying, 'Drink ye of it -- all;
012628 for this is my blood of the new covenant, that for many is being poured out -- to remission of sins;
012629 and I say to you, that I may not drink henceforth on this produce of the vine, till that day when I may drink it with you new in the reign of my Father.'
012630 And having sung a hymn, they went forth to the mount of the Olives;
012631 then saith Jesus to them, 'All ye shall be stumbled at me this night; for it hath been written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad;
012632 but, after my having risen, I will go before you to Galilee.'
012633 And Peter answering said to him, 'Even if all shall be stumbled at thee, I will never be stumbled.'
012634 Jesus said to him, 'Verily I say to thee, that, this night, before cock-crowing, thrice thou wilt deny me.'
012635 Peter saith to him, 'Even if it may be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee;' in like manner also said all the disciples.
012636 Then come with them doth Jesus to a place called Gethsemane, and he saith to the disciples, 'Sit ye here, till having gone away, I shall pray yonder.'
012637 And having taken Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful, and to be very heavy;
012638 then saith he to them, 'Exceedingly sorrowful is my soul -- unto death; abide ye here, and watch with me.'
012639 And having gone forward a little, he fell on his face, praying, and saying, 'My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou.'
012640 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and he saith to Peter, 'So! ye were not able one hour to watch with me!
012641 watch, and pray, that ye may not enter into temptation: the spirit indeed is forward, but the flesh weak.'
012642 Again, a second time, having gone away, he prayed, saying, 'My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from me except I drink it, Thy will be done;'
012643 and having come, he findeth them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
012644 And having left them, having gone away again, he prayed a third time, saying the same word;
012645 then cometh he unto his disciples, and saith to them, 'Sleep on henceforth, and rest! lo, the hour hath come nigh, and the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of sinners.
012646 Rise, let us go; lo, he hath come nigh who is delivering me up.'
012647 And while he is yet speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve did come, and with him a great multitude, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
012648 And he who did deliver him up did give them a sign, saying, 'Whomsoever I will kiss, it is he: lay hold on him;'
012649 and immediately, having come to Jesus, he said, 'Hail, Rabbi,' and kissed him;
012650 and Jesus said to him, 'Comrade, for what art thou present?' Then having come near, they laid hands on Jesus, and took hold on him.
012651 And lo, one of those with Jesus, having stretched forth the hand, drew his sword, and having struck the servant of the chief priest, he took off his ear.
012652 Then saith Jesus to him, 'Turn back thy sword to its place; for all who did take the sword, by the sword shall perish;
012653 dost thou think that I am not able now to call upon my Father, and He will place beside me more than twelve legions of messengers?
012654 how then may the Writings be fulfilled, that thus it behoveth to happen?'
012655 In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, 'As against a robber ye did come forth, with swords and sticks, to take me! daily with you I was sitting teaching in the temple, and ye did not lay hold on me;
012656 but all this hath come to pass, that the Writings of the prophets may be fulfilled;' then all the disciples, having left him, fled.
012657 And those laying hold on Jesus led [him] away unto Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together,
012658 and Peter was following him afar off, unto the court of the chief priest, and having gone in within, he was sitting with the officers, to see the end.
012659 And the chief priests, and the elders, and all the council, were seeking false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death,
012660 and they did not find; and many false witnesses having come near, they did not find; and at last two false witnesses having come near,
012661 said, 'This one said, I am able to throw down the sanctuary of God, and after three days to build it.'
012662 And the chief priest having stood up, said to him, 'Nothing thou dost answer! what do these witness against thee?
012663 and Jesus was silent. And the chief priest answering said to him, 'I adjure thee, by the living God, that thou mayest say to us, if thou art the Christ -- the Son of God.'
012664 Jesus saith to him, 'Thou hast said; nevertheless I say to you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming upon the clouds, of the heaven.'
012665 Then the chief priest rent his garments, saying, -- 'He hath spoken evil; what need have we yet of witnesses? lo, now ye heard his evil speaking;
012666 what think ye?' and they answering said, 'He is worthy of death.'
012667 Then did they spit in his face and buffet him, and others did slap,
012668 saying, 'Declare to us, O Christ, who he is that struck thee?'
012669 And Peter without was sitting in the court, and there came near to him a certain maid, saying, 'And thou wast with Jesus of Galilee!'
012670 And he denied before all, saying, 'I have not known what thou sayest.'
012671 And he having gone forth to the porch, another female saw him, and saith to those there, 'And this one was with Jesus of Nazareth;'
012672 and again did he deny with an oath -- 'I have not known the man.'
012673 And after a little those standing near having come, said to Peter, 'Truly thou also art of them, for even thy speech doth make thee manifest.'
012674 Then began he to anathematise, and to swear -- 'I have not known the man;' and immediately did a cock crow,
012675 and Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, he having said to him -- 'Before cock-crowing, thrice thou wilt deny me;' and having gone without, he did weep bitterly.
012701 And morning having come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so as to put him to death;
012702 and having bound him, they did lead away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
012703 Then Judas -- he who delivered him up -- having seen that he was condemned, having repented, brought back the thirty silverlings to the chief priests, and to the elders, saying,
012704 'I did sin, having delivered up innocent blood;' and they said, 'What -- to us? thou shalt see!'
012705 and having cast down the silverlings in the sanctuary, he departed, and having gone away, he did strangle himself.
012706 And the chief priests having taken the silverlings, said, 'It is not lawful to put them to the treasury, seeing it is the price of blood;'
012707 and having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter, for the burial of strangers;
012708 therefore was that field called, 'Field of blood,' unto this day.
012709 Then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 'And I took the thirty silverlings, the price of him who hath been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel did price,
012710 and gave them for the field of the potter, as the Lord did appoint to me.'
012711 And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor did question him, saying, 'Art thou the king of the Jews!' And Jesus said to him, 'Thou sayest.'
012712 And in his being accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not answer any thing,
012713 then saith Pilate to him, 'Dost thou not hear how many things they witness against thee?'
012714 And he did not answer him, not even to one word, so that the governor did wonder greatly.
012715 And at the feast the governor had been accustomed to release one to the multitude, a prisoner, whom they willed,
012716 and they had then a noted prisoner, called Barabbas,
012717 they therefore having been gathered together, Pilate said to them, 'Whom will ye I shall release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?'
012718 for he had known that because of envy they had delivered him up.
012719 And as he is sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent unto him, saying, 'Nothing -- to thee and to that righteous one, for many things did I suffer to-day in a dream because of him.'
012720 And the chief priests and the elders did persuade the multitudes that they might ask for themselves Barabbas, and might destroy Jesus;
012721 and the governor answering said to them, 'Which of the two will ye [that] I shall release to you?' And they said, 'Barabbas.'
012722 Pilate saith to them, 'What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?' They all say to him, 'Let be crucified!'
012723 And the governor said, 'Why, what evil did he?' and they were crying out the more, saying, 'Let be crucified.'
012724 And Pilate having seen that it profiteth nothing, but rather a tumult is made, having taken water, he did wash the hands before the multitude, saying, 'I am innocent from the blood of this righteous one; ye -- ye shall see;'
012725 and all the people answering said, 'His blood [is] upon us, and upon our children!'
012726 Then did he release to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered [him] up that he may be crucified;
012727 then the soldiers of the governor having taken Jesus to the Praetorium, did gather to him all the band;
012728 and having unclothed him, they put around him a crimson cloak,
012729 and having plaited him a crown out of thorns they put [it] on his head, and a reed in his right hand, and having kneeled before him, they were mocking him, saying, 'Hail, the king of the Jews.'
012730 And having spit on him, they took the reed, and were smiting on his head;
012731 and when they had mocked him, they took off from him the cloak, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify [him].
012732 And coming forth, they found a man, a Cyrenian, by name Simon: him they impressed that he might bear his cross;
012733 and having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called Place of a Skull,
012734 they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall, and having tasted, he would not drink.
012735 And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting a lot, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the prophet, 'They divided my garments to themselves, and over my vesture they cast a lot;'
012736 and sitting down, they were watching him there,
012737 and they put up over his head, his accusation written, 'This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.'
012738 Then crucified with him are two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on the left,
012739 and those passing by were speaking evil of him, wagging their heads,
012740 and saying, 'Thou that art throwing down the sanctuary, and in three days building [it], save thyself; if Son thou art of God, come down from the cross.'
012741 And in like manner also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,
012742 'Others he saved; himself he is not able to save! If he be King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe him;
012743 he hath trusted on God, let Him now deliver him, if He wish him, because he said -- Son of God I am;'
012744 with the same also the robbers, who were crucified with him, were reproaching him.
012745 And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land unto the ninth hour,
012746 and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a great voice, saying, 'Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?' that is, 'My God, my God, why didst Thou forsake me?'
012747 And certain of those standing there having heard, said -- 'Elijah he doth call;'
012748 and immediately, one of them having run, and having taken a spunge, having filled [it] with vinegar, and having put [it] on a reed, was giving him to drink,
012749 but the rest said, 'Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth come -- about to save him.'
012750 And Jesus having again cried with a great voice, yielded the spirit;
012751 and lo, the vail of the sanctuary was rent in two from top unto bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent,
012752 and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who have fallen asleep, arose,
012753 and having come forth out of the tombs after his rising, they went into the holy city, and appeared to many.
012754 And the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were exceedingly afraid, saying, 'Truly this was God's Son.'
012755 And there were there many women beholding from afar, who did follow Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,
012756 among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and of Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
012757 And evening having come, there came a rich man, from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled to Jesus,
012758 he having gone near to Pilate, asked for himself the body of Jesus; then Pilate commanded the body to be given back.
012759 And having taken the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen,
012760 and laid it in his new tomb, that he hewed in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he went away;
012761 and there were there Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over-against the sepulchre.
012762 And on the morrow that is after the preparation, were gathered together the chief priests, and the Pharisees, unto Pilate,
012763 saying, 'Sir, we have remembered that that deceiver said while yet living, After three days I do rise;
012764 command, then, the sepulchre to be made secure till the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, may steal him away, and may say to the people, He rose from the dead, and the last deceit shall be worse than the first.'
012765 And Pilate said to them, 'Ye have a watch, go away, make secure -- as ye have known;'
012766 and they, having gone, did make the sepulchre secure, having sealed the stone, together with the watch.
012801 And on the eve of the sabbaths, at the dawn, toward the first of the sabbaths, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre,
012802 and lo, there came a great earthquake, for a messenger of the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come, did roll away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it,
012803 and his countenance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow,
012804 and from the fear of him did the keepers shake, and they became as dead men.
012805 And the messenger answering said to the women, 'Fear not ye, for I have known that Jesus, who hath been crucified, ye seek;
012806 he is not here, for he rose, as he said; come, see the place where the Lord was lying;
012807 and having gone quickly, say ye to his disciples, that he rose from the dead; and lo, he doth go before you to Galilee, there ye shall see him; lo, I have told you.'
012808 And having gone forth quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to tell to his disciples;
012809 and as they were going to tell to his disciples, then lo, Jesus met them, saying, 'Hail!' and they having come near, laid hold of his feet, and did bow to him.
012810 Then saith Jesus to them, 'Fear ye not, go away, tell to my brethren that they may go away to Galilee, and there they shall see me.'
012811 And while they are going on, lo, certain of the watch having come to the city, told to the chief priests all the things that happened,
012812 and having been gathered together with the elders, counsel also having taken, they gave much money to the soldiers,
012813 saying, 'Say ye, that his disciples having come by night, stole him -- we being asleep;
012814 and if this be heard by the governor, we will persuade him, and you keep free from anxiety.'
012815 And they, having received the money, did as they were taught, and this account was spread abroad among Jews till this day.
012816 And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mount where Jesus appointed them,
012817 and having seen him, they bowed to him, but some did waver.
012818 And having come near, Jesus spake to them, saying, 'Given to me was all authority in heaven and on earth;
012819 having gone, then, disciple all the nations, (baptizing them -- to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
012820 teaching them to observe all, whatever I did command you,) and lo, I am with you all the days -- till the full end of the age.'
020101 A beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, Son of God.
020102 As it hath been written in the prophets, 'Lo, I send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee,' --
020103 'A voice of one calling in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight make ye his paths,' --
020104 John came baptizing in the wilderness, and proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins,
020105 and there were going forth to him all the region of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and they were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
020106 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a girdle of skin around his loins, and eating locusts and honey of the field,
020107 and he proclaimed, saying, 'He doth come -- who is mightier than I -- after me, of whom I am not worthy -- having stooped down -- to loose the latchet of his sandals;
020108 I indeed did baptize you with water, but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.'
020109 And it came to pass in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John at the Jordan;
020110 and immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens dividing, and the Spirit as a dove coming down upon him;
020111 and a voice came out of the heavens, 'Thou art My Son -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'
020112 And immediately doth the Spirit put him forth to the wilderness,
020113 and he was there in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by the Adversary, and he was with the beasts, and the messengers were ministering to him.
020114 And after the delivering up of John, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of the reign of God,
020115 and saying -- 'Fulfilled hath been the time, and the reign of God hath come nigh, reform ye, and believe in the good news.'
020116 And, walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea, for they were fishers,
020117 and Jesus said to them, 'Come ye after me, and I shall make you to become fishers of men;'
020118 and immediately, having left their nets, they followed him.
020119 And having gone on thence a little, he saw James of Zebedee, and John his brother, and they were in the boat refitting the nets,
020120 and immediately he called them, and, having left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went away after him.
020121 And they go on to Capernaum, and immediately, on the sabbaths, having gone into the synagogue, he was teaching,
020122 and they were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
020123 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
020124 saying, 'Away! what -- to us and to thee, Jesus the Nazarene? thou didst come to destroy us; I have known thee who thou art -- the Holy One of God.'
020125 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, 'Be silenced, and come forth out of him,'
020126 and the unclean spirit having torn him, and having cried with a great voice, came forth out of him,
020127 and they were all amazed, so as to reason among themselves, saying, 'What is this? what new teaching [is] this? that with authority also the unclean spirits he commandeth, and they obey him!'
020128 And the fame of him went forth immediately to all the region, round about, of Galilee.
020129 And immediately, having come forth out of the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John,
020130 and the mother-in-law of Simon was lying fevered, and immediately they tell him about her,
020131 and having come near, he raised her up, having laid hold of her hand, and the fever left her immediately, and she was ministering to them.
020132 And evening having come, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all who were ill, and who were demoniacs,
020133 and the whole city was gathered together near the door,
020134 and he healed many who were ill of manifold diseases, and many demons he cast forth, and was not suffering the demons to speak, because they knew him.
020135 And very early, it being yet night, having risen, he went forth, and went away to a desert place, and was there praying;
020136 and Simon and those with him went in quest of him,
020137 and having found him, they say to him, -- 'All do seek thee;'
020138 and he saith to them, 'We may go to the next towns, that there also I may preach, for for this I came forth.'
020139 And he was preaching in their synagogues, in all Galilee, and is casting out the demons,
020140 and there doth come to him a leper, calling on him, and kneeling to him, and saying to him -- 'If thou mayest will, thou art able to cleanse me.'
020141 And Jesus having been moved with compassion, having stretched forth the hand, touched him, and saith to him, 'I will; be thou cleansed;'
020142 and he having spoken, immediately the leprosy went away from him, and he was cleansed.
020143 And having sternly charged him, immediately he put him forth,
020144 and saith to him, 'See thou mayest say nothing to any one, but go away, thyself shew to the priest, and bring near for thy cleansing the things Moses directed, for a testimony to them.'
020145 And he, having gone forth, began to proclaim much, and to spread abroad the thing, so that no more he was able openly to enter into the city, but he was without in desert places, and they were coming unto him from every quarter.
020201 And again he entered into Capernaum, after [some] days, and it was heard that he is in the house,
020202 and immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door, and he was speaking to them the word.
020203 And they come unto him, bringing a paralytic, borne by four,
020204 and not being able to come near to him because of the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was, and, having broken [it] up, they let down the couch on which the paralytic was lying,
020205 and Jesus having seen their faith, saith to the paralytic, 'Child, thy sins have been forgiven thee.'
020206 And there were certain of the scribes there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts,
020207 'Why doth this one thus speak evil words? who is able to forgive sins except one -- God?'
020208 And immediately Jesus, having known in his spirit that they thus reason in themselves, said to them, 'Why these things reason ye in your hearts?
020209 which is easier, to say to the paralytic, The sins have been forgiven to thee? or to say, Rise, and take up thy couch, and walk?
020210 'And, that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority on the earth to forgive sins -- (he saith to the paralytic) --
020211 I say to thee, Rise, and take up thy couch, and go away to thy house;'
020212 and he rose immediately, and having taken up the couch, he went forth before all, so that all were astonished, and do glorify God, saying -- 'Never thus did we see.'
020213 And he went forth again by the sea, and all the multitude was coming unto him, and he was teaching them,
020214 and passing by, he saw Levi of Alpheus sitting at the tax-office, and saith to him, 'Be following me,' and he, having risen, did follow him.
020215 And it came to pass, in his reclining (at meat) in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners were reclining (at meat) with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.
020216 And the scribes and the Pharisees, having seen him eating with the tax-gatherers and sinners, said to his disciples, 'Why -- that with the tax-gatherers and sinners he doth eat and drink?'
020217 And Jesus, having heard, saith to them, 'They who are strong have no need of a physician, but they who are ill; I came not to call righteous men, but sinners to reformation.'
020218 And the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were fasting, and they come and say to him, 'Wherefore do the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast, and thy disciples do not fast?'
020219 And Jesus said to them, 'Are the sons of the bride-chamber able, while the bridegroom is with them, to fast? so long time as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast;
020220 but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them, and then they shall fast -- in those days.
020221 'And no one a patch of undressed cloth doth sew on an old garment, and if not -- the new filling it up doth take from the old and the rent doth become worse;
020222 and no one doth put new wine into old skins, and if not -- the new wine doth burst the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine into new skins is to be put.'
020223 And it came to pass -- he is going along on the sabbaths through the corn-fields -- and his disciples began to make a way, plucking the ears,
020224 and the Pharisees said to him, 'Lo, why do they on the sabbaths that which is not lawful?'
020225 And he said to them, 'Did ye never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry, he and those with him?
020226 how he went into the house of God, (at 'Abiathar the chief priest,') and the loaves of the presentation did eat, which it is not lawful to eat, except to the priests, and he gave also to those who were with him?'
020227 And he said to them, 'The sabbath for man was made, not man for the sabbath,
020228 so that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath.'
020301 And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was there a man having the hand withered,
020302 and they were watching him, whether on the sabbaths he will heal him, that they might accuse him.
020303 And he saith to the man having the hand withered, 'Rise up in the midst.'
020304 And he saith to them, 'Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good, or to do evil? life to save, or to kill?' but they were silent.
020305 And having looked round upon them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their heart, he saith to the man, 'Stretch forth thy hand;' and he stretched forth, and his hand was restored whole as the other;
020306 and the Pharisees having gone forth, immediately, with the Herodians, were taking counsel against him how they might destroy him.
020307 And Jesus withdrew with his disciples unto the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,
020308 and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon -- a great multitude -- having heard how great things he was doing, came unto him.
020309 And he said to his disciples that a little boat may wait on him, because of the multitude, that they may not press upon him,
020310 for he did heal many, so that they threw themselves on him, in order to touch him -- as many as had plagues;
020311 and the unclean spirits, when they were seeing him, were falling down before him, and were crying, saying -- 'Thou art the Son of God;'
020312 and many times he was charging them that they might not make him manifest.
020313 And he goeth up to the mountain, and doth call near whom he willed, and they went away to him;
020314 and he appointed twelve, that they may be with him, and that he may send them forth to preach,
020315 and to have power to heal the sicknesses, and to cast out the demons.
020316 And he put on Simon the name Peter;
020317 and James of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he put on them names -- Boanerges, that is, 'Sons of thunder;'
020318 and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananite,
020319 and Judas Iscariot, who did also deliver him up; and they come into a house.
020320 And come together again doth a multitude, so that they are not able even to eat bread;
020321 and his friends having heard, went forth to lay hold on him, for they said that he was beside himself,
020322 and the scribes who [are] from Jerusalem having come down, said -- 'He hath Beelzeboul,' and -- 'By the ruler of the demons he doth cast out the demons.'
020323 And, having called them near, in similes he said to them, 'How is the Adversary able to cast out the Adversary?
020324 and if a kingdom against itself be divided, that kingdom cannot be made to stand;
020325 and if a house against itself be divided, that house cannot be made to stand;
020326 and if the Adversary did rise against himself, and hath been divided, he cannot be made to stand, but hath an end.
020327 'No one is able the vessels of the strong man -- having entered into his house -- to spoil, if first he may not bind the strong man, and then his house he will spoil.
020328 'Verily I say to you, that all the sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and evil speakings with which they might speak evil,
020329 but whoever may speak evil in regard to the Holy Spirit hath not forgiveness -- to the age, but is in danger of age-during judgment;'
020330 because they said, 'He hath an unclean spirit.'
020331 Then come do his brethren and mother, and standing without, they sent unto him, calling him,
020332 and a multitude was sitting about him, and they said to him, 'Lo, thy mother and thy brethren without do seek thee.'
020333 And he answered them, saying, 'Who is my mother, or my brethren?'
020334 And having looked round in a circle to those sitting about him, he saith, 'Lo, my mother and my brethren!
020335 for whoever may do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.'
020401 And again he began to teach by the sea, and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he, having gone into the boat, sat in the sea, and all the multitude was near the sea, on the land,
020402 and he taught them many things in similes, and he said to them in his teaching:
020403 'Hearken, lo, the sower went forth to sow;
020404 and it came to pass, in the sowing, some fell by the way, and the fowls of the heaven did come and devour it;
020405 and other fell upon the rocky ground, where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprang forth, because of not having depth of earth,
020406 and the sun having risen, it was scorched, and because of not having root it did wither;
020407 and other fell toward the thorns, and the thorns did come up, and choke it, and fruit it gave not;
020408 and other fell to the good ground, and was giving fruit, coming up and increasing, and it bare, one thirty-fold, and one sixty, and one an hundred.'
020409 And he said to them, 'He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.'
020410 And when he was alone, those about him, with the twelve, did ask him of the simile,
020411 and he said to them, 'To you it hath been given to know the secret of the reign of God, but to those who are without, in similes are all the things done;
020412 that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest they may turn, and the sins may be forgiven them.'
020413 And he saith to them, 'Have ye not known this simile? and how shall ye know all the similes?
020414 He who is sowing doth sow the word;
020415 and these are they by the way where the word is sown: and whenever they may hear, immediately cometh the Adversary, and he taketh away the word that hath been sown in their hearts.
020416 'And these are they, in like manner, who on the rocky ground are sown: who, whenever they may hear the word, immediately with joy do receive it,
020417 and have not root in themselves, but are temporary; afterward tribulation or persecution having come because of the word, immediately they are stumbled.
020418 'And these are they who toward the thorns are sown: these are they who are hearing the word,
020419 and the anxieties of this age, and the deceitfulness of the riches, and the desires concerning the other things, entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
020420 'And these are they who on the good ground have been sown: who do hear the word, and receive, and do bear fruit, one thirty-fold, and one sixty, and one an hundred.'
020421 And he said to them, 'Doth the lamp come that under the measure it may be put, or under the couch -- not that it may be put on the lamp-stand?
020422 for there is not anything hid that may not be manifested, nor was anything kept hid but that it may come to light.
020423 If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear.'
020424 And he said to them, 'Take heed what ye hear; in what measure ye measure, it shall be measured to you; and to you who hear it shall be added;
020425 for whoever may have, there shall be given to him, and whoever hath not, also that which he hath shall be taken from him.'
020426 And he said, 'Thus is the reign of God: as if a man may cast the seed on the earth,
020427 and may sleep, and may rise night and day, and the seed spring up and grow, he hath not known how;
020428 for of itself doth the earth bear fruit, first a blade, afterwards an ear, afterwards full corn in the ear;
020429 and whenever the fruit may yield itself, immediately he doth send forth the sickle, because the harvest hath come.'
020430 And he said, 'To what may we liken the reign of God, or in what simile may we compare it?
020431 As a grain of mustard, which, whenever it may be sown on the earth, is less than any of the seeds that are on the earth;
020432 and whenever it may be sown, it cometh up, and doth become greater than any of the herbs, and doth make great branches, so that under its shade the fowls of the heaven are able to rest.'
020433 And with many such similes he was speaking to them the word, as they were able to hear,
020434 and without a simile he was not speaking to them, and by themselves, to his disciples he was expounding all.
020435 And he saith to them on that day, evening having come, 'We may pass over to the other side;'
020436 and having let away the multitude, they take him up as he was in the boat, and other little boats also were with him.
020437 And there cometh a great storm of wind, and the waves were beating on the boat, so that it is now being filled,
020438 and he himself was upon the stern, upon the pillow sleeping, and they wake him up, and say to him, 'Teacher, art thou not caring that we perish?'
020439 And having waked up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, 'Peace, be stilled;' and the wind did lull, and there was a great calm:
020440 and he said to them, 'Why are ye so fearful? how have ye not faith?'
020441 and they feared a great fear, and said one to another, 'Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the sea do obey him?'
020501 And they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gadarenes,
020502 and he having come forth out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
020503 who had his dwelling in the tombs, and not even with chains was any one able to bind him,
020504 because that he many times with fetters and chains had been bound, and pulled in pieces by him had been the chains, and the fetters broken in pieces, and none was able to tame him,
020505 and always, night and day, in the mountains, and in the tombs he was, crying and cutting himself with stones.
020506 And, having seen Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed before him,
020507 and having called with a loud voice, he said, 'What -- to me and to thee, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I adjure thee by God, mayest thou not afflict me!'
020508 (for he said to him, 'Come forth, spirit unclean, out of the man,')
020509 and he was questioning him, 'What [is] thy name?' and he answered, saying, 'Legion [is] my name, because we are many;'
020510 and he was calling on him much, that he may not send them out of the region.
020511 And there was there, near the mountains, a great herd of swine feeding,
020512 and all the demons did call upon him, saying, 'Send us to the swine, that into them we may enter;'
020513 and immediately Jesus gave them leave, and having come forth, the unclean spirits did enter into the swine, and the herd did rush down the steep place to the sea -- and they were about two thousand -- and they were choked in the sea.
020514 And those feeding the swine did flee, and told in the city, and in the fields, and they came forth to see what it is that hath been done;
020515 and they come unto Jesus, and see the demoniac, sitting, and clothed, and right-minded -- him having had the legion -- and they were afraid;
020516 and those having seen [it], declared to them how it had come to pass to the demoniac, and about the swine;
020517 and they began to call upon him to go away from their borders.
020518 And he having gone into the boat, the demoniac was calling on him that he may be with him,
020519 and Jesus did not suffer him, but saith to him, 'Go away to thy house, unto thine own [friends], and tell them how great things the Lord did to thee, and dealt kindly with thee;
020520 and he went away, and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus did to him, and all were wondering.
020521 And Jesus having passed over in the boat again to the other side, there was gathered a great multitude to him, and he was near the sea,
020522 and lo, there doth come one of the chiefs of the synagogue, by name Jairus, and having seen him, he doth fall at his feet,
020523 and he was calling upon him much, saying -- 'My little daughter is at the last extremity -- that having come, thou mayest lay on her [thy] hands, so that she may be saved, and she shall live;'
020524 and he went away with him. And there was following him a great multitude, and they were thronging him,
020525 and a certain woman, having an issue of blood twelve years,
020526 and many things having suffered under many physicians, and having spent all that she had, and having profited nothing, but rather having come to the worse,
020527 having heard about Jesus, having come in the multitude behind, she touched his garment,
020528 for she said -- 'If even his garments I may touch, I shall be saved;'
020529 and immediately was the fountain of her blood dried up, and she knew in the body that she hath been healed of the plague.
020530 And immediately Jesus having known in himself that out of him power had gone forth, having turned about in the multitude, said, 'Who did touch my garments?'
020531 and his disciples said to him, 'Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and thou sayest, 'Who did touch me!'
020532 And he was looking round to see her who did this,
020533 and the woman, having been afraid, and trembling, knowing what was done on her, came, and fell down before him, and told him all the truth,
020534 and he said to her, 'Daughter, thy faith hath saved thee; go away in peace, and be whole from thy plague.'
020535 As he is yet speaking, there come from the chief of the synagogue's [house, certain], saying -- 'Thy daughter did die, why still dost thou harass the Teacher?'
020536 And Jesus immediately, having heard the word that is spoken, saith to the chief of the synagogue, 'Be not afraid, only believe.'
020537 And he did not suffer any one to follow with him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James;
020538 and he cometh to the house of the chief of the synagogue, and seeth a tumult, much weeping and wailing;
020539 and having gone in he saith to them, 'Why do ye make a tumult, and weep? the child did not die, but doth sleep;
020540 and they were laughing at him. And he, having put all forth, doth take the father of the child, and the mother, and those with him, and goeth in where the child is lying,
020541 and, having taken the hand of the child, he saith to her, 'Talitha cumi;' which is, being interpreted, 'Damsel (I say to thee), arise.'
020542 And immediately the damsel arose, and was walking, for she was twelve years [old]; and they were amazed with a great amazement,
020543 and he charged them much, that no one may know this thing, and he said that there be given to her to eat.
020601 And he went forth thence, and came to his own country, and his disciples do follow him,
020602 and sabbath having come, he began in the synagogue to teach, and many hearing were astonished, saying, 'Whence hath this one these things? and what the wisdom that was given to him, that also such mighty works through his hands are done?
020603 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?' -- and they were being stumbled at him.
020604 And Jesus said to them -- 'A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his kindred, and in his own house;'
020605 and he was not able there any mighty work to do, except on a few infirm people having put hands he did heal [them];
020606 and he wondered because of their unbelief. And he was going round the villages, in a circle, teaching,
020607 and he doth call near the twelve, and he began to send them forth two by two, and he was giving them power over the unclean spirits,
020608 and he commanded them that they may take nothing for the way, except a staff only -- no scrip, no bread, no brass in the girdle,
020609 but having been shod with sandals, and ye may not put on two coats.
020610 And he said to them, 'Whenever ye may enter into a house, there remain till ye may depart thence,
020611 and as many as may not receive you, nor hear you, going out thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony to them; verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in a day of judgment than for that city.'
020612 And having gone forth they were preaching that [men] might reform,
020613 and many demons they were casting out, and they were anointing with oil many infirm, and they were healing [them].
020614 And the king Herod heard, (for his name became public,) and he said -- 'John the Baptist out of the dead was raised, and because of this the mighty powers are working in him.'
020615 Others said -- 'It is Elijah,' and others said -- 'It is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.'
020616 And Herod having heard, said -- 'He whom I did behead -- John -- this is he; he was raised out of the dead.'
020617 For Herod himself, having sent forth, did lay hold on John, and bound him in the prison, because of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he married her,
020618 for John said to Herod -- 'It is not lawful to thee to have the wife of thy brother;'
020619 and Herodias was having a quarrel with him, and was willing to kill him, and was not able,
020620 for Herod was fearing John, knowing him a man righteous and holy, and was keeping watch over him, and having heard him, was doing many things, and hearing him gladly.
020621 And a seasonable day having come, when Herod on his birthday was making a supper to his great men, and to the chiefs of thousands, and to the first men of Galilee,
020622 and the daughter of that Herodias having come in, and having danced, and having pleased Herod and those reclining (at meat) with him, the king said to the damsel, 'Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give to thee,'
020623 and he sware to her -- 'Whatever thou mayest ask me, I will give to thee -- unto the half of my kingdom.'
020624 And she, having gone forth, said to her mother, 'What shall I ask for myself?' and she said, 'The head of John the Baptist;'
020625 and having come in immediately with haste unto the king, she asked, saying, 'I will that thou mayest give me presently, upon a plate, the head of John the Baptist.'
020626 And the king -- made very sorrowful -- because of the oaths and of those reclining (at meat) with him, would not put her away,
020627 and immediately the king having sent a guardsman, did command his head to be brought,
020628 and he having gone, beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head upon a plate, and did give it to the damsel, and the damsel did give it to her mother;
020629 and having heard, his disciples came and took up his corpse, and laid it in the tomb.
020630 And the apostles are gathered together unto Jesus, and they told him all, and how many things they did, and how many things they taught,
020631 and he said to them, 'Come ye yourselves apart to a desert place, and rest a little,' for those coming and those going were many, and not even to eat had they opportunity,
020632 and they went away to a desert place, in the boat, by themselves.
020633 And the multitudes saw them going away, and many recognised him, and by land from all the cities they ran thither, and went before them, and came together to him,
020634 and having come forth, Jesus saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion on them, that they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach many things.
020635 And now the hour being advanced, his disciples having come near to him, say, -- 'The place is desolate, and the hour is now advanced,
020636 let them away, that, having gone away to the surrounding fields and villages, they may buy to themselves loaves, for what they may eat they have not.'
020637 And he answering said to them, 'Give ye them to eat,' and they say to him, 'Having gone away, may we buy two hundred denaries' worth of loaves, and give to them to eat?'
020638 And he saith to them, 'How many loaves have ye? go and see;' and having known, they say, 'Five, and two fishes.'
020639 And he commanded them to make all recline in companies upon the green grass,
020640 and they sat down in squares, by hundreds, and by fifties.
020641 And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, having looked up to the heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves, and was giving to his disciples, that they may set before them, and the two fishes divided he to all,
020642 and they did all eat, and were filled,
020643 and they took up of broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full, and of the fishes,
020644 and those eating of the loaves were about five thousand men.
020645 And immediately he constrained his disciples to go into the boat, and to go before to the other side, unto Bethsaida, till he may let the multitude away,
020646 and having taken leave of them, he went away to the mountain to pray.
020647 And evening having come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon the land;
020648 and he saw them harassed in the rowing, for the wind was against them, and about the fourth watch of the night he doth come to them walking on the sea, and wished to pass by them.
020649 And they having seen him walking on the sea, thought [it] to be an apparition, and cried out,
020650 for they all saw him, and were troubled, and immediately he spake with them, and saith to them, 'Take courage, I am [he], be not afraid.'
020651 And he went up unto them to the boat, and the wind lulled, and greatly out of measure were they amazed in themselves, and were wondering,
020652 for they understood not concerning the loaves, for their heart hath been hard.
020653 And having passed over, they came upon the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore,
020654 and they having come forth out of the boat, immediately having recognised him,
020655 having run about through all that region round about, they began upon the couches to carry about those ill, where they were hearing that he is,
020656 and wherever he was going, to villages, or cities, or fields, in the market-places they were laying the infirm, and were calling upon him, that they may touch if it were but the fringe of his garment, and as many as were touching him were saved.
020701 And gathered together unto him are the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem,
020702 and having seen certain of his disciples with defiled hands -- that is, unwashed -- eating bread, they found fault;
020703 for the Pharisees, and all the Jews, if they do not wash the hands to the wrist, do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders,
020704 and, [coming] from the market-place, if they do not baptize themselves, they do not eat; and many other things there are that they received to hold, baptisms of cups, and pots, and brazen vessels, and couches.
020705 Then question him do the Pharisees and the scribes, 'Wherefore do thy disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but with unwashed hands do eat the bread?'
020706 and he answering said to them -- 'Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, hypocrites, as it hath been written, This people with the lips doth honor Me, and their heart is far from Me;
020707 and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings, commands of men;
020708 for, having put away the command of God, ye hold the tradition of men, baptisms of pots and cups; and many other such like things ye do.'
020709 And he said to them, 'Well do ye put away the command of God that your tradition ye may keep;
020710 for Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death;
020711 and ye say, If a man may say to father or to mother, Korban (that is, a gift), [is] whatever thou mayest be profited out of mine,
020712 and no more do ye suffer him to do anything for his father or for his mother,
020713 setting aside the word of God for your tradition that ye delivered; and many such like things ye do.'
020714 And having called near all the multitude, he said to them, 'Hearken to me, ye all, and understand;
020715 there is nothing from without the man entering into him that is able to defile him, but the things coming out from him, those are the things defiling the man.
020716 If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear.'
020717 And when he entered into a house from the multitude, his disciples were questioning him about the simile,
020718 and he saith to them, 'So also ye are without understanding! Do ye not perceive that nothing from without entering into the man is able to defile him?
020719 because it doth not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and into the drain it doth go out, purifying all the meats.'
020720 And he said -- 'That which is coming out from the man, that doth defile the man;
020721 for from within, out of the heart of men, the evil reasonings do come forth, adulteries, whoredoms, murders,
020722 thefts, covetous desires, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, an evil eye, evil speaking, pride, foolishness;
020723 all these evils do come forth from within, and they defile the man.'
020724 And from thence having risen, he went away to the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and having entered into the house, he wished none to know, and he was not able to be hid,
020725 for a woman having heard about him, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet, --
020726 and the woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phenician by nation -- and was asking him, that the demon he may cast forth out of her daughter.
020727 And Jesus said to her, 'Suffer first the children to be filled, for it is not good to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] to the little dogs.'
020728 And she answered and saith to him, 'Yes, sir; for the little dogs also under the table do eat of the children's crumbs.'
020729 And he said to her, 'Because of this word go; the demon hath gone forth out of thy daughter;'
020730 and having come away to her house, she found the demon gone forth, and the daughter laid upon the couch.
020731 And again, having gone forth from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis,
020732 and they bring to him a deaf, stuttering man, and they call on him that he may put the hand on him.
020733 And having taken him away from the multitude by himself, he put his fingers to his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue,
020734 and having looked to the heaven, he sighed, and saith to him, 'Ephphatha,' that is, 'Be thou opened;'
020735 and immediately were his ears opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he was speaking plain.
020736 And he charged them that they may tell no one, but the more he was charging them, the more abundantly they were proclaiming [it],
020737 and they were being beyond measure astonished, saying, 'Well hath he done all things; both the deaf he doth make to hear, and the dumb to speak.'
020801 In those days the multitude being very great, and not having what they may eat, Jesus having called near his disciples, saith to them,
020802 'I have compassion upon the multitude, because now three days they do continue with me, and they have not what they may eat;
020803 and if I shall let them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way, for certain of them are come from far.'
020804 And his disciples answered him, 'Whence shall any one be able these here to feed with bread in a wilderness?'
020805 And he was questioning them, 'How many loaves have ye?' and they said, 'Seven.'
020806 And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground, and having taken the seven loaves, having given thanks, he brake, and was giving to his disciples that they may set before [them]; and they did set before the multitude.
020807 And they had a few small fishes, and having blessed, he said to set them also before [them];
020808 and they did eat and were filled, and they took up that which was over of broken pieces -- seven baskets;
020809 and those eating were about four thousand. And he let them away,
020810 and immediately having entered into the boat with his disciples, he came to the parts of Dalmanutha,
020811 and the Pharisees came forth, and began to dispute with him, seeking from him a sign from the heaven, tempting him;
020812 and having sighed deeply in his spirit, he saith, 'Why doth this generation seek after a sign? Verily I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.'
020813 And having left them, having entered again into the boat, he went away to the other side;
020814 and they forgot to take loaves, and except one loaf they had nothing with them in the boat,
020815 and he was charging them, saying, 'Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod,'
020816 and they were reasoning with one another, saying -- 'Because we have no loaves.'
020817 And Jesus having known, saith to them, 'Why do ye reason, because ye have no loaves? do ye not yet perceive, nor understand, yet have ye your heart hardened?
020818 Having eyes, do ye not see? and having ears, do ye not hear? and do ye not remember?
020819 When the five loaves I did brake to the five thousand, how many hand-baskets full of broken pieces took ye up?' they say to him, 'Twelve.'
020820 'And when the seven to the four thousand, how many hand-baskets full of broken pieces took ye up?' and they said, 'Seven.'
020821 And he said to them, 'How do ye not understand?'
020822 And he cometh to Bethsaida, and they bring to him one blind, and call upon him that he may touch him,
020823 and having taken the hand of the blind man, he led him forth without the village, and having spit on his eyes, having put [his] hands on him, he was questioning him if he doth behold anything:
020824 and he, having looked up, said, 'I behold men, as I see trees, walking.'
020825 Afterwards again he put [his] hands on his eyes, and made him look up, and he was restored, and discerned all things clearly,
020826 and he sent him away to his house, saying, 'Neither to the village mayest thou go, nor tell [it] to any in the village.'
020827 And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, to the villages of Cesarea Philippi, and in the way he was questioning his disciples, saying to them, 'Who do men say me to be?'
020828 And they answered, 'John the Baptist, and others Elijah, but others one of the prophets.'
020829 And he saith to them, 'And ye -- who do ye say me to be?' and Peter answering saith to him, 'Thou art the Christ.'
020830 And he strictly charged them that they may tell no one about it,
020831 and began to teach them, that it behoveth the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again;
020832 and openly he was speaking the word. And Peter having taken him aside, began to rebuke him,
020833 and he, having turned, and having looked on his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, 'Get behind me, Adversary, because thou dost not mind the things of God, but the things of men.'
020834 And having called near the multitude, with his disciples, he said to them, 'Whoever doth will to come after me -- let him disown himself, and take up his cross, and follow me;
020835 for whoever may will to save his life shall lose it; and whoever may lose his life for my sake and for the good news' sake, he shall save it;
020836 for what shall it profit a man, if he may gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?
020837 Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life?
020838 for whoever may be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also shall be ashamed of him, when he may come in the glory of his Father, with the holy messengers.'
020901 And he said to them, 'Verily I say to you, That there are certain of those standing here, who may not taste of death till they see the reign of God having come in power.'
020902 And after six days doth Jesus take Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up to a high mount by themselves, alone, and he was transfigured before them,
020903 and his garments became glittering, white exceedingly, as snow, so as a fuller upon the earth is not able to whiten [them].
020904 And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
020905 And Peter answering saith to Jesus, 'Rabbi, it is good to us to be here; and we may make three booths, for thee one, and for Moses one, and for Elijah one:'
020906 for he was not knowing what he might say, for they were greatly afraid.
020907 And there came a cloud overshadowing them, and there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, 'This is My Son -- the Beloved, hear ye him;'
020908 and suddenly, having looked around, they saw no one any more, but Jesus only with themselves.
020909 And as they are coming down from the mount, he charged them that they may declare to no one the things that they saw, except when the Son of Man may rise out of the dead;
020910 and the thing they kept to themselves, questioning together what the rising out of the dead is.
020911 And they were questioning him, saying, that the scribes say that Elijah it behoveth to come first.
020912 And he answering said to them, 'Elijah indeed, having come first, doth restore all things; and how hath it been written concerning the Son of Man, that many things he may suffer, and be set at nought?
020913 But I say to you, That also Elijah hath come, and they did to him what they willed, as it hath been written of him.'
020914 And having come unto the disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them,
020915 and immediately, all the multitude having seen him, were amazed, and running near, were saluting him.
020916 And he questioned the scribes, 'What dispute ye with them?'
020917 and one out of the multitude answering said, 'Teacher, I brought my son unto thee, having a dumb spirit;
020918 and wherever it doth seize him, it doth tear him, and he foameth, and gnasheth his teeth, and pineth away; and I spake to thy disciples that they may cast it out, and they were not able.'
020919 And he answering him, said, 'O generation unbelieving, till when shall I be with you? till when shall I suffer you? bring him unto me;'
020920 and they brought him unto him, and he having seen him, immediately the spirit tare him, and he, having fallen upon the earth, was wallowing -- foaming.
020921 And he questioned his father, 'How long time is it since this came to him?' and he said, 'From childhood,
020922 and many times also it cast him into fire, and into water, that it might destroy him; but if thou art able to do anything, help us, having compassion on us.'
020923 And Jesus said to him, 'If thou art able to believe! all things are possible to the one that is believing;'
020924 and immediately the father of the child, having cried out, with tears said, 'I believe, sir; be helping mine unbelief.'
020925 Jesus having seen that a multitude doth run together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, 'Spirit -- dumb and deaf -- I charge thee, come forth out of him, and no more thou mayest enter into him;'
020926 and having cried, and rent him much, it came forth, and he became as dead, so that many said that he was dead,
020927 but Jesus, having taken him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose.
020928 And he having come into the house, his disciples were questioning him by himself -- 'Why were we not able to cast it forth?'
020929 And he said to them, 'This kind is able to come forth with nothing except with prayer and fasting.'
020930 And having gone forth thence, they were passing through Galilee, and he did not wish that any may know,
020931 for he was teaching his disciples, and he said to them, 'The Son of Man is being delivered to the hands of men, and they shall kill him, and having been killed the third day he shall rise,'
020932 but they were not understanding the saying, and they were afraid to question him.
020933 And he came to Capernaum, and being in the house, he was questioning them, 'What were ye reasoning in the way among yourselves?'
020934 and they were silent, for with one another they did reason in the way who is greater;
020935 and having sat down he called the twelve, and he saith to them, 'If any doth will to be first, he shall be last of all, and minister of all.'
020936 And having taken a child, he set him in the midst of them, and having taken him in his arms, said to them,
020937 'Whoever may receive one of such children in my name, doth receive me, and whoever may receive me, doth not receive me, but Him who sent me.'
020938 And John did answer him, saying, 'Teacher, we saw a certain one in thy name casting out demons, who doth not follow us, and we forbade him, because he doth not follow us.'
020939 And Jesus said, 'Forbid him not, for there is no one who shall do a mighty work in my name, and shall be able readily to speak evil of me:
020940 for he who is not against us is for us;
020941 for whoever may give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because ye are Christ's, verily I say to you, he may not lose his reward;
020942 and whoever may cause to stumble one of the little ones believing in me, better is it for him if a millstone is hanged about his neck, and he hath been cast into the sea.
020943 'And if thy hand may cause thee to stumble, cut it off; it is better for thee maimed to enter into the life, than having the two hands, to go away to the gehenna, to the fire -- the unquenchable --
020944 where there worm is not dying, and the fire is not being quenched.
020945 'And if thy foot may cause thee to stumble, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into the life lame, than having the two feet to be cast to the gehenna, to the fire -- the unquenchable --
020946 where there worm is not dying, and the fire is not being quenched.
020947 And if thine eye may cause thee to stumble, cast it out; it is better for thee one-eyed to enter into the reign of God, than having two eyes, to be cast to the gehenna of the fire --
020948 where their worm is not dying, and the fire is not being quenched;
020949 for every one with fire shall be salted, and every sacrifice with salt shall be salted.
020950 The salt [is] good, but if the salt may become saltless, in what will ye season [it]? Have in yourselves salt, and have peace in one another.'
021001 And having risen thence, he doth come to the coasts of Judea, through the other side of the Jordan, and again do multitudes come together unto him, and, as he had been accustomed, again he was teaching them.
021002 And the Pharisees, having come near, questioned him, if it is lawful for a husband to put away a wife, tempting him,
021003 and he answering said to them, 'What did Moses command you?'
021004 and they said, 'Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce, and to put away.'
021005 And Jesus answering said to them, 'For the stiffness of your heart he wrote you this command,
021006 but from the beginning of the creation, a male and a female God did make them;
021007 on this account shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife,
021008 and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh; so that they are no more two, but one flesh;
021009 what therefore God did join together, let not man put asunder.'
021010 And in the house again his disciples of the same thing questioned him,
021011 and he saith to them, 'Whoever may put away his wife, and may marry another, doth commit adultery against her;
021012 and if a woman may put away her husband, and is married to another, she committeth adultery.'
021013 And they were bringing to him children, that he might touch them, and the disciples were rebuking those bringing them,
021014 and Jesus having seen, was much displeased, and he said to them, 'Suffer the children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the reign of God;
021015 verily I say to you, whoever may not receive the reign of God, as a child -- he may not enter into it;'
021016 and having taken them in his arms, having put [his] hands upon them, he was blessing them.
021017 And as he is going forth into the way, one having run and having kneeled to him, was questioning him, 'Good teacher, what may I do, that life age-during I may inherit?'
021018 And Jesus said to him, 'Why me dost thou call good? no one [is] good except One -- God;
021019 the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal, Thou mayest not bear false witness, Thou mayest not defraud, Honour thy father and mother.'
021020 And he answering said to him, 'Teacher, all these did I keep from my youth.'
021021 And Jesus having looked upon him, did love him, and said to him, 'One thing thou dost lack; go away, whatever thou hast -- sell, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, be following me, having taken up the cross.'
021022 And he -- gloomy at the word -- went away sorrowing, for he was having many possessions.
021023 And Jesus having looked round, saith to his disciples, 'How hardly shall they who have riches enter into the reign of God!'
021024 And the disciples were astonished at his words, and Jesus again answering saith to them, 'Children, how hard is it to those trusting on the riches to enter into the reign of God!
021025 It is easier for a camel through the eye of the needle to enter, than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God.'
021026 And they were astonished beyond measure, saying unto themselves, 'And who is able to be saved?'
021027 And Jesus, having looked upon them, saith, 'With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.'
021028 And Peter began to say to him, 'Lo, we left all, and we followed thee.'
021029 And Jesus answering said, 'Verily I say to you, there is no one who left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for my sake, and for the good news',
021030 who may not receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and fields, with persecutions, and in the age that is coming, life age-during;
021031 and many first shall be last, and the last first.'
021032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going before them, and they were amazed, and following they were afraid. And having again taken the twelve, he began to tell them the things about to happen to him,
021033 -- 'Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the nations,
021034 and they shall mock him, and scourge him, and spit on him, and kill him, and the third day he shall rise again.'
021035 And there come near to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying, 'Teacher, we wish that whatever we may ask for ourselves, thou mayest do for us;'
021036 and he said to them, 'What do ye wish me to do for you?'
021037 and they said to him, 'Grant to us that, one on thy right hand and one on thy left, we may sit in thy glory;'
021038 and Jesus said to them, 'Ye have not known what ye ask; are ye able to drink of the cup that I drink of, and with the baptism that I am baptized with -- to be baptized?'
021039 And they said to him, 'We are able;' and Jesus said to them, 'Of the cup indeed that I drink of, ye shall drink, and with the baptism that I am baptized with, ye shall be baptized;
021040 but to sit on my right and on my left, is not mine to give, but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared.'
021041 And the ten having heard, began to be much displeased at James and John,
021042 but Jesus having called them near, saith to them, 'Ye have known that they who are considered to rule the nations do exercise lordship over them, and their great ones do exercise authority upon them;
021043 but not so shall it be among you; but whoever may will to become great among you, he shall be your minister,
021044 and whoever of you may will to become first, he shall be servant of all;
021045 for even the Son of Man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.'
021046 And they come to Jericho, and as he is going forth from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, a son of Timaeus -- Bartimaeus the blind -- was sitting beside the way begging,
021047 and having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and to say, 'The Son of David -- Jesus! deal kindly with me;'
021048 and many were rebuking him, that he might keep silent, but the more abundantly he cried out, 'Son of David, deal kindly with me.'
021049 And Jesus having stood, he commanded him to be called, and they call the blind man, saying to him, 'Take courage, rise, he doth call thee;'
021050 and he, having cast away his garment, having risen, did come unto Jesus.
021051 And answering, Jesus saith to him, 'What wilt thou I may do to thee?' and the blind man said to him, 'Rabboni, that I may see again;'
021052 and Jesus said to him, 'Go, thy faith hath saved thee:' and immediately he saw again, and was following Jesus in the way.
021101 And when they come nigh to Jerusalem, to Bethphage, and Bethany, unto the mount of the Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
021102 and saith to them, 'Go away to the village that is over-against you, and immediately, entering into it, ye shall find a colt tied, on which no one of men hath sat, having loosed it, bring [it]:
021103 and if any one may say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that the lord hath need of it, and immediately he will send it hither.'
021104 And they went away, and found the colt tied at the door without, by the two ways, and they loose it,
021105 and certain of those standing there said to them, 'What do ye -- loosing the colt?'
021106 and they said to them as Jesus commanded, and they suffered them.
021107 And they brought the colt unto Jesus, and did cast upon it their garments, and he sat upon it,
021108 and many did spread their garments in the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and were strewing in the way.
021109 And those going before and those following were crying out, saying, 'Hosanna! blessed [is] he who is coming in the name of the Lord;
021110 blessed is the coming reign, in the name of the Lord, of our father David; Hosanna in the highest.'
021111 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple, and having looked round on all things, it being now evening, he went forth to Bethany with the twelve.
021112 And on the morrow, they having come forth from Bethany, he hungered,
021113 and having seen a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he came, if perhaps he shall find anything in it, and having come to it, he found nothing except leaves, for it was not a time of figs,
021114 and Jesus answering said to it, 'No more from thee -- to the age -- may any eat fruit;' and his disciples were hearing.
021115 And they come to Jerusalem, and Jesus having gone into the temple, began to cast forth those selling and buying in the temple, and the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those selling the doves, he overthrew,
021116 and he did not suffer that any might bear a vessel through the temple,
021117 and he was teaching, saying to them, 'Hath it not been written -- My house a house of prayer shall be called for all the nations, and ye did make it a den of robbers?'
021118 And the scribes and the chief priests heard, and they were seeking how they shall destroy him, for they were afraid of him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching;
021119 and when evening came, he was going forth without the city.
021120 And in the morning, passing by, they saw the fig-tree having been dried up from the roots,
021121 and Peter having remembered saith to him, 'Rabbi, lo, the fig-tree that thou didst curse is dried up.'
021122 And Jesus answering saith to them, 'Have faith of God;
021123 for verily I say to you, that whoever may say to this mount, Be taken up, and be cast into the sea, and may not doubt in his heart, but may believe that the things that he saith do come to pass, it shall be to him whatever he may say.
021124 Because of this I say to you, all whatever -- praying -- ye do ask, believe that ye receive, and it shall be to you.
021125 'And whenever ye may stand praying, forgive, if ye have anything against any one, that your Father also who is in the heavens may forgive you your trespasses;
021126 and, if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in the heavens forgive your trespasses.'
021127 And they come again to Jerusalem, and in the temple, as he is walking, there come unto him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
021128 and they say to him, 'By what authority dost thou these things? and who gave thee this authority that these things thou mayest do?'
021129 And Jesus answering said to them, 'I will question you -- I also -- one word; and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things;
021130 the baptism of John -- from heaven was it? or from men? answer me.'
021131 And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, 'If we may say, From heaven, he will say, Wherefore, then, did ye not believe him?
021132 But if we may say, From men,' -- they were fearing the people, for all were holding John that he was indeed a prophet;
021133 and answering they say to Jesus, 'We have not known;' and Jesus answering saith to them, 'Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.'
021201 And he began to speak to them in similes: 'A man planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around, and digged an under-winevat, and built a tower, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went abroad;
021202 and he sent unto the husbandmen at the due time a servant, that from the husbandmen he may receive from the fruit of the vineyard,
021203 and they, having taken him, did severely beat [him], and did send him away empty.
021204 'And again he sent unto them another servant, and at that one having cast stones, they wounded [him] in the head, and sent away -- dishonoured.
021205 'And again he sent another, and that one they killed; and many others, some beating, and some killing.
021206 'Having yet therefore one son -- his beloved -- he sent also him unto them last, saying -- They will reverence my son;
021207 and those husbandmen said among themselves -- This is the heir, come, we may kill him, and ours shall be the inheritance;
021208 and having taken him, they did kill, and cast [him] forth without the vineyard.
021209 'What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.
021210 And this Writing did ye not read: A stone that the builders rejected, it did become the head of a corner:
021211 from the Lord was this, and it is wonderful in our eyes.'
021212 And they were seeking to lay hold on him, and they feared the multitude, for they knew that against them he spake the simile, and having left him, they went away;
021213 and they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they may ensnare him in discourse,
021214 and they having come, say to him, 'Teacher, we have known that thou art true, and thou art not caring for any one, for thou dost not look to the face of men, but in truth the way of God dost teach; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? may we give, or may we not give?'
021215 And he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, 'Why me do ye tempt? bring me a denary, that I may see;'
021216 and they brought, and he saith to them, 'Whose [is] this image, and the inscription?' and they said to him, 'Caesar's;'
021217 and Jesus answering said to them, 'Give back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;' and they did wonder at him.
021218 And the Sadducees come unto him, who say there is not a rising again, and they questioned him, saying,
021219 'Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if any one's brother may die, and may leave a wife, and may leave no children, that his brother may take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
021220 'There were then seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and dying, he left no seed;
021221 and the second took her, and died, neither left he seed, and the third in like manner,
021222 and the seven took her, and left no seed, last of all died also the woman;
021223 in the rising again, then, whenever they may rise, of which of them shall she be wife -- for the seven had her as wife?'
021224 And Jesus answering said to them, 'Do ye not because of this go astray, not knowing the Writings, nor the power of God?
021225 for when they may rise out of the dead, they neither marry nor are they given in marriage, but are as messengers who are in the heavens.
021226 'And concerning the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the Book of Moses (at The Bush), how God spake to him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;
021227 he is not the God of dead men, but a God of living men; ye then go greatly astray.'
021228 And one of the scribes having come near, having heard them disputing, knowing that he answered them well, questioned him, 'Which is the first command of all?'
021229 and Jesus answered him -- 'The first of all the commands [is], Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one;
021230 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart, and out of thy soul, and out of all thine understanding, and out of all thy strength -- this [is] the first command;
021231 and the second [is] like [it], this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself; -- greater than these there is no other command.'
021232 And the scribe said to him, 'Well, Teacher, in truth thou hast spoken that there is one God, and there is none other but He;
021233 and to love Him out of all the heart, and out of all the understanding, and out of all the soul, and out of all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as one's self, is more than all the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices.'
021234 And Jesus, having seen him that he answered with understanding, said to him, 'Thou art not far from the reign of God;' and no one any more durst question him.
021235 And Jesus answering said, teaching in the temple, 'How say the scribes that the Christ is son of David?
021236 for David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on My right hand, till I place thine enemies -- thy footstool;
021237 therefore David himself saith of him Lord, and whence is he his son?' And the great multitude were hearing him gladly,
021238 and he was saying to them in his teaching, 'Beware of the scribes, who will in long robes to walk, and love salutations in the market-places,
021239 and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in suppers,
021240 who are devouring the widows' houses, and for a pretense are making long prayers; these shall receive more abundant judgment.'
021241 And Jesus having sat down over-against the treasury, was beholding how the multitude do put brass into the treasury, and many rich were putting in much,
021242 and having come, a poor widow did put in two mites, which are a farthing.
021243 And having called near his disciples, he saith to them, 'Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath put in more than all those putting into the treasury;
021244 for all, out of their abundance, put in, but she, out of her want, all that she had put in -- all her living.'
021301 And as he is going forth out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to him, 'Teacher, see! what stones! and what buildings!'
021302 and Jesus answering said to him, 'Seest thou these great buildings? there may not be left a stone upon a stone, that may not be thrown down.'
021303 And as he is sitting at the mount of the Olives, over-against the temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, were questioning him by himself,
021304 'Tell us when these things shall be? and what [is] the sign when all these may be about to be fulfilled?'
021305 And Jesus answering them, began to say, 'Take heed lest any one may lead you astray,
021306 for many shall come in my name, saying -- I am [he], and many they shall lead astray;
021307 and when ye may hear of wars and reports of wars, be not troubled, for these behove to be, but the end [is] not yet;
021308 for nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles; beginnings of sorrows [are] these.
021309 'And take ye heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrims, and to synagogues, ye shall be beaten, and before governors and kings ye shall be set for my sake, for a testimony to them;
021310 and to all the nations it behoveth first that the good news be proclaimed.
021311 'And when they may lead you, delivering up, be not anxious beforehand what ye may speak, nor premeditate, but whatever may be given to you in that hour, that speak ye, for it is not ye who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
021312 'And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father child, and children shall rise up against parents, and shall put them to death,
021313 and ye shall be hated by all because of my name, but he who hath endured to the end -- he shall be saved.
021314 'And when ye may see the abomination of the desolation, that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (whoever is reading let him understand), then those in Judea, let them flee to the mountains;
021315 and he upon the house-top, let him not come down to the house, nor come in to take anything out of his house;
021316 and he who is in the field, let him not turn to the things behind, to take up his garment.
021317 'And wo to those with child, and to those giving suck, in those days;
021318 and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter,
021319 for those days shall be tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation that God created, till now, and may not be;
021320 and if the Lord did not shorten the days, no flesh had been saved; but because of the chosen, whom He did choose to Himself, He did shorten the days.
021321 'And then, if any may say to you, Lo, here [is] the Christ, or, Lo, there, ye may not believe;
021322 for there shall rise false Christs and false prophets, and they shall give signs and wonders, to seduce, if possible, also the chosen;
021323 and ye, take heed; lo, I have foretold you all things.
021324 'But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
021325 and the stars of the heaven shall be falling, and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.
021326 'And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds with much power and glory,
021327 and then he shall send his messengers, and gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the end of the earth unto the end of heaven.
021328 'And from the fig-tree learn ye the simile: when the branch may already become tender, and may put forth the leaves, ye know that nigh is the summer;
021329 so ye, also, when these ye may see coming to pass, ye know that it is nigh, at the doors.
021330 Verily I say to you, that this generation may not pass away till all these things may come to pass;
021331 the heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
021332 'And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known -- not even the messengers who are in the heaven, not even the Son -- except the Father.
021333 Take heed, watch and pray, for ye have not known when the time is;
021334 as a man who is gone abroad, having left his house, and given to his servants the authority, and to each one his work, did command also the porter that he may watch;
021335 watch ye, therefore, for ye have not known when the lord of the house doth come, at even, or at midnight, or at cock-crowing, or at the morning;
021336 lest, having come suddenly, he may find you sleeping;
021337 and what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.'
021401 And the passover and the unleavened food were after two days, and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how, by guile, having taken hold of him, they might kill him;
021402 and they said, 'Not in the feast, lest there shall be a tumult of the people.'
021403 And he, being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, at his reclining (at meat), there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment, of spikenard, very precious, and having broken the alabaster box, did pour on his head;
021404 and there were certain much displeased within themselves, and saying, 'For what hath this waste of the ointment been made?
021405 for this could have been sold for more than three hundred denaries, and given to the poor;' and they were murmuring at her.
021406 And Jesus said, 'Let her alone; why are ye giving her trouble? a good work she wrought on me;
021407 for the poor always ye have with you, and whenever ye may will ye are able to do them good, but me ye have not always;
021408 what she could she did, she anticipated to anoint my body for the embalming.
021409 Verily I say to you, wherever this good news may be proclaimed in the whole world, what also this woman did shall be spoken of -- for a memorial of her.'
021410 And Judas the Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away unto the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them,
021411 and having heard, they were glad, and promised to give him money, and he was seeking how, conveniently, he might deliver him up.
021412 And the first day of the unleavened food, when they were killing the passover, his disciples say to him, 'Where wilt thou, [that,] having gone, we may prepare, that thou mayest eat the passover?'
021413 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith to them, 'Go ye away to the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water, follow him;
021414 and wherever he may go in, say ye to the master of the house -- The Teacher saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where the passover, with my disciples, I may eat?
021415 and he will shew you a large upper room, furnished, prepared -- there make ready for us.'
021416 And his disciples went forth, and came to the city, and found as he said to them, and they made ready the passover.
021417 And evening having come, he cometh with the twelve,
021418 and as they are reclining, and eating, Jesus said, 'Verily I say to you -- one of you, who is eating with me -- shall deliver me up.'
021419 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him, one by one, 'Is it I?' and another, 'Is it I?'
021420 And he answering said to them, 'One of the twelve who is dipping with me in the dish;
021421 the Son of Man doth indeed go, as it hath been written concerning him, but wo to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up; good were it to him if that man had not been born.'
021422 And as they are eating, Jesus having taken bread, having blessed, brake, and gave to them, and said, 'Take, eat; this is my body.'
021423 And having taken the cup, having given thanks, he gave to them, and they drank of it -- all;
021424 and he said to them, 'This is my blood of the new covenant, which for many is being poured out;
021425 verily I say to you, that no more may I drink of the produce of the vine till that day when I may drink it new in the reign of God.'
021426 And having sung an hymn, they went forth to the mount of the Olives,
021427 and Jesus saith to them -- 'All ye shall be stumbled at me this night, because it hath been written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad,
021428 but after my having risen I will go before you to Galilee.'
021429 And Peter said to him, 'And if all shall be stumbled, yet not I;'
021430 And Jesus said to him, 'Verily I say to thee, that to-day, this night, before a cock shall crow twice, thrice thou shalt deny me.'
021431 And he spake the more vehemently, 'If it may be necessary for me to die with thee -- I will in nowise deny thee;' and in like manner also said they all.
021432 And they come to a spot, the name of which [is] Gethsemane, and he saith to his disciples, 'Sit ye here till I may pray;'
021433 and he taketh Peter, and James, and John with him, and began to be amazed, and to be very heavy,
021434 and he saith to them, 'Exceeding sorrowful is my soul -- to death; remain here, and watch.'
021435 And having gone forward a little, he fell upon the earth, and was praying, that, if it be possible the hour may pass from him,
021436 and he said, 'Abba, Father; all things are possible to Thee; make this cup pass from me; but, not what I will, but what Thou.'
021437 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, 'Simon, thou dost sleep! thou wast not able to watch one hour!
021438 Watch ye and pray, that ye may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is forward, but the flesh weak.'
021439 And again having gone away, he prayed, the same word saying;
021440 and having returned, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy, and they had not known what they might answer him.
021441 And he cometh the third time, and saith to them, 'Sleep on henceforth, and rest -- it is over; the hour did come; lo, the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of the sinful;
021442 rise, we may go, lo, he who is delivering me up hath come nigh.'
021443 And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- cometh near Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;
021444 and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them, saying, 'Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is, lay hold on him, and lead him away safely,'
021445 and having come, immediately, having gone near him, he saith, 'Rabbi, Rabbi,' and kissed him.
021446 And they laid on him their hands, and kept hold on him;
021447 and a certain one of those standing by, having drawn the sword, struck the servant of the chief priest, and took off his ear.
021448 And Jesus answering said to them, 'As against a robber ye came out, with swords and sticks, to take me!
021449 daily I was with you in the temple teaching, and ye did not lay hold on me -- but that the Writings may be fulfilled.'
021450 And having left him they all fled;
021451 and a certain young man was following him, having put a linen cloth about [his] naked body, and the young men lay hold on him,
021452 and he, having left the linen cloth, did flee from them naked.
021453 And they led away Jesus unto the chief priest, and come together to him do all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes;
021454 and Peter afar off did follow him, to the inside of the hall of the chief priest, and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself near the fire.
021455 And the chief priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death, and they were not finding,
021456 for many were bearing false testimony against him, and their testimonies were not alike.
021457 And certain having risen up, were bearing false testimony against him, saying --
021458 'We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary made with hands, and by three days, another made without hands I will build;'
021459 and neither so was their testimony alike.
021460 And the chief priest, having risen up in the midst, questioned Jesus, saying, 'Thou dost not answer anything! what do these testify against thee?'
021461 and he was keeping silent, and did not answer anything. Again the chief priest was questioning him, and saith to him, 'Art thou the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed?'
021462 and Jesus said, 'I am; and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming with the clouds, of the heaven.'
021463 And the chief priest, having rent his garments, saith, 'What need have we yet of witnesses?
021464 Ye heard the evil speaking, what appeareth to you?' and they all condemned him to be worthy of death,
021465 and certain began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, 'Prophesy;' and the officers were striking him with their palms.
021466 And Peter being in the hall beneath, there doth come one of the maids of the chief priest,
021467 and having seen Peter warming himself, having looked on him, she said, 'And thou wast with Jesus of Nazareth!'
021468 and he denied, saying, 'I have not known [him], neither do I understand what thou sayest;' and he went forth without to the porch, and a cock crew.
021469 And the maid having seen him again, began to say to those standing near -- 'This is of them;'
021470 and he was again denying. And after a little again, those standing near said to Peter, 'Truly thou art of them, for thou also art a Galilean, and thy speech is alike;'
021471 and he began to anathematize, and to swear -- 'I have not known this man of whom ye speak;'
021472 and a second time a cock crew, and Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him -- 'Before a cock crow twice, thou mayest deny me thrice;' and having thought thereon -- he was weeping.
021501 And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests having made a consultation, with the elders, and scribes, and the whole sanhedrim, having bound Jesus, did lead away, and delivered [him] to Pilate;
021502 and Pilate questioned him, 'Art thou the king of the Jews?' and he answering said to him, 'Thou dost say [it].'
021503 And the chief priests were accusing him of many things, [but he answered nothing.]
021504 And Pilate again questioned him, saying, 'Thou dost not answer anything! lo, how many things they do testify against thee!'
021505 and Jesus did no more answer anything, so that Pilate wondered.
021506 And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner, whomsoever they were asking;
021507 and there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with those making insurrection with him, who had in the insurrection committed murder.
021508 And the multitude having cried out, began to ask for themselves as he was always doing to them,
021509 and Pilate answered them, saying, 'Will ye [that] I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'
021510 for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered him up;
021511 and the chief priests did move the multitude, that he might rather release Barabbas to them.
021512 And Pilate answering, again said to them, 'What, then, will ye [that] I shall do to him whom ye call king of the Jews?'
021513 and they again cried out, 'Crucify him.'
021514 And Pilate said to them, 'Why -- what evil did he?' and they cried out the more vehemently, 'Crucify him;'
021515 and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus -- having scourged [him] -- that he might be crucified.
021516 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, which is Praetorium, and call together the whole band,
021517 and clothe him with purple, and having plaited a crown of thorns, they put [it] on him,
021518 and began to salute him, 'Hail, King of the Jews.'
021519 And they were smiting him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and having bent the knee, were bowing to him,
021520 and when they [had] mocked him, they took the purple from off him, and clothed him in his own garments, and they led him forth, that they may crucify him.
021521 And they impress a certain one passing by -- Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus -- that he may bear his cross,
021522 and they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, 'Place of a skull;'
021523 and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, and he did not receive.
021524 And having crucified him, they were dividing his garments, casting a lot upon them, what each may take;
021525 and it was the third hour, and they crucified him;
021526 and the inscription of his accusation was written above -- 'The King of the Jews.'
021527 And with him they crucify two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on his left,
021528 and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying, 'And with lawless ones he was numbered.'
021529 And those passing by were speaking evil of him, shaking their heads, and saying, 'Ah, the thrower down of the sanctuary, and in three days the builder!
021530 save thyself, and come down from the cross!'
021531 And in like manner also the chief priests, mocking with one another, with the scribes, said, 'Others he saved; himself he is not able to save.
021532 The Christ! the king of Israel -- let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe;' and those crucified with him were reproaching him.
021533 And the sixth hour having come, darkness came over the whole land till the ninth hour,
021534 and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, 'Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani?' which is, being interpreted, 'My God, my God, why didst Thou forsake me?'
021535 And certain of those standing by, having heard, said, 'Lo, Elijah he doth call;'
021536 and one having run, and having filled a spunge with vinegar, having put [it] also on a reed, was giving him to drink, saying, 'Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth come to take him down.'
021537 And Jesus having uttered a loud cry, yielded the spirit,
021538 and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom,
021539 and the centurion who was standing over-against him, having seen that, having so cried out, he yielded the spirit, said, 'Truly this man was Son of God.'
021540 And there were also women afar off beholding, among whom was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,
021541 (who also, when he was in Galilee, were following him, and were ministering to him,) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
021542 And now evening having come, seeing it was the preparation, that is, the fore-sabbath,
021543 Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also himself was waiting for the reign of God, came, boldly entered in unto Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.
021544 And Pilate wondered if he were already dead, and having called near the centurion, did question him if he were long dead,
021545 and having known [it] from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
021546 And he, having brought fine linen, and having taken him down, wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre,
021547 and Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, were beholding where he is laid.
021601 And the sabbath having past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they may anoint him,
021602 and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, they come unto the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun,
021603 and they said among themselves, 'Who shall roll away for us the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?'
021604 And having looked, they see that the stone hath been rolled away -- for it was very great,
021605 and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and they were amazed.
021606 And he saith to them, 'Be not amazed, ye seek Jesus the Nazarene, the crucified: he did rise -- he is not here; lo, the place where they laid him!
021607 and go, say to his disciples, and Peter, that he doth go before you to Galilee; there ye shall see him, as he said to you.'
021608 And, having come forth quickly, they fled from the sepulchre, and trembling and amazement had seized them, and to no one said they anything, for they were afraid.
021609 And he, having risen in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, did appear first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons;
021610 she having gone, told those who had been with him, mourning and weeping;
021611 and they, having heard that he is alive, and was seen by her, did not believe.
021612 And after these things, to two of them, as they are going into a field, walking, he was manifested in another form,
021613 and they having gone, told to the rest; not even them did they believe.
021614 Afterwards, as they are reclining (at meat), he was manifested to the eleven, and did reproach their unbelief and stiffness of heart, because they believed not those having seen him being raised;
021615 and he said to them, 'Having gone to all the world, proclaim the good news to all the creation;
021616 he who hath believed, and hath been baptized, shall be saved; and he who hath not believed, shall be condemned.
021617 'And signs shall accompany those believing these things; in my name demons they shall cast out; with new tongues they shall speak;
021618 serpents they shall take up; and if any deadly thing they may drink, it shall not hurt them; on the ailing they shall lay hands, and they shall be well.'
021619 The Lord, then, indeed, after speaking to them, was received up to the heaven, and sat on the right hand of God;
021620 and they, having gone forth, did preach everywhere, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word, through the signs following. Amen.
030101 Seeing that many did take in hand to set in order a narration of the matters that have been fully assured among us,
030102 as they did deliver to us, who from the beginning became eye-witnesses, and officers of the Word, --
030103 it seemed good also to me, having followed from the first after all things exactly, to write to thee in order, most noble Theophilus,
030104 that thou mayest know the certainty of the things wherein thou wast instructed.
030105 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abijah, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elisabeth;
030106 and they were both righteous before God, going on in all the commands and righteousnesses of the Lord blameless,
030107 and they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.
030108 And it came to pass, in his acting as priest, in the order of his course before God,
030109 according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot was to make perfume, having gone into the sanctuary of the Lord,
030110 and all the multitude of the people were praying without, at the hour of the perfume.
030111 And there appeared to him a messenger of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of the perfume,
030112 and Zacharias, having seen, was troubled, and fear fell on him;
030113 and the messenger said unto him, 'Fear not, Zacharias, for thy supplication was heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear a son to thee, and thou shalt call his name John,
030114 and there shall be joy to thee, and gladness, and many at his birth shall joy,
030115 for he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and strong drink he may not drink, and of the Holy Spirit he shall be full, even from his mother's womb;
030116 and many of the sons of Israel he shall turn to the Lord their God,
030117 and he shall go before Him, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn hearts of fathers unto children, and disobedient ones to the wisdom of righteous ones, to make ready for the Lord, a people prepared.'
030118 And Zacharias said unto the messenger, 'Whereby shall I know this? for I am aged, and my wife is advanced in her days?'
030119 And the messenger answering said to him, 'I am Gabriel, who have been standing near before God, and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to proclaim these good news to thee,
030120 and lo, thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak, till the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou didst not believe my words, that shall be fulfilled in their season.'
030121 And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and wondering at his tarrying in the sanctuary,
030122 and having come out, he was not able to speak to them, and they perceived that a vision he had seen in the sanctuary, and he was beckoning to them, and did remain dumb.
030123 And it came to pass, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went away to his house,
030124 and after those days, his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying --
030125 'Thus hath the Lord done to me, in days in which He looked upon [me], to take away my reproach among men.'
030126 And in the sixth month was the messenger Gabriel sent by God, to a city of Galilee, the name of which [is] Nazareth,
030127 to a virgin, betrothed to a man, whose name [is] Joseph, of the house of David, and the name of the virgin [is] Mary.
030128 And the messenger having come in unto her, said, 'Hail, favoured one, the Lord [is] with thee; blessed [art] thou among women;'
030129 and she, having seen, was troubled at his word, and was reasoning of what kind this salutation may be.
030130 And the messenger said to her, 'Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God;
030131 and lo, thou shalt conceive in the womb, and shalt bring forth a son, and call his name Jesus;
030132 he shall be great, and Son of the Highest he shall be called, and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father,
030133 and he shall reign over the house of Jacob to the ages; and of his reign there shall be no end.'
030134 And Mary said unto the messenger, 'How shall this be, seeing a husband I do not know?'
030135 And the messenger answering said to her, 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, therefore also the holy-begotten thing shall be called Son of God;
030136 and lo, Elisabeth, thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her who was called barren;
030137 because nothing shall be impossible with God.'
030138 And Mary said, 'Lo, the maid-servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to thy saying,' and the messenger went away from her.
030139 And Mary having arisen in those days, went to the hill-country, with haste, to a city of Judea,
030140 and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
030141 And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe did leap in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,
030142 and spake out with a loud voice, and said, 'Blessed [art] thou among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb;
030143 and whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord might come unto me?
030144 for, lo, when the voice of thy salutation came to my ears, leap in gladness did the babe in my womb;
030145 and happy [is] she who did believe, for there shall be a completion to the things spoken to her from the Lord.'
030146 And Mary said, 'My soul doth magnify the Lord,
030147 And my spirit was glad on God my Saviour,
030148 Because He looked on the lowliness of His maid-servant, For, lo, henceforth call me happy shall all the generations,
030149 For He who is mighty did to me great things, And holy [is] His name,
030150 And His kindness [is] to generations of generations, To those fearing Him,
030151 He did powerfully with His arm, He scattered abroad the proud in the thought of their heart,
030152 He brought down the mighty from thrones, And He exalted the lowly,
030153 The hungry He did fill with good, And the rich He sent away empty,
030154 He received again Israel His servant, To remember kindness,
030155 As He spake unto our fathers, To Abraham and to his seed -- to the age.'
030156 And Mary remained with her about three months, and turned back to her house.
030157 And to Elisabeth was the time fulfilled for her bringing forth, and she bare a son,
030158 and the neighbours and her kindred heard that the Lord was making His kindness great with her, and they were rejoicing with her.
030159 And it came to pass, on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child, and they were calling him by the name of his father, Zacharias,
030160 and his mother answering said, 'No, but he shall be called John.'
030161 And they said unto her -- 'There is none among thy kindred who is called by this name,'
030162 and they were making signs to his father, what he would wish him to be called,
030163 and having asked for a tablet, he wrote, saying, 'John is his name;' and they did all wonder;
030164 and his mouth was opened presently, and his tongue, and he was speaking, praising God.
030165 And fear came upon all those dwelling around them, and in all the hill-country of Judea were all these sayings spoken of,
030166 and all who heard did lay them up in their hearts, saying, 'What then shall this child be?' and the hand of the Lord was with him.
030167 And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and did prophesy, saying,
030168 'Blessed [is] the Lord, the God of Israel, Because He did look upon, And wrought redemption for His people,
030169 And did raise an horn of salvation to us, In the house of David His servant,
030170 As He spake by the mouth of His holy prophets, Which have been from the age;
030171 Salvation from our enemies, And out of the hand of all hating us,
030172 To do kindness with our fathers, And to be mindful of His holy covenant,
030173 An oath that He sware to Abraham our father,
030174 To give to us, without fear, Out of the hand of our enemies having been delivered,
030175 To serve Him, in holiness and righteousness Before Him, all the days of our life.
030176 And thou, child, Prophet of the Highest Shalt thou be called; For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, To prepare His ways.
030177 To give knowledge of salvation to His people In remission of their sins,
030178 Through the tender mercies of our God, In which the rising from on high did look upon us,
030179 To give light to those sitting in darkness and death-shade, To guide our feet to a way of peace.'
030180 And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and he was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.
030201 And it came to pass in those days, there went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world be enrolled --
030202 this enrollment first came to pass when Cyrenius was governor of Syria --
030203 and all were going to be enrolled, each to his proper city,
030204 and Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, that is called Bethlehem, because of his being of the house and family of David,
030205 to enroll himself with Mary his betrothed wife, being with child.
030206 And it came to pass, in their being there, the days were fulfilled for her bringing forth,
030207 and she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and wrapped him up, and laid him down in the manger, because there was not for them a place in the guest-chamber.
030208 And there were shepherds in the same region, lodging in the field, and keeping the night-watches over their flock,
030209 and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood over them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they feared a great fear.
030210 And the messenger said to them, 'Fear not, for lo, I bring you good news of great joy, that shall be to all the people --
030211 because there was born to you to-day a Saviour -- who is Christ the Lord -- in the city of David,
030212 and this [is] to you the sign: Ye shall find a babe wrapped up, lying in the manger.'
030213 And suddenly there came with the messenger a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,
030214 'Glory in the highest to God, and upon earth peace, among men -- good will.'
030215 And it came to pass, when the messengers were gone away from them to the heavens, that the men, the shepherds, said unto one another, 'We may go over indeed unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that hath come to pass, that the Lord did make known to us.'
030216 And they came, having hasted, and found both Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger,
030217 and having seen, they made known abroad concerning the saying spoken to them concerning the child.
030218 And all who heard, did wonder concerning the things spoken by the shepherds unto them;
030219 and Mary was preserving all these things, pondering in her heart;
030220 and the shepherds turned back, glorifying and praising God, for all those things they heard and saw, as it was spoken unto them.
030221 And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child, then was his name called Jesus, having been so called by the messenger before his being conceived in the womb.
030222 And when the days of their purification were fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present to the Lord,
030223 as it hath been written in the Law of the Lord, -- 'Every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord,'
030224 and to give a sacrifice, according to that said in the Law of the Lord, 'A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.'
030225 And lo, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name [is] Simeon, and this man is righteous and devout, looking for the comforting of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him,
030226 and it hath been divinely told him by the Holy Spirit -- not to see death before he may see the Christ of the Lord.
030227 And he came in the Spirit to the temple, and in the parents bringing in the child Jesus, for their doing according to the custom of the law regarding him,
030228 then he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and he said,
030229 'Now Thou dost send away Thy servant, Lord, according to Thy word, in peace,
030230 because mine eyes did see Thy salvation,
030231 which Thou didst prepare before the face of all the peoples,
030232 a light to the uncovering of nations, and the glory of Thy people Israel.'
030233 And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things spoken concerning him,
030234 and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, 'Lo, this [one] is set for the falling and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against --
030235 (and also thine own soul shall a sword pass through) -- that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.'
030236 And there was Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, she was much advanced in days, having lived with an husband seven years from her virginity,
030237 and she [is] a widow of about eighty-four years, who did depart not from the temple, with fasts and supplications serving, night and day,
030238 and she, at that hour, having come in, was confessing, likewise, to the Lord, and was speaking concerning him, to all those looking for redemption in Jerusalem.
030239 And when they finished all things, according to the Law of the Lord, they turned back to Galilee, to their city Nazareth;
030240 and the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
030241 And his parents were going yearly to Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover,
030242 and when he became twelve years old, they having gone up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,
030243 and having finished the days, in their returning the child Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother did not know,
030244 and, having supposed him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and were seeking him among the kindred and among the acquaintances,
030245 and not having found him, they turned back to Jerusalem seeking him.
030246 And it came to pass, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them,
030247 and all those hearing him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
030248 And, having seen him, they were amazed, and his mother said unto him, 'Child, why didst thou thus to us? lo, thy father and I, sorrowing, were seeking thee.'
030249 And he said unto them, 'Why [is it] that ye were seeking me? did ye not know that in the things of my Father it behoveth me to be?'
030250 and they did not understand the saying that he spake to them,
030251 and he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and he was subject to them, and his mother was keeping all these sayings in her heart,
030252 and Jesus was advancing in wisdom, and in stature, and in favour with God and men.
030301 And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar -- Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother, tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene --
030302 Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests -- there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness,
030303 and he came to all the region round the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins,
030304 as it hath been written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight make ye His paths;
030305 every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straightness, and the rough become smooth ways;
030306 and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'
030307 Then said he to the multitudes coming forth to be baptised by him, 'Brood of vipers! who did prompt you to flee from the coming wrath?
030308 make, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have a father -- Abraham; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham;
030309 and already also the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree, therefore, not making good fruit is cut down, and to fire it is cast.'
030310 And the multitudes were questioning him, saying, 'What, then, shall we do?'
030311 and he answering saith to them, 'He having two coats -- let him impart to him having none, and he having victuals -- in like manner let him do.'
030312 And there came also tax-gatherers to be baptised, and they said unto him, 'Teacher, what shall we do?'
030313 and he said unto them, 'Exact no more than that directed you.'
030314 And questioning him also were those warring, saying, 'And we, what shall we do?' and he said unto them, 'Do violence to no one, nor accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.'
030315 And the people are looking forward, and all are reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether or not he may be the Christ;
030316 John answered, saying to all, 'I indeed with water do baptise you, but he cometh who is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his sandals -- he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire;
030317 whose winnowing shovel [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat to his storehouse, and the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'
030318 And, therefore, indeed with many other things, exhorting, he was proclaiming good news to the people,
030319 and Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, and concerning all the evils that Herod did,
030320 added also this to all, that he shut up John in the prison.
030321 And it came to pass, in all the people being baptised, Jesus also being baptised, and praying, the heaven was opened,
030322 and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily appearance, as if a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, saying, 'Thou art My Son -- the Beloved, in thee I did delight.'
030323 And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, son of Joseph,
030324 the [son] of Eli, the [son] of Matthat, the [son] of Levi, the [son] of Melchi, the [son] of Janna, the [son] of Joseph,
030325 the [son] of Mattathias, the [son] of Amos, the [son] of Naum, the [son] of Esli,
030326 the [son] of Naggai, the [son] of Maath, the [son] of Mattathias, the [son] of Semei, the [son] of Joseph, the [son] of Juda,
030327 the [son] of Joanna, the [son] of Rhesa, the [son] of Zerubbabel, the [son] of Shealtiel,
030328 the [son] of Neri, the [son] of Melchi, the [son] of Addi, the [son] of Cosam, the [son] of Elmodam, the [son] of Er,
030329 the [son] of Jose, the [son] of Eliezer, the [son] of Jorim, the [son] of Matthat,
030330 the [son] of Levi, the [son] of Simeon, the [son] of Juda, the [son] of Joseph, the [son] of Jonan, the [son] of Eliakim,
030331 the [son] of Melea, the [son] of Mainan, the [son] of Mattatha, the [son] of Nathan,
030332 the [son] of David, the [son] of Jesse, the [son] of Obed, the [son] of Booz, the [son] of Salmon, the [son] of Nahshon,
030333 the [son] of Amminadab, the [son] of Aram, the [son] of Esrom, the [son] of Pharez,
030334 the [son] of Judah, the [son] of Jacob, the [son] of Isaac, the [son] of Abraham, the [son] of Terah, the [son] of Nahor,
030335 the [son] of Serug, the [son] of Reu, the [son] of Peleg, the [son] of Eber,
030336 the [son] of Salah, the [son] of Cainan, the [son] of Arphaxad, the [son] of Shem, the [son] of Noah, the [son] of Lamech,
030337 the [son] of Methuselah, the [son] of Enoch, the [son] of Jared, the [son] of Mahalaleel,
030338 the [son] of Cainan, the [son] of Enos, the [son] of Seth, the [son] of Adam, the [son] of God.
030401 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, turned back from the Jordan, and was brought in the Spirit to the wilderness,
030402 forty days being tempted by the Devil, and he did not eat anything in those days, and they having been ended, he afterward hungered,
030403 and the Devil said to him, 'If Son thou art of God, speak to this stone that it may become bread.'
030404 And Jesus answered him, saying, 'It hath been written, that, not on bread only shall man live, but on every saying of God.'
030405 And the Devil having brought him up to an high mountain, shewed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,
030406 and the Devil said to him, 'To thee I will give all this authority, and their glory, because to me it hath been delivered, and to whomsoever I will, I do give it;
030407 thou, then, if thou mayest bow before me -- all shall be thine.'
030408 And Jesus answering him said, 'Get thee behind me, Adversary, for it hath been written, Thou shalt bow before the Lord thy God, and Him only thou shalt serve.'
030409 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, 'If the Son thou art of God, cast thyself down hence,
030410 for it hath been written -- To His messengers He will give charge concerning thee, to guard over thee,
030411 and -- On hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou mayest dash against a stone thy foot.'
030412 And Jesus answering said to him -- 'It hath been said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.'
030413 And having ended all temptation, the Devil departed from him till a convenient season.
030414 And Jesus turned back in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a fame went forth through all the region round about concerning him,
030415 and he was teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
030416 And he came to Nazareth, where he hath been brought up, and he went in, according to his custom, on the sabbath-day, to the synagogue, and stood up to read;
030417 and there was given over to him a roll of Isaiah the prophet, and having unfolded the roll, he found the place where it hath been written:
030418 'The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, Because He did anoint me; To proclaim good news to the poor, Sent me to heal the broken of heart, To proclaim to captives deliverance, And to blind receiving of sight, To send away the bruised with deliverance,
030419 To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.'
030420 And having folded the roll, having given [it] back to the officer, he sat down, and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing on him.
030421 And he began to say unto them -- 'To-day hath this writing been fulfilled in your ears;'
030422 and all were bearing testimony to him, and were wondering at the gracious words that are coming forth out of his mouth, and they said, 'Is not this the son of Joseph?'
030423 And he said unto them, 'Certainly ye will say to me this simile, Physician, heal thyself; as great things as we heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country;'
030424 and he said, 'Verily I say to you -- No prophet is accepted in his own country;
030425 and of a truth I say to you, Many widows were in the days of Elijah, in Israel, when the heaven was shut for three years and six months, when great famine came on all the land,
030426 and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but -- to Sarepta of Sidon, unto a woman, a widow;
030427 and many lepers were in the time of Elisha the prophet, in Israel, and none of them was cleansed, but -- Naaman the Syrian.'
030428 And all in the synagogue were filled with wrath, hearing these things,
030429 and having risen, they put him forth without the city, and brought him unto the brow of the hill on which their city had been built -- to cast him down headlong,
030430 and he, having gone through the midst of them, went away.
030431 And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbaths,
030432 and they were astonished at his teaching, because his word was with authority.
030433 And in the synagogue was a man, having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a great voice,
030434 saying, 'Away, what -- to us and to thee, Jesus, O Nazarene? thou didst come to destroy us; I have known thee who thou art -- the Holy One of God.'
030435 And Jesus did rebuke him, saying, 'Be silenced, and come forth out of him;' and the demon having cast him into the midst, came forth from him, having hurt him nought;
030436 and amazement came upon all, and they were speaking together, with one another, saying, 'What [is] this word, that with authority and power he doth command the unclean spirits, and they come forth?'
030437 and there was going forth a fame concerning him to every place of the region round about.
030438 And having risen out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon, and the mother-in-law of Simon was pressed with a great fever, and they did ask him about her,
030439 and having stood over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her, and presently, having risen, she was ministering to them.
030440 And at the setting of the sun, all, as many as had any ailing with manifold sicknesses, brought them unto him, and he on each one of them [his] hands having put, did heal them.
030441 And demons also were coming forth from many, crying out and saying -- 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of God;' and rebuking, he did not suffer them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.
030442 And day having come, having gone forth, he went on to a desert place, and the multitudes were seeking him, and they came unto him, and were staying him -- not to go on from them,
030443 and he said unto them -- 'Also to the other cities it behoveth me to proclaim good news of the reign of God, because for this I have been sent;'
030444 and he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
030501 And it came to pass, in the multitude pressing on him to hear the word of God, that he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret,
030502 and he saw two boats standing beside the lake, and the fishers, having gone away from them, were washing the nets,
030503 and having entered into one of the boats, that was Simon's, he asked him to put back a little from the land, and having sat down, was teaching the multitudes out of the boat.
030504 And when he left off speaking, he said unto Simon, 'Put back to the deep, and let down your nets for a draught;'
030505 and Simon answering said to him, 'Master, through the whole night, having laboured, we have taken nothing, but at thy saying I will let down the net.'
030506 And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net was breaking,
030507 and they beckoned to the partners, who [are] in the other boat, having come, to help them; and they came, and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.
030508 And Simon Peter having seen, fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying, 'Depart from me, because I am a sinful man, O lord;'
030509 for astonishment seized him, and all those with him, at the draught of the fishes that they took,
030510 and in like manner also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon; and Jesus said unto Simon, 'Fear not, henceforth thou shalt be catching men;'
030511 and they, having brought the boats upon the land, having left all, did follow him.
030512 And it came to pass, in his being in one of the cities, that lo, a man full of leprosy, and having seen Jesus, having fallen on [his] face, he besought him, saying, 'Sir, if thou mayest will, thou art able to cleanse me;'
030513 and having stretched forth [his] hand, he touched him, having said, 'I will; be thou cleansed;' and immediately the leprosy went away from him.
030514 And he charged him to tell no one, 'But, having gone away, shew thyself to the priest, and bring near for thy cleansing according as Moses directed, for a testimony to them;'
030515 but the more was the report going abroad concerning him, and great multitudes were coming together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities,
030516 and he was withdrawing himself in the desert places and was praying.
030517 And it came to pass, on one of the days, that he was teaching, and there were sitting by Pharisees and teachers of the Law, who were come out of every village of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was -- to heal them.
030518 And lo, men bearing upon a couch a man, who hath been struck with palsy, and they were seeking to bring him in, and to place before him,
030519 and not having found by what way they may bring him in because of the multitude, having gone up on the house-top, through the tiles they let him down, with the little couch, into the midst before Jesus,
030520 and he having seen their faith, said to him, 'Man, thy sins have been forgiven thee.'
030521 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, 'Who is this that doth speak evil words? who is able to forgive sins, except God only?'
030522 And Jesus having known their reasonings, answering, said unto them, 'What reason ye in your hearts?
030523 which is easier -- to say, Thy sins have been forgiven thee? or to say, Arise, and walk?
030524 'And that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority upon the earth to forgive sins -- (he said to the one struck with palsy) -- I say to thee, Arise, and having taken up thy little couch, be going on to thy house.'
030525 And presently having risen before them, having taken up [that] on which he was lying, he went away to his house, glorifying God,
030526 and astonishment took all, and they were glorifying God, and were filled with fear, saying -- 'We saw strange things to-day.'
030527 And after these things he went forth, and beheld a tax-gatherer, by name Levi, sitting at the tax-office, and said to him, 'Be following me;'
030528 and he, having left all, having arisen, did follow him.
030529 And Levi made a great entertainment to him in his house, and there was a great multitude of tax-gatherers and others who were with them reclining (at meat),
030530 and the scribes and the Pharisees among them were murmuring at his disciples, saying, 'Wherefore with tax-gatherers and sinners do ye eat and drink?'
030531 And Jesus answering said unto them, 'They who are well have no need of a physician, but they that are ill:
030532 I came not to call righteous men, but sinners, to reformation.'
030533 And they said unto him, 'Wherefore do the disciples of John fast often, and make supplications -- in like manner also those of the Pharisees -- but thine do eat and drink?'
030534 And he said unto them, 'Are ye able to make the sons of the bride-chamber -- in the bridegroom being with them -- to fast?
030535 but days will come, and, when the bridegroom may be taken away from them, then they shall fast in those days.'
030536 And he spake also a simile unto them -- 'No one a patch of new clothing doth put on old clothing, and if otherwise, the new also doth make a rent, and with the old the patch doth not agree, that [is] from the new.
030537 'And no one doth put new wine into old skins, and if otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be poured out, and the skins will be destroyed;
030538 but new wine into new skins is to be put, and both are preserved together;
030539 and no one having drunk old [wine], doth immediately wish new, for he saith, The old is better.'
030601 And it came to pass, on the second-first sabbath, as he is going through the corn fields, that his disciples were plucking the ears, and were eating, rubbing with the hands,
030602 and certain of the Pharisees said to them, 'Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbaths?'
030603 And Jesus answering said unto them, 'Did ye not read even this that David did, when he hungered, himself and those who are with him,
030604 how he went into the house of God, and the loaves of the presentation did take, and did eat, and gave also to those with him, which it is not lawful to eat, except only to the priests?'
030605 and he said to them, -- 'The Son of Man is lord also of the sabbath.'
030606 And it came to pass also, on another sabbath, that he goeth into the synagogue, and teacheth, and there was there a man, and his right hand was withered,
030607 and the scribes and the Pharisees were watching him, if on the sabbath he will heal, that they might find an accusation against him.
030608 And he himself had known their reasonings, and said to the man having the withered hand, 'Rise, and stand in the midst;' and he having risen, stood.
030609 Then said Jesus unto them, 'I will question you something: Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good, or to do evil? life to save or to kill?'
030610 And having looked round on them all, he said to the man, 'Stretch forth thy hand;' and he did so, and his hand was restored whole as the other;
030611 and they were filled with madness, and were speaking with one another what they might do to Jesus.
030612 And it came to pass in those days, he went forth to the mountain to pray, and was passing the night in the prayer of God,
030613 and when it became day, he called near his disciples, and having chosen from them twelve, whom also he named apostles,
030614 (Simon, whom also he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
030615 Matthew and Thomas, James of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,
030616 Judas of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also became betrayer;)
030617 and having come down with them, he stood upon a level spot, and a crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of the people from all Judea, and Jerusalem, and the maritime Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their sicknesses,
030618 and those harassed by unclean spirits, and they were healed,
030619 and all the multitude were seeking to touch him, because power from him was going forth, and he was healing all.
030620 And he, having lifted up his eyes to his disciples, said: 'Happy the poor -- because yours is the reign of God.
030621 'Happy those hungering now -- because ye shall be filled. 'Happy those weeping now -- because ye shall laugh.
030622 'Happy are ye when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you, and shall reproach, and shall cast forth your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake --
030623 rejoice in that day, and leap, for lo, your reward [is] great in the heaven, for according to these things were their fathers doing to the prophets.
030624 'But wo to you -- the rich, because ye have got your comfort.
030625 'Wo to you who have been filled -- because ye shall hunger. 'Wo to you who are laughing now -- because ye shall mourn and weep.
030626 'Wo to you when all men shall speak well of you -- for according to these things were their fathers doing to false prophets.
030627 'But I say to you who are hearing, Love your enemies, do good to those hating you,
030628 bless those cursing you, and pray for those accusing you falsely;
030629 and to him smiting thee upon the cheek, give also the other, and from him taking away from thee the mantle, also the coat thou mayest not keep back.
030630 'And to every one who is asking of thee, be giving; and from him who is taking away thy goods, be not asking again;
030631 and as ye wish that men may do to you, do ye also to them in like manner;
030632 and -- if ye love those loving you, what grace have ye? for also the sinful love those loving them;
030633 and if ye do good to those doing good to you, what grace have ye? for also the sinful do the same;
030634 and if ye lend [to those] of whom ye hope to receive back, what grace have ye? for also the sinful lend to sinners -- that they may receive again as much.
030635 'But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again, and your reward will be great, and ye shall be sons of the Highest, because He is kind unto the ungracious and evil;
030636 be ye therefore merciful, as also your Father is merciful.
030637 'And judge not, and ye may not be judged; condemn not, and ye may not be condemned; release, and ye shall be released.
030638 'Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed, and shaken, and running over, they shall give into your bosom; for with that measure with which ye measure, it shall be measured to you again.'
030639 And he spake a simile to them, 'Is blind able to lead blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?
030640 A disciple is not above his teacher, but every one perfected shall be as his teacher.
030641 'And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother's eye, and the beam that [is] in thine own eye dost not consider?
030642 or how art thou able to say to thy brother, Brother, suffer, I may take out the mote that [is] in thine eye -- thyself the beam in thine own eye not beholding? Hypocrite, take first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to take out the mote that [is] in thy brother's eye.
030643 'For there is not a good tree making bad fruit, nor a bad tree making good fruit;
030644 for each tree from its own fruit is known, for not from thorns do they gather figs, nor from a bramble do they crop a grape.
030645 'The good man out of the good treasure of his heart doth bring forth that which [is] good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart doth bring forth that which [is] evil; for out of the abounding of the heart doth his mouth speak.
030646 'And why do ye call me, Lord, Lord, and do not what I say?
030647 Every one who is coming unto me, and is hearing my words, and is doing them, I will shew you to whom he is like;
030648 he is like to a man building a house, who did dig, and deepen, and laid a foundation upon the rock, and a flood having come, the stream broke forth on that house, and was not able to shake it, for it had been founded upon the rock.
030649 'And he who heard and did not, is like to a man having builded a house upon the earth, without a foundation, against which the stream brake forth, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house became great.'
030701 And when he completed all his sayings in the ears of the people, he went into Capernaum;
030702 and a certain centurion's servant being ill, was about to die, who was much valued by him,
030703 and having heard about Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, beseeching him, that having come he might thoroughly save his servant.
030704 And they, having come near unto Jesus, were calling upon him earnestly, saying -- 'He is worthy to whom thou shalt do this,
030705 for he doth love our nation, and the synagogue he did build to us.'
030706 And Jesus was going on with them, and now when he is not far distant from the house the centurion sent unto him friends, saying to him, 'Sir, be not troubled, for I am not worthy that under my roof thou mayest enter;
030707 wherefore not even myself thought I worthy to come unto thee, but say in a word, and my lad shall be healed;
030708 for I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this [one], Go, and he goeth; and to another, Be coming, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth [it].'
030709 And having heard these things Jesus wondered at him, and having turned to the multitude following him, he said, 'I say to you, not even in Israel so much faith did I find;'
030710 and those sent, having turned back to the house, found the ailing servant in health.
030711 And it came to pass, on the morrow, he was going on to a city called Nain, and there were going with him many of his disciples, and a great multitude,
030712 and as he came nigh to the gate of the city, then, lo, one dead was being carried forth, an only son of his mother, and she a widow, and a great multitude of the city was with her.
030713 And the Lord having seen her, was moved with compassion towards her, and said to her, 'Be not weeping;'
030714 and having come near, he touched the bier, and those bearing [it] stood still, and he said, 'Young man, to thee I say, Arise;'
030715 and the dead sat up, and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother;
030716 and fear took hold of all, and they were glorifying God, saying -- 'A great prophet hath risen among us,' and -- 'God did look upon His people.'
030717 And the account of this went forth in all Judea about him, and in all the region around.
030718 And the disciples of John told him about all these things,
030719 and John having called near a certain two of his disciples, sent unto Jesus, saying, 'Art thou he who is coming, or for another do we look?'
030720 And having come near to him, the men said, 'John the Baptist sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he who is coming, or for another do we look?'
030721 And in that hour he cured many from sicknesses, and plagues, and evil spirits, and to many blind he granted sight.
030722 And Jesus answering said to them, 'Having gone on, report to John what ye saw and heard, that blind men do see again, lame do walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf do hear, dead are raised, poor have good news proclaimed;
030723 and happy is he whoever may not be stumbled in me.'
030724 And the messengers of John having gone away, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John: 'What have ye gone forth to the wilderness to look on? a reed by the wind shaken?
030725 but what have ye gone forth to see? a man in soft garments clothed? lo, they in splendid apparellings, and living in luxury, are in the houses of kings!
030726 'But what have ye gone forth to see? a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet:
030727 this is he concerning whom it hath been written, Lo, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee;
030728 for I say to you, a greater prophet, among those born of women, than John the Baptist there is not; but the least in the reign of God is greater than he.'
030729 And all the people having heard, and the tax-gatherers, declared God righteous, having been baptized with the baptism of John,
030730 but the Pharisees, and the lawyers, the counsel of God did put away for themselves, not having been baptized by him.
030731 And the Lord said, 'To what, then, shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
030732 they are like to children, to those sitting in a market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We piped to you, and ye did not dance, we mourned to you, and ye did not weep!
030733 'For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He hath a demon;
030734 the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and ye say, Lo, a man, a glutton, and a wine drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners;
030735 and the wisdom was justified from all her children.'
030736 And a certain one of the Pharisees was asking him that he might eat with him, and having gone into the house of the Pharisee he reclined (at meat),
030737 and lo, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having known that he reclineth (at meat) in the house of the Pharisee, having provided an alabaster box of ointment,
030738 and having stood behind, beside his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with the tears, and with the hairs of her head she was wiping, and was kissing his feet, and was anointing with the ointment.
030739 And the Pharisee who did call him, having seen, spake within himself, saying, 'This one, if he were a prophet, would have known who and of what kind [is] the woman who doth touch him, that she is a sinner.'
030740 And Jesus answering said unto him, 'Simon, I have something to say to thee;' and he saith, 'Teacher, say on.'
030741 'Two debtors were to a certain creditor; the one was owing five hundred denaries, and the other fifty;
030742 and they not having [wherewith] to give back, he forgave both; which then of them, say thou, will love him more?'
030743 And Simon answering said, 'I suppose that to whom he forgave the more;' and he said to him, 'Rightly thou didst judge.'
030744 And having turned unto the woman, he said to Simon, 'Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house; water for my feet thou didst not give, but this woman with tears did wet my feet, and with the hairs of her head did wipe;
030745 a kiss to me thou didst not give, but this woman, from what [time] I came in, did not cease kissing my feet;
030746 with oil my head thou didst not anoint, but this woman with ointment did anoint my feet;
030747 therefore I say to thee, her many sins have been forgiven, because she did love much; but to whom little is forgiven, little he doth love.'
030748 And he said to her, 'Thy sins have been forgiven;'
030749 and those reclining with him (at meat) began to say within themselves, 'Who is this, who also doth forgive sins?'
030750 and he said unto the woman, 'Thy faith have saved thee, be going on to peace.'
030801 And it came to pass thereafter, that he was going through every city and village, preaching and proclaiming good news of the reign of God, and the twelve [are] with him,
030802 and certain women, who were healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary who is called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone forth,
030803 and Joanna wife of Chuza, steward of Herod, and Susanna, and many others, who were ministering to him from their substance.
030804 And a great multitude having gathered, and those who from city and city were coming unto him, he spake by a simile:
030805 'The sower went forth to sow his seed, and in his sowing some indeed fell beside the way, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the heaven did devour it.
030806 'And other fell upon the rock, and having sprung up, it did wither, through not having moisture.
030807 'And other fell amidst the thorns, and the thorns having sprung up with it, did choke it.
030808 'And other fell upon the good ground, and having sprung up, it made fruit an hundred fold.' These things saying, he was calling, 'He having ears to hear -- let him hear.'
030809 And his disciples were questioning him, saying, 'What may this simile be?'
030810 And he said, 'To you it hath been given to know the secrets of the reign of God, and to the rest in similes; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
030811 'And this is the simile: The seed is the word of God,
030812 and those beside the way are those hearing, then cometh the Devil, and taketh up the word from their heart, lest having believed, they may be saved.
030813 'And those upon the rock: They who, when they may hear, with joy do receive the word, and these have no root, who for a time believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
030814 'And that which fell to the thorns: These are they who have heard, and going forth, through anxieties, and riches, and pleasures of life, are choked, and bear not to completion.
030815 'And that in the good ground: These are they, who in an upright and good heart, having heard the word, do retain [it], and bear fruit in continuance.
030816 'And no one having lighted a lamp doth cover it with a vessel, or under a couch doth put [it]; but upon a lamp-stand he doth put [it], that those coming in may see the light,
030817 for nothing is secret, that shall not become manifest, nor hid, that shall not be known, and become manifest.
030818 'See, therefore, how ye hear, for whoever may have, there shall be given to him, and whoever may not have, also what he seemeth to have, shall be taken from him.'
030819 And there came unto him his mother and brethren, and they were not able to get to him because of the multitude,
030820 and it was told him, saying, 'Thy mother and thy brethren do stand without, wishing to see thee;'
030821 and he answering said unto them, 'My mother and my brethren! they are those who the word of God are hearing, and doing.'
030822 And it came to pass, on one of the days, that he himself went into a boat with his disciples, and he said unto them, 'We may go over to the other side of the lake;' and they set forth,
030823 and as they are sailing he fell deeply asleep, and there came down a storm of wind to the lake, and they were filling, and were in peril.
030824 And having come near, they awoke him, saying, 'Master, master, we perish;' and he, having arisen, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there came a calm,
030825 and he said to them, 'Where is your faith?' and they being afraid did wonder, saying unto one another, 'Who, then, is this, that even the winds he doth command, and the water, and they obey him?'
030826 And they sailed down to the region of the Gadarenes, that is over-against Galilee,
030827 and he having gone forth upon the land, there met him a certain man, out of the city, who had demons for a long time, and with a garment was not clothed, and in a house was not abiding, but in the tombs,
030828 and having seen Jesus, and having cried out, he fell before him, and with a loud voice, said, 'What -- to me and to thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech thee, mayest thou not afflict me!'
030829 For he commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the man, for many times it had caught him, and he was being bound with chains and fetters -- guarded, and breaking asunder the bonds he was driven by the demons to the deserts.
030830 And Jesus questioned him, saying, 'What is thy name?' and he said, 'Legion,' (because many demons were entered into him,)
030831 and he was calling on him, that he may not command them to go away to the abyss,
030832 and there was there a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain, and they were calling on him, that he might suffer them to enter into these, and he suffered them,
030833 and the demons having gone forth from the man, did enter into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep to the lake, and were choked.
030834 And those feeding [them], having seen what was come to pass, fled, and having gone, told [it] to the city, and to the fields;
030835 and they came forth to see what was come to pass, and they came unto Jesus, and found the man sitting, out of whom the demons had gone forth, clothed, and right-minded, at the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid;
030836 and those also having seen [it], told them how the demoniac was saved.
030837 And the whole multitude of the region of the Gadarenes round about asked him to go away from them, because with great fear they were pressed, and he having entered into the boat, did turn back.
030838 And the man from whom the demons had gone forth was beseeching of him to be with him, and Jesus sent him away, saying,
030839 'Turn back to thy house, and tell how great things God did to thee;' and he went away through all the city proclaiming how great things Jesus did to him.
030840 And it came to pass, in the turning back of Jesus, the multitude received him, for they were all looking for him,
030841 and lo, there came a man, whose name [is] Jairus, and he was a chief of the synagogue, and having fallen at the feet of Jesus, was calling on him to come to his house;
030842 because he had an only daughter about twelve years [old], and she was dying. And in his going away, the multitudes were thronging him,
030843 and a woman, having an issue of blood for twelve years, who, having spent on physicians all her living, was not able to be healed by any,
030844 having come near behind, touched the fringe of his garment, and presently the issue of her blood stood.
030845 And Jesus said, 'Who [is] it that touched me?' and all denying, Peter and those with him said, 'Master, the multitudes press thee, and throng [thee], and thou dost say, Who [is] it that touched me!'
030846 And Jesus said, 'Some one did touch me, for I knew power having gone forth from me.'
030847 And the woman, having seen that she was not hid, trembling, came, and having fallen before him, for what cause she touched him declared to him before all the people, and how she was healed presently;
030848 and he said to her, 'Take courage, daughter, thy faith hath saved thee, be going on to peace.'
030849 While he is yet speaking, there doth come a certain one from the chief of the synagogue's [house], saying to him -- 'Thy daughter hath died, harass not the Teacher;'
030850 and Jesus having heard, answered him, saying, 'Be not afraid, only believe, and she shall be saved.'
030851 And having come to the house, he suffered no one to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father of the child, and the mother;
030852 and they were all weeping, and beating themselves for her, and he said, 'Weep not, she did not die, but doth sleep;
030853 and they were deriding him, knowing that she did die;
030854 and he having put all forth without, and having taken hold of her hand, called, saying, 'Child, arise;'
030855 and her spirit came back, and she arose presently, and he directed that there be given to her to eat;
030856 and her parents were amazed, but he charged them to say to no one what was come to pass.
030901 And having called together his twelve disciples, he gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to cure sicknesses,
030902 and he sent them to proclaim the reign of God, and to heal the ailing.
030903 And he said unto them, 'Take nothing for the way, neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats each;
030904 and into whatever house ye may enter, there remain, and thence depart;
030905 and as many as may not receive you, going forth from that city, even the dust from your feet shake off, for a testimony against them.'
030906 And going forth they were going through the several villages, proclaiming good news, and healing everywhere.
030907 And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things being done by him, and was perplexed, because it was said by certain, that John hath been raised out of the dead;
030908 and by certain, that Elijah did appear, and by others, that a prophet, one of the ancients, was risen;
030909 and Herod said, 'John I did behead, but who is this concerning whom I hear such things?' and he was seeking to see him.
030910 And the apostles having turned back, declared to him how great things they did, and having taken them, he withdrew by himself to a desert place of a city called Bethsaida,
030911 and the multitudes having known did follow him, and having received them, he was speaking to them concerning the reign of God, and those having need of service he cured.
030912 And the day began to decline, and the twelve having come near, said to him, 'Let away the multitude, that having gone to the villages and the fields round about, they may lodge and may find provision, because here we are in a desert place.'
030913 And he said unto them, 'Give ye them to eat;' and they said, 'We have no more than five loaves, and two fishes: except, having gone, we may buy for all this people victuals;'
030914 for they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, 'Cause them to recline in companies, in each fifty;'
030915 and they did so, and made all to recline;
030916 and having taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, having looked up to the heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and was giving to the disciples to set before the multitude;
030917 and they did eat, and were all filled, and there was taken up what was over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.
030918 And it came to pass, as he is praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he questioned them, saying, 'Who do the multitudes say me to be?'
030919 And they answering said, 'John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, that a prophet, one of the ancients, was risen;'
030920 and he said to them, 'And ye -- who do ye say me to be?' and Peter answering said, 'The Christ of God.'
030921 And having charged them, he commanded [them] to say this to no one,
030922 saying -- 'It behoveth the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and to be killed, and the third day to be raised.'
030923 And he said unto all, 'If any one doth will to come after me, let him disown himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me;
030924 for whoever may will to save his life, shall lose it, and whoever may lose his life for my sake, he shall save it;
030925 for what is a man profited, having gained the whole world, and having lost or having forfeited himself?
030926 'For whoever may be ashamed of me, and of my words, of this one shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he may come in his glory, and the Father's, and the holy messengers';
030927 and I say to you, truly, there are certain of those here standing, who shall not taste of death till they may see the reign of God.'
030928 And it came to pass, after these words, as it were eight days, that having taken Peter, and John, and James, he went up to the mountain to pray,
030929 and it came to pass, in his praying, the appearance of his face became altered, and his garment white -- sparkling.
030930 And lo, two men were speaking together with him, who were Moses and Elijah,
030931 who having appeared in glory, spake of his outgoing that he was about to fulfil in Jerusalem,
030932 but Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep, and having waked, they saw his glory, and the two men standing with him.
030933 And it came to pass, in their parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, 'Master, it is good to us to be here; and we may make three booths, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,' not knowing what he saith:
030934 and as he was speaking these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them, and they feared in their entering into the cloud,
030935 and a voice came out of the cloud saying, 'This is My Son -- the Beloved; hear ye him;'
030936 and when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone; and they were silent, and declared to no one in those days anything of what they have seen.
030937 And it came to pass on the next day, they having come down from the mount, there met him a great multitude,
030938 and lo, a man from the multitude cried out, saying, 'Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son, because he is my only begotten;
030939 and lo, a spirit doth take him, and suddenly he doth cry out, and it teareth him, with foaming, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him,
030940 and I besought thy disciples that they might cast it out, and they were not able.'
030941 And Jesus answering said, 'O generation, unstedfast and perverse, till when shall I be with you, and suffer you? bring near hither thy son;'
030942 and as he is yet coming near, the demon rent him, and tore [him] sore, and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the youth, and gave him back to his father.
030943 And they were all amazed at the greatness of God, and while all are wondering at all things that Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
030944 'Lay ye to your ears these words, for the Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men.'
030945 And they were not knowing this saying, and it was veiled from them, that they might not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
030946 And there entered a reasoning among them, this, Who may be greater of them?
030947 and Jesus having seen the reasoning of their heart, having taken hold of a child, set him beside himself,
030948 and said to them, 'Whoever may receive this child in my name, doth receive me, and whoever may receive me, doth receive Him who sent me, for he who is least among you all -- he shall be great.'
030949 And John answering said, 'Master, we saw a certain one in thy name casting forth the demons, and we forbade him, because he doth not follow with us;'
030950 and Jesus said unto him, 'Forbid not, for he who is not against us, is for us.'
030951 And it came to pass, in the completing of the days of his being taken up, that he fixed his face to go on to Jerusalem,
030952 and he sent messengers before his face, and having gone on, they went into a village of Samaritans, to make ready for him,
030953 and they did not receive him, because his face was going on to Jerusalem.
030954 And his disciples James and John having seen, said, 'Sir, wilt thou [that] we may command fire to come down from the heaven, and to consume them, as also Elijah did?'
030955 and having turned, he rebuked them, and said, 'Ye have not known of what spirit ye are;
030956 for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save;' and they went on to another village.
030957 And it came to pass, as they are going on in the way, a certain one said unto him, 'I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go, sir;'
030958 and Jesus said to him, 'The foxes have holes, and the fowls of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not where he may recline the head.'
030959 And he said unto another, 'Be following me;' and he said, 'Sir, permit me, having gone away, first to bury my father;'
030960 and Jesus said to him, 'Suffer the dead to bury their own dead, and thou, having gone away, publish the reign of God.'
030961 And another also said, 'I will follow thee, sir, but first permit me to take leave of those in my house;'
030962 and Jesus said unto him, 'No one having put his hand on a plough, and looking back, is fit for the reign of God.'
031001 And after these things, the Lord did appoint also other seventy, and sent them by twos before his face, to every city and place whither he himself was about to come,
031002 then said he unto them, 'The harvest indeed [is] abundant, but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.
031003 'Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves;
031004 carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way;
031005 and into whatever house ye do enter, first say, Peace to this house;
031006 and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall turn back.
031007 'And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things they have, for worthy [is] the workman of his hire; go not from house to house,
031008 and into whatever city ye enter, and they may receive you, eat the things set before you,
031009 and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of God hath come nigh to you.
031010 'And into whatever city ye do enter, and they may not receive you, having gone forth to its broad places, say,
031011 And the dust that hath cleaved to us, from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the reign of God hath come nigh to you;
031012 and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city.
031013 'Wo to thee, Chorazin; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had reformed;
031014 but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you.
031015 'And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades thou shalt be brought down.
031016 'He who is hearing you, doth hear me; and he who is putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting me away, doth put away Him who sent me.'
031017 And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, 'Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;'
031018 and he said to them, 'I was beholding the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen;
031019 lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by any means shall hurt you;
031020 but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens.'
031021 In that hour was Jesus glad in the Spirit, and said, 'I do confess to thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that Thou didst hide these things from wise men and understanding, and didst reveal them to babes; yes, Father, because so it became good pleasure before Thee.
031022 'All things were delivered up to me by my Father, and no one doth know who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whom the Son may wish to reveal [Him].'
031023 And having turned unto the disciples, he said, by themselves, 'Happy the eyes that are perceiving what ye perceive;
031024 for I say to you, that many prophets and kings did wish to see what ye perceive, and did not see, and to hear what ye hear, and did not hear.'
031025 And lo, a certain lawyer stood up, trying him, and saying, 'Teacher, what having done, life age-during shall I inherit?'
031026 And he said unto him, 'In the law what hath been written? how dost thou read?'
031027 And he answering said, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart, and out of all thy soul, and out of all thy strength, and out of all thy understanding, and thy neighbour as thyself.'
031028 And he said to him, 'Rightly thou didst answer; this do, and thou shalt live.'
031029 And he, willing to declare himself righteous, said unto Jesus, 'And who is my neighbour?'
031030 and Jesus having taken up [the word], said, 'A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and having stripped him and inflicted blows, they went away, leaving [him] half dead.
031031 'And by a coincidence a certain priest was going down in that way, and having seen him, he passed over on the opposite side;
031032 and in like manner also, a Levite, having been about the place, having come and seen, passed over on the opposite side.
031033 'But a certain Samaritan, journeying, came along him, and having seen him, he was moved with compassion,
031034 and having come near, he bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and having lifted him up on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and was careful of him;
031035 and on the morrow, going forth, taking out two denaries, he gave to the innkeeper, and said to him, Be careful of him, and whatever thou mayest spend more, I, in my coming again, will give back to thee.
031036 'Who, then, of these three, seemeth to thee to have become neighbour of him who fell among the robbers?'
031037 and he said, 'He who did the kindness with him,' then Jesus said to him, 'Be going on, and thou be doing in like manner.'
031038 And it came to pass, in their going on, that he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman, by name Martha, did receive him into her house,
031039 and she had also a sister, called Mary, who also, having seated herself beside the feet of Jesus, was hearing the word,
031040 and Martha was distracted about much serving, and having stood by him, she said, 'Sir, dost thou not care that my sister left me alone to serve? say then to her, that she may partake along with me.'
031041 And Jesus answering said to her, 'Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and disquieted about many things,
031042 but of one thing there is need, and Mary the good part did choose, that shall not be taken away from her.'
031101 And it came to pass, in his being in a certain place praying, as he ceased, a certain one of his disciples said unto him, 'Sir, teach us to pray, as also John taught his disciples.'
031102 And he said to them, 'When ye may pray, say ye: Our Father who art in the heavens; hallowed be Thy name: Thy reign come; Thy will come to pass, as in heaven also on earth;
031103 our appointed bread be giving us daily;
031104 and forgive us our sins, for also we ourselves forgive every one indebted to us; and mayest Thou not bring us into temptation; but do Thou deliver us from the evil.'
031105 And he said unto them, 'Who of you shall have a friend, and shall go on unto him at midnight, and may say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,
031106 seeing a friend of mine came out of the way unto me, and I have not what I shall set before him,
031107 and he from within answering may say, Do not give me trouble, already the door hath been shut, and my children with me are in the bed, I am not able, having risen, to give to thee.
031108 'I say to you, even if he will not give to him, having risen, because of his being his friend, yet because of his importunity, having risen, he will give him as many as he doth need;
031109 and I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you;
031110 for every one who is asking doth receive; and he who is seeking doth find; and to him who is knocking it shall be opened.
031111 'And of which of you -- the father -- if the son shall ask a loaf, a stone will he present to him? and if a fish, will he instead of a fish, a serpent present to him?
031112 and if he may ask an egg, will he present to him a scorpion?
031113 If, then, ye, being evil, have known good gifts to be giving to your children, how much more shall the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those asking Him!'
031114 And he was casting forth a demon, and it was dumb, and it came to pass, the demon having gone forth, the dumb man spake, and the multitudes wondered,
031115 and certain of them said, 'By Beelzeboul, ruler of the demons, he doth cast forth the demons;'
031116 and others, tempting, a sign out of heaven from him were asking.
031117 And he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, 'Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated; and house against house doth fall;
031118 and if also the Adversary against himself was divided, how shall his kingdom be made to stand? for ye say, by Beelzeboul is my casting forth the demons.
031119 'But if I by Beelzeboul cast forth the demons -- your sons, by whom do they cast forth? because of this your judges they shall be;
031120 but if by the finger of God I cast forth the demons, then come unawares upon you did the reign of God.
031121 'When the strong man armed may keep his hall, in peace are his goods;
031122 but when the stronger than he, having come upon [him], may overcome him, his whole-armour he doth take away in which he had trusted, and his spoils he distributeth;
031123 he who is not with me is against me, and he who is not gathering with me doth scatter.
031124 'When the unclean spirit may go forth from the man it walketh through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding, it saith, I will turn back to my house whence I came forth;
031125 and having come, it findeth [it] swept and adorned;
031126 then doth it go, and take to it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and having entered, they dwell there, and the last of that man becometh worst than the first.'
031127 And it came to pass, in his saying these things, a certain woman having lifted up the voice out of the multitude, said to him, 'Happy the womb that carried thee, and the paps that thou didst suck!'
031128 And he said, 'Yea, rather, happy those hearing the word of God, and keeping [it]!'
031129 And the multitudes crowding together upon him, he began to say, 'This generation is evil, a sign it doth seek after, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet,
031130 for as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also shall the Son of Man be to this generation.
031131 'A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo, greater than Solomon here!
031132 'Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, because they reformed at the proclamation of Jonah; and lo, greater than Jonah here!
031133 'And no one having lighted a lamp, doth put [it] in a secret place, nor under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, that those coming in may behold the light.
031134 'The lamp of the body is the eye, when then thine eye may be simple, thy whole body also is lightened; and when it may be evil, thy body also is darkened;
031135 take heed, then, lest the light that [is] in thee be darkness;
031136 if then thy whole body is lightened, not having any part darkened, the whole shall be lightened, as when the lamp by the brightness may give thee light.'
031137 And in [his] speaking, a certain Pharisee was asking him that he might dine with him, and having gone in, he reclined (at meat),
031138 and the Pharisee having seen, did wonder that he did not first baptize himself before the dinner.
031139 And the Lord said unto him, 'Now do ye, the Pharisees, the outside of the cup and of the plate make clean, but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness;
031140 unthinking! did not He who made the outside also the inside make?
031141 But what ye have give ye [as] alms, and, lo, all things are clean to you.
031142 'But wo to you, the Pharisees, because ye tithe the mint, and the rue, and every herb, and ye pass by the judgment, and the love of God; these things it behoveth to do, and those not to be neglecting.
031143 'Wo to you, the Pharisees, because ye love the first seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the market-places.
031144 'Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye are as the unseen tombs, and the men walking above have not known.'
031145 And one of the lawyers answering, saith to him, 'Teacher, these things saying, us also thou dost insult;'
031146 and he said, 'And to you, the lawyers, wo! because ye burden men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves with one of your fingers do not touch the burdens.
031147 'Wo to you, because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
031148 Then do ye testify, and are well pleased with the works of your fathers, because they indeed killed them, and ye do build their tombs;
031149 because of this also the wisdom of God said: I will send to them prophets, and apostles, and some of them they shall kill and persecute,
031150 that the blood of all the prophets, that is being poured forth from the foundation of the world, may be required from this generation;
031151 from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, who perished between the altar and the house; yes, I say to you, It shall be required from this generation.
031152 'Wo to you, the lawyers, because ye took away the key of the knowledge; yourselves ye did not enter; and those coming in, ye did hinder.'
031153 And in his speaking these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began fearfully to urge and to press him to speak about many things,
031154 laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
031201 At which time the myriads of the multitude having been gathered together, so as to tread upon one another, he began to say unto his disciples, first, 'Take heed to yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy;
031202 and there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known;
031203 because whatever in the darkness ye said, in the light shall be heard: and what to the ear ye spake in the inner-chambers, shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops.
031204 'And I say to you, my friends, be not afraid of those killing the body, and after these things are not having anything over to do;
031205 but I will show to you, whom ye may fear; Fear him who, after the killing, is having authority to cast to the gehenna; yes, I say to you, Fear ye Him.
031206 'Are not five sparrows sold for two assars? and one of them is not forgotten before God,
031207 but even the hairs of your head have been all numbered; therefore fear ye not, than many sparrows ye are of more value.
031208 'And I say to you, Every one -- whoever may confess with me before men, the Son of Man also shall confess with him before the messengers of God,
031209 and he who hath denied me before men, shall be denied before the messengers of God,
031210 and every one whoever shall say a word to the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven to him, but to him who to the Holy Spirit did speak evil, it shall not be forgiven.
031211 'And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye may reply, or what ye may say,
031212 for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that hour what it behoveth [you] to say.'
031213 And a certain one said to him, out of the multitude, 'Teacher, say to my brother to divide with me the inheritance.'
031214 And he said to him, 'Man, who set me a judge or a divider over you?'
031215 And he said unto them, 'Observe, and beware of the covetousness, because not in the abundance of one's goods is his life.'
031216 And he spake a simile unto them, saying, 'Of a certain rich man the field brought forth well;
031217 and he was reasoning within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where I shall gather together my fruits?
031218 and he said, This I will do, I will take down my storehouses, and greater ones I will build, and I will gather together there all my products and my good things,
031219 and I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many good things laid up for many years, be resting, eat, drink, be merry.
031220 'And God said to him, Unthinking one! this night thy soul they shall require from thee, and what things thou didst prepare -- to whom shall they be?
031221 so [is] he who is treasuring up to himself, and is not rich toward God.'
031222 And he said unto his disciples, 'Because of this, to you I say, Be not anxious for your life, what ye may eat; nor for the body, what ye may put on;
031223 the life is more than the nourishment, and the body than the clothing.
031224 'Consider the ravens, that they sow not, nor reap, to which there is no barn nor storehouse, and God doth nourish them; how much better are ye than the fowls?
031225 and who of you, being anxious, is able to add to his age one cubit?
031226 If, then, ye are not able for the least -- why for the rest are ye anxious?
031227 'Consider the lilies, how do they grow? they labour not, nor do they spin, and I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these;
031228 and if the herbage in the field, that to-day is, and to-morrow into an oven is cast, God doth so clothe, how much more you -- ye of little faith?
031229 'And ye -- seek not what ye may eat, or what ye may drink, and be not in suspense,
031230 for all these things do the nations of the world seek after, and your Father hath known that ye have need of these things;
031231 but, seek ye the reign of God, and all these things shall be added to you.
031232 'Fear not, little flock, because your Father did delight to give you the reign;
031233 sell your goods, and give alms, make to yourselves bags that become not old, a treasure unfailing in the heavens, where thief doth not come near, nor moth destroy;
031234 for where your treasure is, there also your heart will be.
031235 'Let your loins be girded, and the lamps burning,
031236 and ye like to men waiting for their lord, when he shall return out of the wedding feasts, that he having come and knocked, immediately they may open to him.
031237 'Happy those servants, whom the lord, having come, shall find watching; verily I say to you, that he will gird himself, and will cause them to recline (at meat), and having come near, will minister to them;
031238 and if he may come in the second watch, and in the third watch he may come, and may find [it] so, happy are those servants.
031239 'And this know, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief doth come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through;
031240 and ye, then, become ye ready, because at the hour ye think not, the Son of Man doth come.'
031241 And Peter said to him, 'Sir, unto us this simile dost thou speak, or also unto all?'
031242 And the Lord said, 'Who, then, is the faithful and prudent steward whom the lord shall set over his household, to give in season the wheat measure?
031243 Happy that servant, whom his lord, having come, shall find doing so;
031244 truly I say to you, that over all his goods he will set him.
031245 'And if that servant may say in his heart, My lord doth delay to come, and may begin to beat the men-servants and the maid-servants, to eat also, and to drink, and to be drunken;
031246 the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he doth not look for [him], and in an hour that he doth not know, and will cut him off, and his portion with the unfaithful he will appoint.
031247 'And that servant, who having known his lord's will, and not having prepared, nor having gone according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes,
031248 and he who, not having known, and having done things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few; and to every one to whom much was given, much shall be required from him; and to whom they did commit much, more abundantly they will ask of him.
031249 'Fire I came to cast to the earth, and what will I if already it was kindled?
031250 but I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I pressed till it may be completed!
031251 'Think ye that peace I came to give in the earth? no, I say to you, but rather division;
031252 for there shall be henceforth five in one house divided -- three against two, and two against three;
031253 a father shall be divided against a son, and a son against a father, a mother against a daughter, and a daughter against a mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.'
031254 And he said also to the multitudes, 'When ye may see the cloud rising from the west, immediately ye say, A shower doth come, and it is so;
031255 and when -- a south wind blowing, ye say, that there will be heat, and it is;
031256 hypocrites! the face of the earth and of the heaven ye have known to make proof of, but this time -- how do ye not make proof of [it]?
031257 'And why, also, of yourselves, judge ye not what is righteous?
031258 for, as thou art going away with thy opponent to the ruler, in the way give diligence to be released from him, lest he may drag thee unto the judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and the officer may cast thee into prison;
031259 I say to thee, thou mayest not come forth thence till even the last mite thou mayest give back.'
031301 And there were present certain at that time, telling him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate did mingle with their sacrifices;
031302 and Jesus answering said to them, 'Think ye that these Galileans became sinners beyond all the Galileans, because they have suffered such things?
031303 No -- I say to you, but, if ye may not reform, all ye even so shall perish.
031304 'Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; think ye that these became debtors beyond all men who are dwelling in Jerusalem?
031305 No -- I say to you, but, if ye may not reform, all ye in like manner shall perish.'
031306 And he spake this simile: 'A certain one had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit in it, and he did not find;
031307 and he said unto the vine-dresser, Lo, three years I come seeking fruit in this fig-tree, and do not find, cut it off, why also the ground doth it render useless?
031308 'And he answering saith to him, Sir, suffer it also this year, till that I may dig about it, and cast in dung;
031309 and if indeed it may bear fruit --; and if not so, thereafter thou shalt cut it off.'
031310 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath,
031311 and lo, there was a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bowed together, and not able to bend back at all,
031312 and Jesus having seen her, did call [her] near, and said to her, 'Woman, thou hast been loosed from thy infirmity;'
031313 and he laid on her [his] hands, and presently she was set upright, and was glorifying God.
031314 And the chief of the synagogue answering -- much displeased that on the sabbath Jesus healed -- said to the multitude, 'Six days there are in which it behoveth [us] to be working; in these, then, coming, be healed, and not on the sabbath-day.'
031315 Then the Lord answered him and said, 'Hypocrite, doth not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass from the stall, and having led away, doth water [it]?
031316 and this one, being a daughter of Abraham, whom the Adversary bound, lo, eighteen years, did it not behove to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?'
031317 And he saying these things, all who were opposed to him were being ashamed, and all the multitude were rejoicing over all the glorious things that are being done by him.
031318 And he said, 'To what is the reign of God like? and to what shall I liken it?
031319 It is like to a grain of mustard, which a man having taken, did cast into his garden, and it increased, and came to a great tree, and the fowls of the heavens did rest in its branches.'
031320 And again he said, 'To what shall I liken the reign of God?
031321 It is like leaven, which a woman, having taken, did hide in three measures of meal, till that all was leavened.'
031322 And he was going through cities and villages, teaching, and making progress toward Jerusalem;
031323 and a certain one said to him, 'Sir, are those saved few?' and he said unto them,
031324 'Be striving to go in through the straight gate, because many, I say to you, will seek to go in, and shall not be able;
031325 from the time the master of the house may have risen up, and may have shut the door, and ye may begin without to stand, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, lord, open to us, and he answering shall say to you, I have not known you whence ye are,
031326 then ye may begin to say, We did eat before thee, and did drink, and in our broad places thou didst teach;
031327 and he shall say, I say to you, I have not known you whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of the unrighteousness.
031328 'There shall be there the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth, when ye may see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the reign of God, and yourselves being cast out without;
031329 and they shall come from east and west, and from north and south, and shall recline in the reign of God,
031330 and lo, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.'
031331 On that day there came near certain Pharisees, saying to him, 'Go forth, and be going on hence, for Herod doth wish to kill thee;'
031332 and he said to them, 'Having gone, say to this fox, Lo, I cast forth demons, and perfect cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third [day] I am being perfected;
031333 but it behoveth me to-day, and to-morrow, and the [day] following, to go on, because it is not possible for a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem.
031334 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that is killing the prophets, and stoning those sent unto her, how often did I will to gather together thy children, as a hen her brood under the wings, and ye did not will.
031335 'Lo, your house is being left to you desolate, and verily I say to you -- ye may not see me, till it may come, when ye may say, Blessed [is] he who is coming in the name of the Lord.'
031401 And it came to pass, on his going into the house of a certain one of the chiefs of the Pharisees, on a sabbath, to eat bread, that they were watching him,
031402 and lo, there was a certain dropsical man before him;
031403 and Jesus answering spake to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, 'Is it lawful on the sabbath-day to heal?'
031404 and they were silent, and having taken hold of [him], he healed him, and let [him] go;
031405 and answering them he said, 'Of which of you shall an ass or ox fall into a pit, and he will not immediately draw it up on the sabbath-day?'
031406 and they were not able to answer him again unto these things.
031407 And he spake a simile unto those called, marking how they were choosing out the first couches, saying unto them,
031408 'When thou mayest be called by any one to marriage-feasts, thou mayest not recline on the first couch, lest a more honourable than thou may have been called by him,
031409 and he who did call thee and him having come shall say to thee, Give to this one place, and then thou mayest begin with shame to occupy the last place.
031410 'But, when thou mayest be called, having gone on, recline in the last place, that when he who called thee may come, he may say to thee, Friend, come up higher; then thou shalt have glory before those reclining with thee;
031411 because every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.'
031412 And he said also to him who did call him, 'When thou mayest make a dinner or a supper, be not calling thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kindred, nor rich neighbours, lest they may also call thee again, and a recompense may come to thee;
031413 but when thou mayest make a feast, be calling poor, maimed, lame, blind,
031414 and happy thou shalt be, because they have not to recompense thee, for it shall be recompensed to thee in the rising again of the righteous.'
031415 And one of those reclining with him, having heard these things, said to him, 'Happy [is] he who shall eat bread in the reign of God;'
031416 and he said to him, 'A certain man made a great supper, and called many,
031417 and he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to those having been called, Be coming, because now are all things ready.
031418 'And they began with one consent all to excuse themselves: The first said to him, A field I bought, and I have need to go forth and see it; I beg of thee, have me excused.
031419 'And another said, Five yoke of oxen I bought, and I go on to prove them; I beg of thee, have me excused:
031420 and another said, A wife I married, and because of this I am not able to come.
031421 'And that servant having come, told to his lord these things, then the master of the house, having been angry, said to his servant, Go forth quickly to the broad places and lanes of the city, and the poor, and maimed, and lame, and blind, bring in hither.
031422 'And the servant said, Sir, it hath been done as thou didst command, and still there is room.
031423 'And the lord said unto the servant, Go forth to the ways and hedges, and constrain to come in, that my house may be filled;
031424 for I say to you, that none of those men who have been called shall taste of my supper.'
031425 And there were going on with him great multitudes, and having turned, he said unto them,
031426 'If any one doth come unto me, and doth not hate his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and yet even his own life, he is not able to be my disciple;
031427 and whoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, is not able to be my disciple.
031428 'For who of you, willing to build a tower, doth not first, having sat down, count the expense, whether he have the things for completing?
031429 lest that he having laid a foundation, and not being able to finish, all who are beholding may begin to mock him,
031430 saying -- This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
031431 'Or what king going on to engage with another king in war, doth not, having sat down, first consult if he be able with ten thousand to meet him who with twenty thousand is coming against him?
031432 and if not so -- he being yet a long way off -- having sent an embassy, he doth ask the things for peace.
031433 'So, then, every one of you who doth not take leave of all that he himself hath, is not able to be my disciple.
031434 'The salt [is] good, but if the salt doth become tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned?
031435 neither for land nor for manure is it fit -- they cast it without. He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.'
031501 And all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were coming nigh to him, to hear him,
031502 and the Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring, saying -- This one doth receive sinners, and doth eat with them.'
031503 And he spake unto them this simile, saying,
031504 'What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost one out of them, doth not leave behind the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go on after the lost one, till he may find it?
031505 and having found, he doth lay [it] on his shoulders rejoicing,
031506 and having come to the house, he doth call together the friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, because I found my sheep -- the lost one.
031507 'I say to you, that so joy shall be in the heaven over one sinner reforming, rather than over ninety-nine righteous men, who have no need of reformation.
031508 'Or what woman having ten drachms, if she may lose one drachm, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek carefully till that she may find?
031509 and having found, she doth call together the female friends and the neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I found the drachm that I lost.
031510 'So I say to you, joy doth come before the messengers of God over one sinner reforming.'
031511 And he said, 'A certain man had two sons,
031512 and the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the portion of the substance falling to [me], and he divided to them the living.
031513 'And not many days after, having gathered all together, the younger son went abroad to a far country, and there he scattered his substance, living riotously;
031514 and he having spent all, there came a mighty famine on that country, and himself began to be in want;
031515 and having gone on, he joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him to the fields to feed swine,
031516 and he was desirous to fill his belly from the husks that the swine were eating, and no one was giving to him.
031517 'And having come to himself, he said, How many hirelings of my father have a superabundance of bread, and I here with hunger am perishing!
031518 having risen, I will go on unto my father, and will say to him, Father, I did sin -- to the heaven, and before thee,
031519 and no more am I worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hirelings.
031520 'And having risen, he went unto his own father, and he being yet far distant, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and having ran he fell upon his neck and kissed him;
031521 and the son said to him, Father, I did sin -- to the heaven, and before thee, and no more am I worthy to be called thy son.
031522 'And the father said unto his servants, Bring forth the first robe, and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand, and sandals for the feet;
031523 and having brought the fatted calf, kill [it], and having eaten, we may be merry,
031524 because this my son was dead, and did live again, and he was lost, and was found; and they began to be merry.
031525 'And his elder son was in a field, and as, coming, he drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing,
031526 and having called near one of the young men, he was inquiring what these things might be,
031527 and he said to him -- Thy brother is arrived, and thy father did kill the fatted calf, because in health he did receive him back.
031528 'And he was angry, and would not go in, therefore his father, having come forth, was entreating him;
031529 and he answering said to the father, Lo, so many years I do serve thee, and never thy command did I transgress, and to me thou didst never give a kid, that with my friends I might make merry;
031530 but when thy son -- this one who did devour thy living with harlots -- came, thou didst kill to him the fatted calf.
031531 'And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and all my things are thine;
031532 but to be merry, and to be glad, it was needful, because this thy brother was dead, and did live again, he was lost, and was found.'
031601 And he said also unto his disciples, 'A certain man was rich, who had a steward, and he was accused to him as scattering his goods;
031602 and having called him, he said to him, What [is] this I hear about thee? render the account of thy stewardship, for thou mayest not any longer be steward.
031603 'And the steward said in himself, What shall I do, because my lord doth take away the stewardship from me? to dig I am not able, to beg I am ashamed: --
031604 I have known what I shall do, that, when I may be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me to their houses.
031605 'And having called near each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much dost thou owe to my lord?
031606 and he said, A hundred baths of oil; and he said to him, Take thy bill, and having sat down write fifty.
031607 'Afterward to another he said, And thou, how much dost thou owe? and he said, A hundred cors of wheat; and he saith to him, Take thy bill, and write eighty.
031608 'And the lord commended the unrighteous steward that he did prudently, because the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of the light, in respect to their generation.
031609 and I say to you, Make to yourselves friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye may fail, they may receive you to the age-during tabernacles.
031610 'He who is faithful in the least, [is] also faithful in much; and he who in the least [is] unrighteous, is also unrighteous in much;
031611 if, then, in the unrighteous mammon ye became not faithful -- the true who will entrust to you?
031612 and if in the other's ye became not faithful -- your own, who shall give to you?
031613 'No domestic is able to serve two lords, for either the one he will hate, and the other he will love; or one he will hold to, and of the other he will be heedless; ye are not able to serve God and mammon.'
031614 And also the Pharisees, being lovers of money, were hearing all these things, and were deriding him,
031615 and he said to them, 'Ye are those declaring yourselves righteous before men, but God doth know your hearts; because that which among men is high, [is] abomination before God;
031616 the law and the prophets [are] till John; since then the reign of God is proclaimed good news, and every one doth press into it;
031617 and it is easier to the heaven and the earth to pass away, than of the law one tittle to fall.
031618 'Every one who is sending away his wife, and marrying another, doth commit adultery; and every one who is marrying her sent away from a husband doth commit adultery.
031619 'And -- a certain man was rich, and was clothed in purple and fine linen, making merry sumptuously every day,
031620 and there was a certain poor man, by name Lazarus, who was laid at his porch, full of sores,
031621 and desiring to be filled from the crumbs that are falling from the table of the rich man; yea, also the dogs, coming, were licking his sores.
031622 'And it came to pass, that the poor man died, and that he was carried away by the messengers to the bosom of Abraham -- and the rich man also died, and was buried;
031623 and in the hades having lifted up his eyes, being in torments, he doth see Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom,
031624 and having cried, he said, Father Abraham, deal kindly with me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and may cool my tongue, because I am distressed in this flame.
031625 'And Abraham said, Child, remember that thou did receive -- thou -- thy good things in thy life, and Lazarus in like manner the evil things, and now he is comforted, and thou art distressed;
031626 and besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that they who are willing to go over from hence unto you are not able, nor do they from thence to us pass through.
031627 'And he said, I pray thee, then, father, that thou mayest send him to the house of my father,
031628 for I have five brothers, so that he may thoroughly testify to them, that they also may not come to this place of torment.
031629 'Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them;
031630 and he said, No, father Abraham, but if any one from the dead may go unto them, they will reform.
031631 And he said to him, If Moses and the prophets they do not hear, neither if one may rise out of the dead will they be persuaded.'
031701 And he said unto the disciples, 'It is impossible for the stumbling blocks not to come, but wo [to him] through whom they come;
031702 it is more profitable to him if a weighty millstone is put round about his neck, and he hath been cast into the sea, than that he may cause one of these little ones to stumble.
031703 'Take heed to yourselves, and, if thy brother may sin in regard to thee, rebuke him, and if he may reform, forgive him,
031704 and if seven times in the day he may sin against thee, and seven times in the day may turn back to thee, saying, I reform; thou shalt forgive him.'
031705 And the apostles said to the Lord, 'Add to us faith;'
031706 and the Lord said, 'If ye had faith as a grain of mustard, ye would have said to this sycamine, Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you.
031707 'But, who is he of you -- having a servant ploughing or feeding -- who, to him having come in out of the field, will say, Having come near, recline at meat?
031708 but will not [rather] say to him, Prepare what I may sup, and having girded thyself about, minister to me, till I eat and drink, and after these things thou shalt eat and drink?
031709 Hath he favour to that servant because he did the things directed? I think not.
031710 'So also ye, when ye may have done all the things directed you, say -- We are unprofitable servants, because that which we owed to do -- we have done.'
031711 And it came to pass, in his going on to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee,
031712 and he entering into a certain village, there met him ten leprous men, who stood afar off,
031713 and they lifted up the voice, saying, 'Jesus, master, deal kindly with us;'
031714 and having seen [them], he said to them, 'Having gone on, shew yourselves to the priests;' and it came to pass, in their going, they were cleansed,
031715 and one of them having seen that he was healed did turn back, with a loud voice glorifying God,
031716 and he fell upon [his] face at his feet, giving thanks to him, and he was a Samaritan.
031717 And Jesus answering said, 'Were not the ten cleansed, and the nine -- where?
031718 There were not found who did turn back to give glory to God, except this alien;'
031719 and he said to him, 'Having risen, be going on, thy faith hath saved thee.'
031720 And having been questioned by the Pharisees, when the reign of God doth come, he answered them, and said, 'The reign of God doth not come with observation;
031721 nor shall they say, Lo, here; or lo, there; for lo, the reign of God is within you.'
031722 And he said unto his disciples, 'Days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and ye shall not behold [it];
031723 and they shall say to you, Lo, here; or lo, there; ye may not go away, nor follow;
031724 for as the lightning that is lightening out of the one [part] under heaven, to the other part under heaven doth shine, so shall be also the Son of Man in his day;
031725 and first it behoveth him to suffer many things, and to be rejected by this generation.
031726 'And, as it came to pass in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man;
031727 they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were given in marriage, till the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the deluge came, and destroyed all;
031728 in like manner also, as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;
031729 and on the day Lot went forth from Sodom, He rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed all.
031730 'According to these things it shall be, in the day the Son of Man is revealed;
031731 in that day, he who shall be on the house top, and his vessels in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he in the field, in like manner, let him not turn backward;
031732 remember the wife of Lot.
031733 Whoever may seek to save his life, shall lose it; and whoever may lose it, shall preserve it.
031734 'I say to you, In that night, there shall be two men on one couch, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left;
031735 two women shall be grinding at the same place together, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left;
031736 two men shall be in the field, the one shall be taken, and the other left.'
031737 And they answering say to him, 'Where, sir?' and he said to them, 'Where the body [is], there will the eagles be gathered together.'
031801 And he spake also a simile to them, that it behoveth [us] always to pray, and not to faint,
031802 saying, 'A certain judge was in a certain city -- God he is not fearing, and man he is not regarding --
031803 and a widow was in that city, and she was coming unto him, saying, Do me justice on my opponent,
031804 and he would not for a time, but after these things he said in himself, Even if God I do not fear, and man do not regard,
031805 yet because this widow doth give me trouble, I will do her justice, lest, perpetually coming, she may plague me.'
031806 And the Lord said, 'Hear ye what the unrighteous judge saith:
031807 and shall not God execute the justice to His choice ones, who are crying unto Him day and night -- bearing long in regard to them?
031808 I say to you, that He will execute the justice to them quickly; but the Son of Man having come, shall he find the faith upon the earth?'
031809 And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in themselves that they were righteous, and have been despising the rest, this simile:
031810 'Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer;
031811 the Pharisee having stood by himself, thus prayed: God, I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer;
031812 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things -- as many as I possess.
031813 'And the tax-gatherer, having stood afar off, would not even the eyes lift up to the heaven, but was smiting on his breast, saying, God be propitious to me -- the sinner!
031814 I say to you, this one went down declared righteous, to his house, rather than that one: for every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.'
031815 And they were bringing near also the babes, that he may touch them, and the disciples having seen did rebuke them,
031816 and Jesus having called them near, said, 'Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the reign of God;
031817 verily I say to you, Whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child, may not enter into it.'
031818 And a certain ruler questioned him, saying, 'Good teacher, what having done -- shall I inherit life age-during?'
031819 And Jesus said to him, 'Why me dost thou call good? no one [is] good, except One -- God;
031820 the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal, Thou mayest not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.'
031821 And he said, 'All these I did keep from my youth;'
031822 and having heard these things, Jesus said to him, 'Yet one thing to thee is lacking; all things -- as many as thou hast -- sell, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, be following me;'
031823 and he, having heard these things, became very sorrowful, for he was exceeding rich.
031824 And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful, said, 'How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of God!
031825 for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to enter, than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter.'
031826 And those who heard, said, 'And who is able to be saved?'
031827 and he said, 'The things impossible with men are possible with God.'
031828 And Peter said, 'Lo, we left all, and did follow thee;'
031829 and he said to them, 'Verily I say to you, that there is not one who left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the reign of God,
031830 who may not receive back manifold more in this time, and in the coming age, life age-during.'
031831 And having taken the twelve aside, he said unto them, 'Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be completed -- that have been written through the prophets -- to the Son of Man,
031832 for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,
031833 and having scourged they shall put him to death, and on the third day he shall rise again.'
031834 And they none of these things understood, and this saying was hid from them, and they were not knowing the things said.
031835 And it came to pass, in his coming nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging,
031836 and having heard a multitude going by, he was inquiring what this may be,
031837 and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene doth pass by,
031838 and he cried out, saying, 'Jesus, Son of David, deal kindly with me;'
031839 and those going before were rebuking him, that he might be silent, but he was much more crying out, 'Son of David, deal kindly with me.'
031840 And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought unto him, and he having come nigh, he questioned him,
031841 saying, 'What wilt thou I shall do to thee?' and he said, 'Sir, that I may receive sight.'
031842 And Jesus said to him, 'Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee;'
031843 and presently he did receive sight, and was following him, glorifying God; and all the people, having seen, did give praise to God.
031901 And having entered, he was passing through Jericho,
031902 and lo, a man, by name called Zaccheus, and he was a chief tax-gatherer, and he was rich,
031903 and he was seeking to see Jesus, who he is, and was not able for the multitude, because in stature he was small,
031904 and having run forward before, he went up on a sycamore, that he may see him, because through that [way] he was about to pass by.
031905 And as Jesus came up to the place, having looked up, he saw him, and said unto him, 'Zaccheus, having hastened, come down, for to-day in thy house it behoveth me to remain;'
031906 and he having hastened did come down, and did receive him rejoicing;
031907 and having seen [it], they were all murmuring, saying -- 'With a sinful man he went in to lodge!'
031908 And Zaccheus having stood, said unto the Lord, 'Lo, the half of my goods, sir, I give to the poor, and if of any one anything I did take by false accusation, I give back fourfold.'
031909 And Jesus said unto him -- 'To-day salvation did come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham;
031910 for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.'
031911 And while they are hearing these things, having added he spake a simile, because of his being nigh to Jerusalem, and of their thinking that the reign of God is about presently to be made manifest.
031912 He said therefore, 'A certain man of birth went on to a far country, to take to himself a kingdom, and to return,
031913 and having called ten servants of his own, he gave to them ten pounds, and said unto them, Do business -- till I come;
031914 and his citizens were hating him, and did send an embassy after him, saying, We do not wish this one to reign over us.
031915 'And it came to pass, on his coming back, having taken the kingdom, that he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he gave the money, that he might know what any one had done in business.
031916 'And the first came near, saying, Sir, thy pound did gain ten pounds;
031917 and he said to him, Well done, good servant, because in a very little thou didst become faithful, be having authority over ten cities.
031918 'And the second came, saying, Sir, thy pound made five pounds;
031919 and he said also to this one, And thou, become thou over five cities.
031920 'And another came, saying, Sir, lo, thy pound, that I had lying away in a napkin;
031921 for I was afraid of thee, because thou art an austere man; thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.
031922 'And he saith to him, Out of thy mouth I will judge thee, evil servant: thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow!
031923 and wherefore didst thou not give my money to the bank, and I, having come, with interest might have received it?
031924 'And to those standing by he said, Take from him the pound, and give to him having the ten pounds --
031925 (and they said to him, Sir, he hath ten pounds) --
031926 for I say to you, that to every one having shall be given, and from him not having, also what he hath shall be taken from him,
031927 but those my enemies, who did not wish me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me.'
031928 And having said these things, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.
031929 And it came to pass, as he came nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, unto the mount called of the Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
031930 having said, Go away to the village over-against, in which, entering into, ye shall find a colt bound, on which no one of men did ever sit, having loosed it, bring [it];
031931 and if any one doth question you, Wherefore do ye loose [it]? thus ye shall say to him -- The Lord hath need of it.'
031932 And those sent, having gone away, found according as he said to them,
031933 and while they are loosing the colt, its owners said unto them, 'Why loose ye the colt?'
031934 and they said, 'The Lord hath need of it;'
031935 and they brought it unto Jesus, and having cast their garments upon the colt, they did set Jesus upon it.
031936 And as he is going, they were spreading their garments in the way,
031937 and as he is coming nigh now, at the descent of the mount of the Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a great voice for all the mighty works they had seen,
031938 saying, 'blessed [is] he who is coming, a king in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.'
031939 And certain of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, 'Teacher, rebuke thy disciples;'
031940 and he answering said to them, 'I say to you, that, if these shall be silent, the stones will cry out!'
031941 And when he came nigh, having seen the city, he wept over it,
031942 saying -- 'If thou didst know, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things for thy peace; but now they were hid from thine eyes.
031943 'Because days shall come upon thee, and thine enemies shall cast around thee a rampart, and compass thee round, and press thee on every side,
031944 and lay thee low, and thy children within thee, and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone, because thou didst not know the time of thy inspection.'
031945 And having entered into the temple, he began to cast forth those selling in it, and those buying,
031946 saying to them, 'It hath been written, My house is a house of prayer -- but ye made it a den of robbers.'
031947 And he was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him -- also the chiefs of the people --
031948 and they were not finding what they shall do, for all the people were hanging on him, hearing him.
032001 And it came to pass, on one of those days, as he is teaching the people in the temple, and proclaiming good news, the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came upon [him],
032002 and spake unto him, saying, 'Tell us by what authority thou dost these things? or who is he that gave to thee this authority?'
032003 And he answering said unto them, 'I will question you -- I also -- one thing, and tell me:
032004 the baptism of John, from heaven was it, or from men?'
032005 And they reasoned with themselves, saying -- 'If we may say, From heaven, he will say, Wherefore, then, did ye not believe him?
032006 and if we may say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are having been persuaded John to be a prophet.'
032007 And they answered, that they knew not whence [it was],
032008 and Jesus said to them, 'Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these things.'
032009 And he began to speak unto the people this simile: 'A certain man planted a vineyard, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went abroad for a long time,
032010 and at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that from the fruit of the vineyard they may give to him, but the husbandmen having beat him, did send [him] away empty.
032011 'And he added to send another servant, and they that one also having beaten and dishonoured, did send away empty;
032012 and he added to send a third, and this one also, having wounded, they did cast out.
032013 'And the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my son -- the beloved, perhaps having seen this one, they will do reverence;
032014 and having seen him, the husbandmen reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, we may kill him, that the inheritance may become ours;
032015 and having cast him outside of the vineyard, they killed [him]; what, then, shall the owner of the vineyard do to them?
032016 He will come, and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.' And having heard, they said, 'Let it not be!'
032017 and he, having looked upon them, said, 'What, then, is this that hath been written: A stone that the builders rejected -- this became head of a corner?
032018 every one who hath fallen on that stone shall be broken, and on whom it may fall, it will crush him to pieces.'
032019 And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him in that hour, and they feared the people, for they knew that against them he spake this simile.
032020 And, having watched [him], they sent forth liers in wait, feigning themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his word, to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor,
032021 and they questioned him, saying, 'Teacher, we have known that thou dost say and teach rightly, and dost not accept a person, but in truth the way of God dost teach;
032022 Is it lawful to us to give tribute to Caesar or not?'
032023 And he, having perceived their craftiness, said unto them, 'Why me do ye tempt?
032024 shew me a denary; of whom hath it an image and superscription?' and they answering said, 'Of Caesar:'
032025 and he said to them, 'Give back, therefore, the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;'
032026 and they were not able to take hold on his saying before the people, and having wondered at his answer, they were silent.
032027 And certain of the Sadducees, who are denying that there is a rising again, having come near, questioned him,
032028 saying, 'Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one's brother may die, having a wife, and he may die childless -- that his brother may take the wife, and may raise up seed to his brother.
032029 'There were, then, seven brothers, and the first having taken a wife, died childless,
032030 and the second took the wife, and he died childless,
032031 and the third took her, and in like manner also the seven -- they left not children, and they died;
032032 and last of all died also the woman:
032033 in the rising again, then, of which of them doth she become wife? -- for the seven had her as wife.'
032034 And Jesus answering said to them, 'The sons of this age do marry and are given in marriage,
032035 but those accounted worthy to obtain that age, and the rising again that is out of the dead, neither marry, nor are they given in marriage;
032036 for neither are they able to die any more -- for they are like messengers -- and they are sons of God, being sons of the rising again.
032037 'And that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the Bush, since he doth call the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;
032038 and He is not a God of dead men, but of living, for all live to Him.'
032039 And certain of the scribes answering said, 'Teacher, thou didst say well;'
032040 and no more durst they question him anything.
032041 And he said unto them, 'How do they say the Christ to be son of David,
032042 and David himself saith in the Book of Psalms, The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
032043 till I shall make thine enemies thy footstool;
032044 David, then, doth call him lord, and how is he his son?'
032045 And, all the people hearing, he said to his disciples,
032046 'Take heed of the scribes, who are wishing to walk in long robes, and are loving salutations in the markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in the suppers,
032047 who devour the houses of the widows, and for a pretence make long prayers, these shall receive more abundant judgment.'
032101 And having looked up, he saw those who did cast their gifts to the treasury -- rich men,
032102 and he saw also a certain poor widow casting there two mites,
032103 and he said, 'Truly I say to you, that this poor widow did cast in more than all;
032104 for all these out of their superabundance did cast into the gifts to God, but this one out of her want, all the living that she had, did cast in.'
032105 And certain saying about the temple, that with goodly stones and devoted things it hath been adorned, he said,
032106 'These things that ye behold -- days will come, in which there shall not be left a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.'
032107 And they questioned him, saying, 'Teacher, when, then, shall these things be? and what [is] the sign when these things may be about to happen?'
032108 And he said, 'See -- ye may not be led astray, for many shall come in my name, saying -- I am [he], and the time hath come nigh; go not on then after them;
032109 and when ye may hear of wars and uprisings, be not terrified, for it behoveth these things to happen first, but the end [is] not immediately.'
032110 Then said he to them, 'Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,
032111 great shakings also in every place, and famines, and pestilences, there shall be; fearful things also, and great signs from heaven there shall be;
032112 and before all these, they shall lay on you their hands, and persecute, delivering up to synagogues and prisons, being brought before kings and governors for my name's sake;
032113 and it shall become to you for a testimony.
032114 'Settle, then, to your hearts, not to meditate beforehand to reply,
032115 for I will give to you a mouth and wisdom that all your opposers shall not be able to refute or resist.
032116 'And ye shall be delivered up also by parents, and brothers, and kindred, and friends, and they shall put of you to death;
032117 and ye shall be hated by all because of my name --
032118 and a hair out of your head shall not perish;
032119 in your patience possess ye your souls.
032120 'And when ye may see Jerusalem surrounded by encampments, then know that come nigh did her desolation;
032121 then those in Judea, let them flee to the mountains; and those in her midst, let them depart out; and those in the countries, let them not come in to her;
032122 because these are days of vengeance, to fulfil all things that have been written.
032123 'And wo to those with child, and to those giving suck, in those days; for there shall be great distress on the land, and wrath on this people;
032124 and they shall fall by the mouth of the sword, and shall be led captive to all the nations, and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by nations, till the times of nations be fulfilled.
032125 'And there shall be signs in sun, and moon, and stars, and on the land [is] distress of nations with perplexity, sea and billow roaring;
032126 men fainting at heart from fear, and expectation of the things coming on the world, for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
032127 'And then they shall see the Son of Man, coming in a cloud, with power and much glory;
032128 and these things beginning to happen bend yourselves back, and lift up your heads, because your redemption doth draw nigh.'
032129 And he spake a simile to them: 'See the fig-tree, and all the trees,
032130 when they may now cast forth, having seen, of yourselves ye know that now is the summer nigh;
032131 so also ye, when ye may see these things happening, ye know that near is the reign of God;
032132 verily I say to you -- This generation may not pass away till all may have come to pass;
032133 the heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words may not pass away.
032134 'And take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts may be weighed down with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day may come on you,
032135 for as a snare it shall come on all those dwelling on the face of all the land,
032136 watch ye, then, in every season, praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are about to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.'
032137 And he was during the days in the temple teaching, and during the nights, going forth, he was lodging at the mount called of Olives;
032138 and all the people were coming early unto him in the temple to hear him.
032201 And the feast of the unleavened food was coming nigh, that is called Passover,
032202 and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they may take him up, for they were afraid of the people.
032203 And the Adversary entered into Judas, who is surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve,
032204 and he, having gone away, spake with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might deliver him up to them,
032205 and they rejoiced, and covenanted to give him money,
032206 and he agreed, and was seeking a favourable season to deliver him up to them without tumult.
032207 And the day of the unleavened food came, in which it was behoving the passover to be sacrificed,
032208 and he sent Peter and John, saying, 'Having gone on, prepare to us the passover, that we may eat;'
032209 and they said to him, 'Where wilt thou that we might prepare?'
032210 And he said to them, 'Lo, in your entering into the city, there shall meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of water, follow him to the house where he doth go in,
032211 and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where the passover with my disciples I may eat?
032212 and he shall show you a large upper room furnished, there make ready;'
032213 and they, having gone away, found as he hath said to them, and they made ready the passover.
032214 And when the hour come, he reclined (at meat), and the twelve apostles with him,
032215 and he said unto them, 'With desire I did desire to eat this passover with you before my suffering,
032216 for I say to you, that no more may I eat of it till it may be fulfilled in the reign of God.'
032217 And having taken a cup, having given thanks, he said, 'Take this and divide to yourselves,
032218 for I say to you that I may not drink of the produce of the vine till the reign of God may come.'
032219 And having taken bread, having given thanks, he brake and gave to them, saying, 'This is my body, that for you is being given, this do ye -- to remembrance of me.'
032220 In like manner, also, the cup after the supping, saying, 'This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, that for you is being poured forth.
032221 'But, lo, the hand of him delivering me up [is] with me on the table,
032222 and indeed the Son of Man doth go according to what hath been determined; but wo to that man through whom he is being delivered up.'
032223 And they began to reason among themselves, who then of them it may be, who is about to do this thing.
032224 And there happened also a strife among them -- who of them is accounted to be greater.
032225 And he said to them, 'The kings of the nations do exercise lordship over them, and those exercising authority upon them are called benefactors;
032226 but ye [are] not so, but he who is greater among you -- let him be as the younger; and he who is leading, as he who is ministering;
032227 for who is greater? he who is reclining (at meat), or he who is ministering? is it not he who is reclining (at meat)? and I -- I am in your midst as he who is ministering.
032228 'And ye -- ye are those who have remained with me in my temptations,
032229 and I appoint to you, as my Father did appoint to me, a kingdom,
032230 that ye may eat and may drink at my table, in my kingdom, and may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.'
032231 And the Lord said, 'Simon, Simon, lo, the Adversary did ask you for himself to sift as the wheat,
032232 and I besought for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and thou, when thou didst turn, strengthen thy brethren.'
032233 And he said to him, 'Sir, with thee I am ready both to prison and to death to go;'
032234 and he said, 'I say to thee, Peter, a cock shall not crow to-day, before thrice thou mayest disown knowing me.'
032235 And he said to them, 'When I sent you without bag, and scrip, and sandals, did ye lack anything?' and they said, 'Nothing.'
032236 Then said he to them, 'But, now, he who is having a bag, let him take [it] up, and in like manner also a scrip; and he who is not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword,
032237 for I say to you, that yet this that hath been written it behoveth to be fulfilled in me: And with lawless ones he was reckoned, for also the things concerning me have an end.'
032238 And they said, 'Sir, lo, here [are] two swords;' and he said to them, 'It is sufficient.'
032239 And having gone forth, he went on, according to custom, to the mount of the Olives, and his disciples also followed him,
032240 and having come to the place, he said to them, 'Pray ye not to enter into temptation.'
032241 And he was withdrawn from them, as it were a stone's cast, and having fallen on the knees he was praying,
032242 saying, 'Father, if Thou be counselling to make this cup pass from me --; but, not my will, but Thine be done.' --
032243 And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven strengthening him;
032244 and having been in agony, he was more earnestly praying, and his sweat became, as it were, great drops of blood falling upon the ground.
032245 And having risen up from the prayer, having come unto the disciples, he found them sleeping from the sorrow,
032246 and he said to them, 'Why do ye sleep? having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.'
032247 And while he is speaking, lo, a multitude, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them, and he came nigh to Jesus to kiss him,
032248 and Jesus said to him, 'Judas, with a kiss the Son of Man dost thou deliver up?'
032249 And those about him, having seen what was about to be, said to him, 'Sir, shall we smite with a sword?'
032250 And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief priest, and took off his right ear,
032251 and Jesus answering said, 'Suffer ye thus far,' and having touched his ear, he healed him.
032252 And Jesus said to those having come upon him -- chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders -- 'As upon a robber have ye come forth, with swords and sticks?
032253 while daily I was with you in the temple, ye did stretch forth no hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of the darkness.'
032254 And having taken him, they led and brought him to the house of the chief priest. And Peter was following afar off,
032255 and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter was sitting in the midst of them,
032256 and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light, and having earnestly looked at him, she said, 'And this one was with him!'
032257 and he disowned him, saying, 'Woman, I have not known him.'
032258 And after a little, another having seen him, said, 'And thou art of them!' and Peter said, 'Man, I am not.'
032259 And one hour, as it were, having intervened, a certain other was confidently affirming, saying, 'Of a truth this one also was with him, for he is also a Galilean;'
032260 and Peter said, 'Man, I have not known what thou sayest;' and presently, while he is speaking, a cock crew.
032261 And the Lord having turned did look on Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him -- 'Before a cock shall crow, thou mayest disown me thrice;'
032262 and Peter having gone without, wept bitterly.
032263 And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him, beating [him];
032264 and having blindfolded him, they were striking him on the face, and were questioning him, saying, 'Prophesy who he is who smote thee?'
032265 and many other things, speaking evilly, they spake in regard to him.
032266 And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people, chief priests also, and scribes, and they led him up to their own sanhedrim,
032267 saying, 'If thou be the Christ, tell us.' And he said to them, 'If I may tell you, ye will not believe;
032268 and if I also question [you], ye will not answer me or send me away;
032269 henceforth, there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God.'
032270 And they all said, 'Thou, then, art the Son of God?' and he said unto them, 'Ye say [it], because I am;'
032271 and they said, 'What need yet have we of testimony? for we ourselves did hear [it] from his mouth.'
032301 And having risen, the whole multitude of them did lead him to Pilate,
032302 and began to accuse him, saying, 'This one we found perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a king.'
032303 And Pilate questioned him, saying, 'Thou art the king of the Jews?' and he answering him, said, 'Thou dost say [it].'
032304 And Pilate said unto the chief priests, and the multitude, 'I find no fault in this man;'
032305 and they were the more urgent, saying -- 'He doth stir up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea -- having begun from Galilee -- unto this place.'
032306 And Pilate having heard of Galilee, questioned if the man is a Galilean,
032307 and having known that he is from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him back unto Herod, he being also in Jerusalem in those days.
032308 And Herod having seen Jesus did rejoice exceedingly, for he was wishing for a long [time] to see him, because of hearing many things about him, and he was hoping some sign to see done by him,
032309 and was questioning him in many words, and he answered him nothing.
032310 And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him,
032311 and Herod with his soldiers having set him at nought, and having mocked, having put around him gorgeous apparel, did send him back to Pilate,
032312 and both Pilate and Herod became friends on that day with one another, for they were before at enmity between themselves.
032313 And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,
032314 said unto them, 'Ye brought to me this man as perverting the people, and lo, I before you having examined, found in this man no fault in those things ye bring forward against him;
032315 no, nor yet Herod, for I sent you back unto him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is having been done by him;
032316 having chastised, therefore, I will release him,'
032317 for it was necessary for him to release to them one at every feast,
032318 and they cried out -- the whole multitude -- saying, 'Away with this one, and release to us Barabbas,'
032319 who had been, because of a certain sedition made in the city, and murder, cast into prison.
032320 Pilate again then -- wishing to release Jesus -- called to them,
032321 but they were calling out, saying, 'Crucify, crucify him.'
032322 And he a third time said unto them, 'Why, what evil did he? no cause of death did I find in him; having chastised him, then, I will release [him].'
032323 And they were pressing with loud voices asking him to be crucified, and their voices, and those of the chief priests, were prevailing,
032324 and Pilate gave judgment for their request being done,
032325 and he released him who because of sedition and murder hath been cast into the prison, whom they were asking, and Jesus he gave up to their will.
032326 And as they led him away, having taken hold on Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they put on him the cross, to bear [it] behind Jesus.
032327 And there was following him a great multitude of the people, and of women, who also were beating themselves and lamenting him,
032328 and Jesus having turned unto them, said, 'Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves weep ye, and for your children;
032329 for, lo, days do come, in which they shall say, Happy the barren, and wombs that did not bare, and paps that did not give suck;
032330 then they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us; --
032331 for, if in the green tree they do these things -- in the dry what may happen?'
032332 And there were also others -- two evil-doers -- with him, to be put to death;
032333 and when they came to the place that is called Skull, there they crucified him and the evil-doers, one on the right hand and one on the left.
032334 And Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they have not known what they do;' and parting his garments they cast a lot.
032335 And the people were standing, looking on, and the rulers also were sneering with them, saying, 'Others he saved, let him save himself, if this be the Christ, the choice one of God.'
032336 And mocking him also were the soldiers, coming near and offering vinegar to him,
032337 and saying, 'If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.'
032338 And there was also a superscription written over him, in letters of Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew, 'This is the King of the Jews.'
032339 And one of the evil-doers who were hanged, was speaking evil of him, saying, 'If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us.'
032340 And the other answering, was rebuking him, saying, 'Dost thou not even fear God, that thou art in the same judgment?
032341 and we indeed righteously, for things worthy of what we did we receive back, but this one did nothing out of place;'
032342 and he said to Jesus, 'Remember me, lord, when thou mayest come in thy reign;'
032343 and Jesus said to him, 'Verily I say to thee, To-day with me thou shalt be in the paradise.'
032344 And it was, as it were, the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land till the ninth hour,
032345 and the sun was darkened, and the vail of the sanctuary was rent in the midst,
032346 and having cried with a loud voice, Jesus said, 'Father, to Thy hands I commit my spirit;' and these things having said, he breathed forth the spirit.
032347 And the centurion having seen what was done, did glorify God, saying, 'Really this man was righteous;'
032348 and all the multitudes who were come together to this sight, beholding the things that came to pass, smiting their breasts did turn back;
032349 and all his acquaintances stood afar off, and women who did follow him from Galilee, beholding these things.
032350 And lo, a man, by name Joseph, being a counsellor, a man good and righteous,
032351 -- he was not consenting to their counsel and deed -- from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself was expecting the reign of God,
032352 he, having gone near to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus,
032353 and having taken it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn out, where no one was yet laid.
032354 And the day was a preparation, and sabbath was approaching,
032355 and the women also who have come with him out of Galilee having followed after, beheld the tomb, and how his body was placed,
032356 and having turned back, they made ready spices and ointments, and on the sabbath, indeed, they rested, according to the command.
032401 And on the first of the sabbaths, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bearing the spices they made ready, and certain [others] with them,
032402 and they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb,
032403 and having gone in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
032404 And it came to pass, while they are perplexed about this, that lo, two men stood by them in glittering apparel,
032405 and on their having become afraid, and having inclined the face to the earth, they said to them, 'Why do ye seek the living with the dead?
032406 he is not here, but was raised; remember how he spake to you, being yet in Galilee,
032407 saying -- It behoveth the Son of Man to be delivered up to the hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and the third day to rise again.'
032408 And they remembered his sayings,
032409 and having turned back from the tomb told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
032410 And it was the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women with them, who told unto the apostles these things,
032411 and their sayings appeared before them as idle talk, and they were not believing them.
032412 And Peter having risen, did run to the tomb, and having stooped down he seeth the linen clothes lying alone, and he went away to his own home, wondering at that which was come to pass.
032413 And, lo, two of them were going on during that day to a village, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, the name of which [is] Emmaus,
032414 and they were conversing with one another about all these things that have happened.
032415 And it came to pass in their conversing and reasoning together, that Jesus himself, having come nigh, was going on with them,
032416 and their eyes were holden so as not to know him,
032417 and he said unto them, 'What [are] these words that ye exchange with one another, walking, and ye are sad?'
032418 And the one, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said unto him, 'Art thou alone such a stranger in Jerusalem, that thou hast not known the things that came to pass in it in these days?'
032419 And he said to them, 'What things?' And they said to him, 'The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who became a man -- a prophet -- powerful in deed and word, before God and all the people,
032420 how also the chief priests and our rulers did deliver him up to a judgment of death, and crucified him;
032421 and we were hoping that he it is who is about to redeem Israel, and also with all these things, this third day is passing to-day, since these things happened.
032422 'And certain women of ours also astonished us, coming early to the tomb,
032423 and not having found his body, they came, saying also to have seen an apparition of messengers, who say he is alive,
032424 and certain of those with us went away unto the tomb, and found as even the women said, and him they saw not.'
032425 And he said unto them, 'O inconsiderate and slow in heart, to believe on all that the prophets spake!
032426 Was it not behoving the Christ these things to suffer, and to enter into his glory?'
032427 and having begun from Moses, and from all the prophets, he was expounding to them in all the Writings the things about himself.
032428 And they came nigh to the village whither they were going, and he made an appearance of going on further,
032429 and they constrained him, saying, 'Remain with us, for it is toward evening,' and the day did decline, and he went in to remain with them.
032430 And it came to pass, in his reclining (at meat) with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken, he was giving to them,
032431 and their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became unseen by them.
032432 And they said one to another, 'Was not our heart burning within us, as he was speaking to us in the way, and as he was opening up to us the Writings?'
032433 And they, having risen up the same hour, turned back to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven, and those with them,
032434 saying -- 'The Lord was raised indeed, and was seen by Simon;'
032435 and they were telling the things in the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread,
032436 and as they are speaking these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, 'Peace -- to you;'
032437 and being amazed, and becoming affrighted, they were thinking themselves to see a spirit.
032438 And he said to them, 'Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do reasonings come up in your hearts?
032439 see my hands and my feet, that I am he; handle me and see, because a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me having.'
032440 And having said this, he shewed to them the hands and the feet,
032441 and while they are not believing from the joy, and wondering, he said to them, 'Have ye anything here to eat?'
032442 and they gave to him part of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb,
032443 and having taken, he did eat before them,
032444 and he said to them, 'These [are] the words that I spake unto you, being yet with you, that it behoveth to be fulfilled all the things that are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, about me.'
032445 Then opened he up their understanding to understand the Writings,
032446 and he said to them -- 'Thus it hath been written, and thus it was behoving the Christ to suffer, and to rise out of the dead the third day,
032447 and reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem:
032448 and ye -- ye are witnesses of these things.
032449 'And, lo, I do send the promise of my Father upon you, but ye -- abide ye in the city of Jerusalem till ye be clothed with power from on high.'
032450 And he led them forth without -- unto Bethany, and having lifted up his hands he did bless them,
032451 and it came to pass, in his blessing them, he was parted from them, and was borne up to the heaven;
032452 and they, having bowed before him, did turn back to Jerusalem with great joy,
032453 and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
040101 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;
040102 this one was in the beginning with God;
040103 all things through him did happen, and without him happened not even one thing that hath happened.
040104 In him was life, and the life was the light of men,
040105 and the light in the darkness did shine, and the darkness did not perceive it.
040106 There came a man -- having been sent from God -- whose name [is] John,
040107 this one came for testimony, that he might testify about the Light, that all might believe through him;
040108 that one was not the Light, but -- that he might testify about the Light.
040109 He was the true Light, which doth enlighten every man, coming to the world;
040110 in the world he was, and the world through him was made, and the world did not know him:
040111 to his own things he came, and his own people did not receive him;
040112 but as many as did receive him to them he gave authority to become sons of God -- to those believing in his name,
040113 who -- not of blood nor of a will of flesh, nor of a will of man but -- of God were begotten.
040114 And the Word became flesh, and did tabernacle among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of an only begotten of a father, full of grace and truth.
040115 John doth testify concerning him, and hath cried, saying, 'This was he of whom I said, He who after me is coming, hath come before me, for he was before me;'
040116 and out of his fulness did we all receive, and grace over-against grace;
040117 for the law through Moses was given, the grace and the truth through Jesus Christ did come;
040118 God no one hath ever seen; the only begotten Son, who is on the bosom of the Father -- he did declare.
040119 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent out of Jerusalem priests and Levites, that they might question him, 'Who art thou?'
040120 and he confessed and did not deny, and confessed -- 'I am not the Christ.'
040121 And they questioned him, 'What then? Elijah art thou?' and he saith, 'I am not.' -- 'The prophet art thou?' and he answered, 'No.'
040122 They said then to him, 'Who art thou, that we may give an answer to those sending us? what dost thou say concerning thyself?'
040123 He said, 'I [am] a voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.'
040124 And those sent were of the Pharisees,
040125 and they questioned him and said to him, 'Why, then, dost thou baptize, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?'
040126 John answered them, saying, 'I baptize with water, but in midst of you he hath stood whom ye have not known, this one it is who is coming after me, who hath been before me,
040127 of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the cord of his sandal.'
040128 These things came to pass in Bethabara, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing,
040129 on the morrow John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, 'Lo, the Lamb of God, who is taking away the sin of the world;
040130 this is he concerning whom I said, After me doth come a man, who hath come before me, because he was before me:
040131 and I knew him not, but, that he might be manifested to Israel, because of this I came with the water baptizing.
040132 And John testified, saying -- 'I have seen the Spirit coming down, as a dove, out of heaven, and it remained on him;
040133 and I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, He said to me, On whomsoever thou mayst see the Spirit coming down, and remaining on him, this is he who is baptizing with the Holy Spirit;
040134 and I have seen, and have testified, that this is the Son of God.'
040135 On the morrow, again, John was standing, and two of his disciples,
040136 and having looked on Jesus walking, he saith, 'Lo, the Lamb of God;'
040137 and the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.
040138 And Jesus having turned, and having beheld them following, saith to them, 'What seek ye?' and they said to them, 'Rabbi, (which is, being interpreted, Teacher,) where remainest thou?'
040139 He saith to them, 'Come and see;' they came, and saw where he doth remain, and with him they remained that day and the hour was about the tenth.
040140 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard from John, and followed him;
040141 this one doth first find his own brother Simon, and saith to him, 'We have found the Messiah,' (which is, being interpreted, The Anointed,)
040142 and he brought him unto Jesus: and having looked upon him, Jesus saith, 'Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas, thou shalt be called Cephas,' (which is interpreted, A rock.)
040143 On the morrow, he willed to go forth to Galilee, and he findeth Philip, and saith to him, 'Be following me.'
040144 And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter;
040145 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, 'Him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and the prophets, we have found, Jesus the son of Joseph, who [is] from Nazareth;'
040146 and Nathanael said to him, 'Out of Nazareth is any good thing able to be?' Philip said to him, 'Come and see.'
040147 Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto him, and he saith concerning him, 'Lo, truly an Israelite, in whom guile is not;'
040148 Nathanael saith to him, 'Whence me dost thou know?' Jesus answered and said to him, 'Before Philip's calling thee -- thou being under the fig-tree -- I saw thee.'
040149 Nathanael answered and saith to him, 'Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the king of Israel.'
040150 Jesus answered and said to him, 'Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, thou dost believe; greater things than these thou shalt see;'
040151 and he saith to him, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the messengers of God going up and coming down upon the Son of Man.'
040201 And the third day a marriage happened in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,
040202 and also Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage;
040203 and wine having failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, 'Wine they have not;'
040204 Jesus saith to her, 'What -- to me and to thee, woman? not yet is mine hour come.'
040205 His mother saith to the ministrants, 'Whatever he may say to you -- do.'
040206 And there were there six water-jugs of stone, placed according to the purifying of the Jews, holding each two or three measures.
040207 Jesus saith to them, 'Fill the water-jugs with water;' and they filled them -- unto the brim;
040208 and he saith to them, 'Draw out, now, and bear to the director of the apartment;' and they bare.
040209 And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become wine, and knew not whence it is, (but the ministrants knew, who have drawn the water,) the director of the feast doth call the bridegroom,
040210 and saith to him, 'Every man, at first, the good wine doth set forth; and when they may have drunk freely, then the inferior; thou didst keep the good wine till now.'
040211 This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him;
040212 after this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they remained not many days.
040213 And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
040214 and he found in the temple those selling oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the money-changers sitting,
040215 and having made a whip of small cords, he put all forth out of the temple, also the sheep, and the oxen; and of the money-changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he overthrew,
040216 and to those selling the doves he said, 'Take these things hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.'
040217 And his disciples remembered that it is written, 'The zeal of Thy house did eat me up;'
040218 the Jews then answered and said to him, 'What sign dost thou shew to us -- that thou dost these things?'
040219 Jesus answered and said to them, 'Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up.'
040220 The Jews, therefore, said, 'Forty and six years was this sanctuary building, and wilt thou in three days raise it up?'
040221 but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body;
040222 when, then, he was raised out of the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this to them, and they believed the Writing, and the word that Jesus said.
040223 And as he was in Jerusalem, in the passover, in the feast, many believed in his name, beholding his signs that he was doing;
040224 and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them, because of his knowing all [men],
040225 and because he had no need that any should testify concerning man, for he himself was knowing what was in man.
040301 And there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus his name, a ruler of the Jews,
040302 this one came unto him by night, and said to him, 'Rabbi, we have known that from God thou hast come -- a teacher, for no one these signs is able to do that thou dost, if God may not be with him.'
040303 Jesus answered and said to him, 'Verily, verily, I say to thee, If any one may not be born from above, he is not able to see the reign of God;'
040304 Nicodemus saith unto him, 'How is a man able to be born, being old? is he able into the womb of his mother a second time to enter, and to be born?'
040305 Jesus answered, 'Verily, verily, I say to thee, If any one may not be born of water, and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the reign of God;
040306 that which hath been born of the flesh is flesh, and that which hath been born of the Spirit is spirit.
040307 'Thou mayest not wonder that I said to thee, It behoveth you to be born from above;
040308 the Spirit where he willeth doth blow, and his voice thou dost hear, but thou hast not known whence he cometh, and whither he goeth; thus is every one who hath been born of the Spirit.'
040309 Nicodemus answered and said to him, 'How are these things able to happen?'
040310 Jesus answered and said to him, 'Thou art the teacher of Israel -- and these things thou dost not know!
040311 'Verily, verily, I say to thee -- What we have known we speak, and what we have seen we testify, and our testimony ye do not receive;
040312 if the earthly things I said to you, and ye do not believe, how, if I shall say to you the heavenly things, will ye believe?
040313 and no one hath gone up to the heaven, except he who out of the heaven came down -- the Son of Man who is in the heaven.
040314 'And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness, so it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up,
040315 that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but may have life age-during,
040316 for God did so love the world, that His Son -- the only begotten -- He gave, that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but may have life age-during.
040317 For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him;
040318 he who is believing in him is not judged, but he who is not believing hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
040319 'And this is the judgment, that the light hath come to the world, and men did love the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil;
040320 for every one who is doing wicked things hateth the light, and doth not come unto the light, that his works may not be detected;
040321 but he who is doing the truth doth come to the light, that his works may be manifested, that in God they are having been wrought.'
040322 After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land of Judea, and there he did tarry with them, and was baptizing;
040323 and John was also baptizing in Aenon, nigh to Salem, because there were many waters there, and they were coming and were being baptized --
040324 for John was not yet cast into the prison --
040325 there arose then a question from the disciples of John with [some] Jews about purifying,
040326 and they came unto John, and said to him, 'Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou didst testify, lo, this one is baptizing, and all are coming unto him.'
040327 John answered and said, 'A man is not able to receive anything, if it may not have been given him from the heaven;
040328 ye yourselves do testify to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am having been sent before him;
040329 he who is having the bride is bridegroom, and the friend of the bridegroom, who is standing and hearing him, with joy doth rejoice because of the voice of the bridegroom; this, then, my joy hath been fulfilled.
040330 'Him it behoveth to increase, and me to become less;
040331 he who from above is coming is above all; he who is from the earth, from the earth he is, and from the earth he speaketh; he who from the heaven is coming is above all.
040332 'And what he hath seen and heard this he doth testify, and his testimony none receiveth;
040333 he who is receiving his testimony did seal that God is true;
040334 for he whom God sent, the sayings of God he speaketh; for not by measure doth God give the Spirit;
040335 the Father doth love the Son, and all things hath given into his hand;
040336 he who is believing in the Son, hath life age-during; and he who is not believing the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God doth remain upon him.'
040401 When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus more disciples doth make and baptize than John,
040402 (though indeed Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples,)
040403 he left Judea and went away again to Galilee,
040404 and it was behoving him to go through Samaria.
040405 He cometh, therefore, to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the place that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;
040406 and there was there a well of Jacob. Jesus therefore having been weary from the journeying, was sitting thus on the well; it was as it were the sixth hour;
040407 there cometh a woman out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her, 'Give me to drink;'
040408 for his disciples were gone away to the city, that they may buy victuals;
040409 the Samaritan woman therefore saith to him, 'How dost thou, being a Jew, ask drink from me, being a Samaritan woman?' for Jews have no dealing with Samaritans.
040410 Jesus answered and said to her, 'If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.'
040411 The woman saith to him, 'Sir, thou hast not even a vessel to draw with, and the well is deep; whence, then, hast thou the living water?
040412 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who did give us the well, and himself out of it did drink, and his sons, and his cattle?'
040413 Jesus answered and said to her, 'Every one who is drinking of this water shall thirst again;
040414 but whoever may drink of the water that I will give him, may not thirst -- to the age; and the water that I will give him shall become in him a well of water, springing up to life age-during.'
040415 The woman saith unto him, 'Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.'
040416 Jesus saith to her, 'Go, call thy husband, and come hither;'
040417 the woman answered and said, 'I have not a husband.' Jesus saith to her, 'Well didst thou say -- A husband I have not;
040418 for five husbands thou hast had, and, now, he whom thou hast is not thy husband; this hast thou said truly.'
040419 The woman saith to him, 'Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet;
040420 our fathers in this mountain did worship, and ye -- ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where it behoveth to worship.'
040421 Jesus saith to her, 'Woman, believe me, that there doth come an hour, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father;
040422 ye worship what ye have not known; we worship what we have known, because the salvation is of the Jews;
040423 but, there cometh an hour, and it now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father also doth seek such to worship him;
040424 God [is] a Spirit, and those worshipping Him, in spirit and truth it doth behove to worship.'
040425 The woman saith to him, 'I have known that Messiah doth come, who is called Christ, when that one may come, he will tell us all things;'
040426 Jesus saith to her, 'I am [he], who am speaking to thee.'
040427 And upon this came his disciples, and were wondering that with a woman he was speaking, no one, however, said, 'What seekest thou?' or 'Why speakest thou with her?'
040428 The woman then left her water-jug, and went away to the city, and saith to the men,
040429 'Come, see a man, who told me all things -- as many as I did; is this the Christ?'
040430 They went forth therefore out of the city, and were coming unto him.
040431 And in the meanwhile his disciples were asking him, saying, 'Rabbi, eat;'
040432 and he said to them, 'I have food to eat that ye have not known.'
040433 The disciples then said one to another, 'Did any one bring him anything to eat?'
040434 Jesus saith to them, 'My food is, that I may do the will of Him who sent me, and may finish His work;
040435 do not say that it is yet four months, and the harvest cometh; lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and see the fields, that they are white unto harvest already.
040436 'And he who is reaping doth receive a reward, and doth gather fruit to life age-during, that both he who is sowing and he who is reaping may rejoice together;
040437 for in this the saying is the true one, that one is the sower and another the reaper.
040438 I sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured; others laboured, and ye into their labour have entered.
040439 And from that city many believed in him, of the Samaritans, because of the word of the woman testifying, -- 'He told me all things -- as many as I did.'
040440 When, then, the Samaritans came unto him, they were asking him to remain with them, and he remained there two days;
040441 and many more did believe because of his word,
040442 and said to the woman -- 'No more because of thy speaking do we believe; for we ourselves have heard and known that this is truly the Saviour of the world -- the Christ.'
040443 And after the two days he went forth thence, and went away to Galilee,
040444 for Jesus himself testified that a prophet in his own country shall not have honour;
040445 when then, he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all things that he did in Jerusalem in the feast -- for they also went to the feast.
040446 Jesus came, therefore, again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine, and there was a certain courtier, whose son was ailing in Capernaum,
040447 he, having heard that Jesus is come out of Judea to Galilee, went away unto him, and was asking him that he may come down and may heal his son, for he was about to die.
040448 Jesus then said unto him, 'If signs and wonders ye may not see, ye will not believe.'
040449 The courtier saith unto him, 'Sir, come down before my child die;'
040450 Jesus saith to him, 'Be going on; thy son doth live.' And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and was going on,
040451 and he now going down, his servants met him, and told, saying -- 'Thy child doth live;'
040452 he inquired then of them the hour in which he became better, and they said to him -- 'Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him;'
040453 then the father knew that [it was] in that hour in which Jesus said to him -- 'Thy son doth live,' and he himself believed, and his whole house;
040454 this again a second sign did Jesus, having come out of Judea to Galilee.
040501 After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
040502 and there is in Jerusalem by the sheep-[gate] a pool that is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches,
040503 in these were lying a great multitude of the ailing, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water,
040504 for a messenger at a set time was going down in the pool, and was troubling the water, the first then having gone in after the troubling of the water, became whole of whatever sickness he was held.
040505 and there was a certain man there being in ailment thirty and eight years,
040506 him Jesus having seen lying, and having known that he is already a long time, he saith to him, 'Dost thou wish to become whole?'
040507 The ailing man answered him, 'Sir, I have no man, that, when the water may be troubled, he may put me into the pool, and while I am coming, another doth go down before me.'
040508 Jesus saith to him, 'Rise, take up thy couch, and be walking;'
040509 and immediately the man became whole, and he took up his couch, and was walking, and it was a sabbath on that day,
040510 the Jews then said to him that hath been healed, 'It is a sabbath; it is not lawful to thee to take up the couch.'
040511 He answered them, 'He who made me whole -- that one said to me, Take up thy couch, and be walking;'
040512 they questioned him, then, 'Who is the man who is saying to thee, Take up thy couch and be walking?'
040513 But he that was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus did move away, a multitude being in the place.
040514 After these things, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, 'Lo, thou hast become whole; sin no more, lest something worse may happen to thee.'
040515 The man went away, and told the Jews that it is Jesus who made him whole,
040516 and because of this were the Jews persecuting Jesus, and seeking to kill him, because these things he was doing on a sabbath.
040517 And Jesus answered them, 'My Father till now doth work, and I work;'
040518 because of this, then, were the Jews seeking the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the sabbath, but he also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.
040519 Jesus therefore responded and said to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything of himself, if he may not see the Father doing anything; for whatever things He may do, these also the Son in like manner doth;
040520 for the Father doth love the Son, and doth shew to him all things that He himself doth; and greater works than these He will shew him, that ye may wonder.
040521 'For, as the Father doth raise the dead, and doth make alive, so also the Son doth make alive whom he willeth;
040522 for neither doth the Father judge any one, but all the judgment He hath given to the Son,
040523 that all may honour the Son according as they honour the Father; he who is not honouring the Son, doth not honour the Father who sent him.
040524 'Verily, verily, I say to you -- He who is hearing my word, and is believing Him who sent me, hath life age-during, and to judgment he doth not come, but hath passed out of the death to the life.
040525 'Verily, verily, I say to you -- There cometh an hour, and it now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those having heard shall live;
040526 for, as the Father hath life in himself, so He gave also to the Son to have life in himself,
040527 and authority He gave him also to do judgment, because he is Son of Man.
040528 'Wonder not at this, because there doth come an hour in which all those in the tombs shall hear his voice,
040529 and they shall come forth; those who did the good things to a rising again of life, and those who practised the evil things to a rising again of judgment.
040530 'I am not able of myself to do anything; according as I hear I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.
040531 'If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true;
040532 another there is who is testifying concerning me, and I have known that the testimony that he doth testify concerning me is true;
040533 ye have sent unto John, and he hath testified to the truth.
040534 'But I do not receive testimony from man, but these things I say that ye may be saved;
040535 he was the burning and shining lamp, and ye did will to be glad, for an hour, in his light.
040536 'But I have the testimony greater than John's, for the works that the Father gave me, that I might finish them, the works themselves that I do, they testify concerning me, that the Father hath sent me.
040537 'And the Father who sent me Himself hath testified concerning me; ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor His appearance have ye seen;
040538 and His word ye have not remaining in you, because whom He sent, him ye do not believe.
040539 'Ye search the Writings, because ye think in them to have life age-during, and these are they that are testifying concerning me;
040540 and ye do not will to come unto me, that ye may have life;
040541 glory from man I do not receive,
040542 but I have known you, that the love of God ye have not in yourselves.
040543 'I have come in the name of my Father, and ye do not receive me; if another may come in his own name, him ye will receive;
040544 how are ye able -- ye -- to believe, glory from one another receiving, and the glory that [is] from God alone ye seek not?
040545 'Do not think that I will accuse you unto the Father; there is who is accusing you, Moses -- in whom ye have hoped;
040546 for if ye were believing Moses, ye would have been believing me, for he wrote concerning me;
040547 but if his writings ye believe not, how shall ye believe my sayings?'
040601 After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee (of Tiberias),
040602 and there was following him a great multitude, because they were seeing his signs that he was doing on the ailing;
040603 and Jesus went up to the mount, and he was there sitting with his disciples,
040604 and the passover was nigh, the feast of the Jews.
040605 Jesus then having lifted up [his] eyes and having seen that a great multitude doth come to him, saith unto Philip, 'Whence shall we buy loaves, that these may eat?' --
040606 and this he said, trying him, for he himself had known what he was about to do.
040607 Philip answered him, 'Two hundred denaries' worth of loaves are not sufficient to them, that each of them may receive some little;'
040608 one of his disciples -- Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter -- saith to him,
040609 'There is one little lad here who hath five barley loaves, and two fishes, but these -- what are they to so many?'
040610 And Jesus said, 'Make the men to sit down;' and there was much grass in the place, the men then sat down, in number, as it were, five thousand,
040611 and Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those reclining, in like manner, also of the little fishes as much as they wished.
040612 And when they were filled, he saith to his disciples, 'Gather together the broken pieces that are over, that nothing may be lost;'
040613 they gathered together, therefore, and filled twelve hand-baskets with broken pieces, from the five barley loaves that were over to those having eaten.
040614 The men, then, having seen the sign that Jesus did, said -- 'This is truly the Prophet, who is coming to the world;'
040615 Jesus, therefore, having known that they are about to come, and to take him by force that they may make him king, retired again to the mountain himself alone.
040616 And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
040617 and having entered into the boat, they were going over the sea to Capernaum, and darkness had already come, and Jesus had not come unto them,
040618 the sea also -- a great wind blowing -- was being raised,
040619 having pushed onwards, therefore, about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and coming nigh to the boat, and they were afraid;
040620 and he saith to them, 'I am [he], be not afraid;'
040621 they were willing then to receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat came unto the land to which they were going.
040622 On the morrow, the multitude that was standing on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other little boat there except one -- that into which his disciples entered -- and that Jesus went not in with his disciples into the little boat, but his disciples went away alone,
040623 (and other little boats came from Tiberias, nigh the place where they did eat the bread, the Lord having given thanks),
040624 when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they also themselves did enter into the boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus;
040625 and having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, 'Rabbi, when hast thou come hither?'
040626 Jesus answered them and said, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were satisfied;
040627 work not for the food that is perishing, but for the food that is remaining to life age-during, which the Son of Man will give to you, for him did the Father seal -- [even] God.'
040628 They said therefore unto him, 'What may we do that we may work the works of God?'
040629 Jesus answered and said to them, 'This is the work of God, that ye may believe in him whom He did send.'
040630 They said therefore to him, 'What sign, then, dost thou, that we may see and may believe thee? what dost thou work?
040631 our fathers the manna did eat in the wilderness, according as it is having been written, Bread out of the heaven He gave them to eat.'
040632 Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread out of the heaven; but my Father doth give you the true bread out of the heaven;
040633 for the bread of God is that which is coming down out of the heaven, and giving life to the world.'
040634 They said, therefore, unto him, 'Sir, always give us this bread.'
040635 And Jesus said to them, 'I am the bread of the life; he who is coming unto me may not hunger, and he who is believing in me may not thirst -- at any time;
040636 but I said to you, that ye also have seen me, and ye believe not;
040637 all that the Father doth give to me will come unto me; and him who is coming unto me, I may in no wise cast without,
040638 because I have come down out of the heaven, not that I may do my will, but the will of Him who sent me.
040639 'And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that all that He hath given to me I may not lose of it, but may raise it up in the last day;
040640 and this is the will of Him who sent me, that every one who is beholding the Son, and is believing in him, may have life age-during, and I will raise him up in the last day.'
040641 The Jews, therefore, were murmuring at him, because he said, 'I am the bread that came down out of the heaven;'
040642 and they said, 'Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we have known? how then saith this one -- Out of the heaven I have come down?'
040643 Jesus answered, therefore, and said to them, 'Murmur not one with another;
040644 no one is able to come unto me, if the Father who sent me may not draw him, and I will raise him up in the last day;
040645 it is having been written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God; every one therefore who heard from the Father, and learned, cometh to me;
040646 not that any one hath seen the Father, except he who is from God, he hath seen the Father.
040647 'Verily, verily, I say to you, He who is believing in me, hath life age-during;
040648 I am the bread of the life;
040649 your fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness, and they died;
040650 this is the bread that out of the heaven is coming down, that any one may eat of it, and not die.
040651 'I am the living bread that came down out of the heaven; if any one may eat of this bread he shall live -- to the age; and the bread also that I will give is my flesh, that I will give for the life of the world.'
040652 The Jews, therefore, were striving with one another, saying, 'How is this one able to give us [his] flesh to eat?'
040653 Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, If ye may not eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and may not drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves;
040654 he who is eating my flesh, and is drinking my blood, hath life age-during, and I will raise him up in the last day;
040655 for my flesh truly is food, and my blood truly is drink;
040656 he who is eating my flesh, and is drinking my blood, doth remain in me, and I in him.
040657 'According as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, he also who is eating me, even that one shall live because of me;
040658 this is the bread that came down out of the heaven; not as your fathers did eat the manna, and died; he who is eating this bread shall live -- to the age.'
040659 These things he said in a synagogue, teaching in Capernaum;
040660 many, therefore, of his disciples having heard, said, 'This word is hard; who is able to hear it?'
040661 And Jesus having known in himself that his disciples are murmuring about this, said to them, 'Doth this stumble you?
040662 if then ye may behold the Son of Man going up where he was before?
040663 the spirit it is that is giving life; the flesh doth not profit anything; the sayings that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life;
040664 but there are certain of you who do not believe;' for Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who are not believing, and who is he who will deliver him up,
040665 and he said, 'Because of this I have said to you -- No one is able to come unto me, if it may not have been given him from my Father.'
040666 From this [time] many of his disciples went away backward, and were no more walking with him,
040667 Jesus, therefore, said to the twelve, 'Do ye also wish to go away?'
040668 Simon Peter, therefore, answered him, 'Sir, unto whom shall we go? thou hast sayings of life age-during;
040669 and we have believed, and we have known, that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.'
040670 Jesus answered them, 'Did not I choose you -- the twelve? and of you -- one is a devil.
040671 And he spake of Judas, Simon's [son], Iscariot, for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.
040701 And Jesus was walking after these things in Galilee, for he did not wish to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him,
040702 and the feast of the Jews was nigh -- that of tabernacles --
040703 his brethren, therefore, said unto him, 'Remove hence, and go away to Judea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works that thou dost;
040704 for no one in secret doth anything, and himself seeketh to be in public; if thou dost these things -- manifest thyself to the world;'
040705 for not even were his brethren believing in him.
040706 Jesus, therefore, saith to them, 'My time is not yet present, but your time is always ready;
040707 the world is not able to hate you, but me it doth hate, because I testify concerning it that its works are evil.
040708 Ye -- go ye up to this feast; I do not yet go up to this feast, because my time hath not yet been fulfilled;'
040709 and saying these things to them, he remained in Galilee.
040710 And when his brethren went up, then also he himself went up to the feast, not manifestly, but as in secret;
040711 the Jews, therefore, were seeking him, in the feast, and said, 'Where is that one?'
040712 and there was much murmuring about him among the multitudes, some indeed said -- 'He is good;' and others said, 'No, but he leadeth astray the multitude;'
040713 no one, however, was speaking freely about him, through fear of the Jews.
040714 And it being now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up to the temple, and he was teaching,
040715 and the Jews were wondering, saying, 'How hath this one known letters -- not having learned?'
040716 Jesus answered them and said, 'My teaching is not mine, but His who sent me;
040717 if any one may will to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or -- I do speak from myself.
040718 'He who is speaking from himself his own glory doth seek, but he who is seeking the glory of him who sent him, this one is true, and unrighteousness is not in him;
040719 hath not Moses given you the law? and none of you doth the law; why me do ye seek to kill?'
040720 The multitude answered and said, 'Thou hast a demon, who doth seek to kill thee?'
040721 Jesus answered and said to them, 'One work I did, and ye all wonder,
040722 because of this, Moses hath given you the circumcision -- not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers -- and on a sabbath ye circumcise a man;
040723 if a man doth receive circumcision on a sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken, are ye wroth with me that I made a man all whole on a sabbath?
040724 judge not according to appearance, but the righteous judgment judge.'
040725 Certain, therefore, of the Jerusalemites said, 'Is not this he whom they are seeking to kill?
040726 and, lo, he doth speak freely, and they say nothing to him; did the rulers at all know truly that this is truly the Christ?
040727 but this one -- we have known whence he is; and the Christ, when he doth come, no one doth know whence he is.'
040728 Jesus cried, therefore, in the temple, teaching and saying, 'Ye have both known me, and ye have known whence I am; and I have not come of myself, but He who sent me is true, whom ye have not known;
040729 and I have known Him, because I am from Him, and He did send me.'
040730 They were seeking, therefore, to seize him, and no one laid the hand on him, because his hour had not yet come,
040731 and many out of the multitude did believe in him, and said -- 'The Christ -- when he may come -- will he do more signs than these that this one did?'
040732 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers that they may take him;
040733 Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Yet a little time I am with you, and I go away unto Him who sent me;
040734 ye will seek me, and ye shall not find; and where I am, ye are not able to come.'
040735 The Jews, therefore, said among themselves, 'Whither is this one about to go that we shall not find him? -- to the dispersion of the Greeks is he about to go? and to teach the Greeks;
040736 what is this word that he said, Ye will seek me, and ye shall not find? and, Where I am, ye are not able to come?'
040737 And in the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, 'If any one doth thirst, let him come unto me and drink;
040738 he who is believing in me, according as the Writing said, Rivers out of his belly shall flow of living water;'
040739 and this he said of the Spirit, which those believing in him were about to receive; for not yet was the Holy Spirit, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
040740 Many, therefore out of the multitude, having heard the word, said, 'This is truly the Prophet;'
040741 others said, 'This is the Christ;' and others said, 'Why, out of Galilee doth the Christ come?
040742 Did not the Writing say, that out of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem -- the village where David was -- the Christ doth come?'
040743 A division, therefore, arose among the multitude because of him.
040744 And certain of them were willing to seize him, but no one laid hands on him;
040745 the officers came, therefore, unto the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, 'Wherefore did ye not bring him?'
040746 The officers answered, 'Never so spake man -- as this man.'
040747 The Pharisees, therefore, answered them, 'Have ye also been led astray?
040748 did any one out of the rulers believe in him? or out of the Pharisees?
040749 but this multitude, that is not knowing the law, is accursed.'
040750 Nicodemus saith unto them -- he who came by night unto him -- being one of them,
040751 'Doth our law judge the man, if it may not hear from him first, and know what he doth?'
040752 They answered and said to him, 'Art thou also out of Galilee? search and see, that a prophet out of Galilee hath not risen;'
040753 and each one went on to his house, but Jesus went on to the mount of the Olives.
040801 And at dawn he came again to the temple,
040802 and all the people were coming unto him, and having sat down, he was teaching them;
040803 and the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman having been taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst,
040804 they say to him, 'Teacher, this woman was taken in the very crime -- committing adultery,
040805 and in the law, Moses did command us that such be stoned; thou, therefore, what dost thou say?'
040806 and this they said, trying him, that they might have to accuse him. And Jesus, having stooped down, with the finger he was writing on the ground,
040807 and when they continued asking him, having bent himself back, he said unto them, 'The sinless of you -- let him first cast the stone at her;'
040808 and again having stooped down, he was writing on the ground,
040809 and they having heard, and by the conscience being convicted, were going forth one by one, having begun from the elders -- unto the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
040810 And Jesus having bent himself back, and having seen no one but the woman, said to her, 'Woman, where are those -- thine accusers? did no one pass sentence upon thee?'
040811 and she said, 'No one, Sir;' and Jesus said to her, 'Neither do I pass sentence on thee; be going on, and no more sin.'
040812 Again, therefore, Jesus spake to them, saying, 'I am the light of the world; he who is following me shall not walk in the darkness, but he shall have the light of the life.'
040813 The Pharisees, therefore, said to him, 'Thou of thyself dost testify, thy testimony is not true;'
040814 Jesus answered and said to them, 'And if I testify of myself -- my testimony is true, because I have known whence I came, and whither I go, and ye -- ye have not known whence I come, or whither I go.
040815 'Ye according to the flesh do judge; I do not judge any one,
040816 and even if I do judge my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me;
040817 and also in your law it hath been written, that the testimony of two men are true;
040818 I am [one] who is testifying of myself, and the Father who sent me doth testify of me.'
040819 They said, therefore, to him, 'Where is thy father?' Jesus answered, 'Ye have neither known me nor my Father: if me ye had known, my Father also ye had known.'
040820 These sayings spake Jesus in the treasury, teaching in the temple, and no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come;
040821 therefore said Jesus again to them, 'I go away, and ye will seek me, and in your sin ye shall die; whither I go away, ye are not able to come.'
040822 The Jews, therefore, said, 'Will he kill himself, because he saith, Whither I go away, ye are not able to come?'
040823 and he said to them, 'Ye are from beneath, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world;
040824 I said, therefore, to you, that ye shall die in your sins, for if ye may not believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.'
040825 They said, therefore, to him, 'Thou -- who art thou?' and Jesus said to them, 'Even what I did speak of to you at the beginning;
040826 many things I have to speak concerning you and to judge, but He who sent me is true, and I -- what things I heard from Him -- these I say to the world.'
040827 They knew not that of the Father he spake to them;
040828 Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'When ye may lift up the Son of Man then ye will know that I am [he]; and of myself I do nothing, but according as my Father did teach me, these things I speak;
040829 and He who sent me is with me; the Father did not leave me alone, because I, the things pleasing to Him, do always.'
040830 As he is speaking these things, many believed in him;
040831 Jesus, therefore, said unto the Jews who believed in him, 'If ye may remain in my word, truly my disciples ye are, and ye shall know the truth,
040832 and the truth shall make you free.'
040833 They answered him, 'Seed of Abraham we are; and to no one have we been servants at any time; how dost thou say -- Ye shall become free?'
040834 Jesus answered them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you -- Every one who is committing sin, is a servant of the sin,
040835 and the servant doth not remain in the house -- to the age, the son doth remain -- to the age;
040836 if then the son may make you free, in reality ye shall be free.
040837 'I have known that ye are seed of Abraham, but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you;
040838 I -- that which I have seen with my Father do speak, and ye, therefore, that which ye have seen with your father -- ye do.'
040839 They answered and said to him, 'Our father is Abraham;' Jesus saith to them, 'If children of Abraham ye were, the works of Abraham ye were doing;
040840 and now, ye seek to kill me -- a man who hath spoken to you the truth I heard from God; this Abraham did not;
040841 ye do the works of your father.' They said, therefore, to him, 'We of whoredom have not been born; one Father we have -- God;'
040842 Jesus then said to them, 'If God were your father, ye were loving me, for I came forth from God, and am come; for neither have I come of myself, but He sent me;
040843 wherefore do ye not know my speech? because ye are not able to hear my word.
040844 'Ye are of a father -- the devil, and the desires of your father ye will to do; he was a man-slayer from the beginning, and in the truth he hath not stood, because there is no truth in him; when one may speak the falsehood, of his own he speaketh, because he is a liar -- also his father.
040845 'And because I say the truth, ye do not believe me.
040846 Who of you doth convict me of sin? and if I speak truth, wherefore do ye not believe me?
040847 he who is of God, the sayings of God he doth hear; because of this ye do not hear, because of God ye are not.'
040848 The Jews, therefore, answered and said to him, 'Do we not say well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?'
040849 Jesus answered, 'I have not a demon, but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me;
040850 and I do not seek my own glory; there is who is seeking and is judging;
040851 verily, verily, I say to you, If any one may keep my word, death he may not see -- to the age.'
040852 The Jews, therefore, said to him, 'Now we have known that thou hast a demon; Abraham did die, and the prophets, and thou dost say, If any one may keep my word, he shall not taste of death -- to the age!
040853 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died; whom dost thou make thyself?'
040854 Jesus answered, 'If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who is glorifying me, of whom ye say that He is your God;
040855 and ye have not known Him, and I have known Him, and if I say that I have not known Him, I shall be like you -- speaking falsely; but I have known Him, and His word I keep;
040856 Abraham, your father, was glad that he might see my day; and he saw, and did rejoice.'
040857 The Jews, therefore, said unto him, 'Thou art not yet fifty years old, and Abraham hast thou seen?'
040858 Jesus said to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham's coming -- I am;'
040859 they took up, therefore, stones that they may cast at him, but Jesus hid himself, and went forth out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
040901 And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth,
040902 and his disciples asked him, saying, 'Rabbi, who did sin, this one or his parents, that he should be born blind?'
040903 Jesus answered, 'Neither did this one sin nor his parents, but that the works of God may be manifested in him;
040904 it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me while it is day; night doth come, when no one is able to work: --
040905 when I am in the world, I am a light of the world.'
040906 These things saying, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man, and said to him,
040907 'Go away, wash at the pool of Siloam,' which is, interpreted, Sent. He went away, therefore, and did wash, and came seeing;
040908 the neighbours, therefore, and those seeing him before, that he was blind, said, 'Is not this he who is sitting and begging?'
040909 others said -- 'This is he;' and others -- 'He is like to him;' he himself said, -- 'I am [he].'
040910 They said, therefore, to him, 'How were thine eyes opened?'
040911 he answered and said, 'A man called Jesus made clay, and rubbed my eyes, and said to me, Go away to the pool of Siloam, and wash; and having gone away and having washed, I received sight;'
040912 they said, therefore, to him, 'Where is that one?' he saith, 'I have not known.'
040913 They bring him to the Pharisees who once [was] blind,
040914 and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
040915 Again, therefore, the Pharisees also were asking him how he received sight, and he said to them, 'Clay he did put upon my eyes, and I did wash -- and I see.'
040916 Of the Pharisees, therefore, certain said, 'This man is not from God, because the sabbath he doth not keep;' others said, 'How is a man -- a sinful one -- able to do such signs?' and there was a division among them.
040917 They said to the blind man again, 'Thou -- what dost thou say of him -- that he opened thine eyes?'
040918 and he said -- 'He is a prophet.' The Jews, therefore, did not believe concerning him that he was blind and did receive sight, till that they called the parents of him who received sight,
040919 and they asked them, saying, 'Is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind? how then now doth he see?'
040920 His parents answered them and said, 'We have known that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
040921 and how he now seeth, we have not known; or who opened his eyes, we have not known; himself is of age, ask him; he himself shall speak concerning himself.'
040922 These things said his parents, because they were afraid of the Jews, for already had the Jews agreed together, that if any one may confess him -- Christ, he may be put out of the synagogue;
040923 because of this his parents said -- 'He is of age, ask him.'
040924 They called, therefore, a second time the man who was blind, and they said to him, 'Give glory to God, we have known that this man is a sinner;'
040925 he answered, therefore, and said, 'If he be a sinner -- I have not known, one thing I have known, that, being blind, now I see.'
040926 And they said to him again, 'What did he to thee? how did he open thine eyes?'
040927 He answered them, 'I told you already, and ye did not hear; why again do ye wish to hear? do ye also wish to become his disciples?'
040928 They reviled him, therefore, and said, 'Thou art his disciple, and we are Moses' disciples;
040929 we have known that God hath spoken to Moses, but this one -- we have not known whence he is.'
040930 The man answered and said to them, 'Why, in this is a wonderful thing, that ye have not known whence he is, and he opened my eyes!
040931 and we have known that God doth not hear sinners, but, if any one may be a worshipper of God, and may do His will, him He doth hear;
040932 from the age it was not heard, that any one did open eyes of one who hath been born blind;
040933 if this one were not from God, he were not able to do anything.'
040934 They answered and said to him, 'In sins thou wast born altogether, and thou dost teach us!' and they cast him forth without.
040935 Jesus heard that they cast him forth without, and having found him, he said to him, 'Dost thou believe in the Son of God?'
040936 he answered and said, 'Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?'
040937 And Jesus said to him, 'Thou hast both seen him, and he who is speaking with thee is he;'
040938 and he said, 'I believe, sir,' and bowed before him.
040939 And Jesus said, 'For judgment I to this world did come, that those not seeing may see, and those seeing may become blind.'
040940 And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, 'Are we also blind?'
040941 Jesus said to them, 'If ye were blind, ye were not having had sin, but now ye say -- We see, therefore doth your sin remain.
041001 'Verily, verily, I say to you, He who is not entering through the door to the fold of the sheep, but is going up from another side, that one is a thief and a robber;
041002 and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep;
041003 to this one the doorkeeper doth open, and the sheep hear his voice, and his own sheep he doth call by name, and doth lead them forth;
041004 and when his own sheep he may put forth, before them he goeth on, and the sheep follow him, because they have known his voice;
041005 and a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, because they have not known the voice of strangers.'
041006 This similitude spake Jesus to them, and they knew not what the things were that he was speaking to them;
041007 Jesus said therefore again to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you -- I am the door of the sheep;
041008 all, as many as came before me, are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them;
041009 I am the door, through me if any one may come in, he shall be saved, and he shall come in, and go out, and find pasture.
041010 'The thief doth not come, except that he may steal, and kill, and destroy; I came that they may have life, and may have [it] abundantly.
041011 'I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd his life layeth down for the sheep;
041012 and the hireling, and not being a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, doth behold the wolf coming, and doth leave the sheep, and doth flee; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep;
041013 and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling, and is not caring for the sheep.
041014 'I am the good shepherd, and I know my [sheep], and am known by mine,
041015 according as the Father doth know me, and I know the Father, and my life I lay down for the sheep,
041016 and other sheep I have that are not of this fold, these also it behoveth me to bring, and my voice they will hear, and there shall become one flock -- one shepherd.
041017 'Because of this doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that again I may take it;
041018 no one doth take it from me, but I lay it down of myself; authority I have to lay it down, and authority I have again to take it; this command I received from my Father.'
041019 Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews, because of these words,
041020 and many of them said, 'He hath a demon, and is mad, why do ye hear him?'
041021 others said, 'These sayings are not those of a demoniac; is a demon able blind men's eyes to open?'
041022 And the dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter,
041023 and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon,
041024 the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to him, 'Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense? if thou art the Christ, tell us freely.'
041025 Jesus answered them, 'I told you, and ye do not believe; the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me;
041026 but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep,
041027 according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and I know them, and they follow me,
041028 and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not perish -- to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand;
041029 my Father, who hath given to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father;
041030 I and the Father are one.'
041031 Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they may stone him;
041032 Jesus answered them, 'Many good works did I shew you from my Father; because of which work of them do ye stone me?'
041033 The Jews answered him, saying, 'For a good work we do not stone thee, but for evil speaking, and because thou, being a man, dost make thyself God.'
041034 Jesus answered them, 'Is it not having been written in your law: I said, ye are gods?
041035 if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came, (and the Writing is not able to be broken,)
041036 of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the world, do ye say -- Thou speakest evil, because I said, Son of God I am?
041037 if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;
041038 and if I do, even if me ye may not believe, the works believe, that ye may know and may believe that in me [is] the Father, and I in Him.'
041039 Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he went forth out of their hand,
041040 and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained there,
041041 and many came unto him, and said -- 'John, indeed, did no sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were true;'
041042 and many did believe in him there.
041101 And there was a certain one ailing, Lazarus, from Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister --
041102 and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment, and did wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ailing --
041103 therefore sent the sisters unto him, saying, 'Sir, lo, he whom thou dost love is ailing;'
041104 and Jesus having heard, said, 'This ailment is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.'
041105 And Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,
041106 when, therefore, he heard that he is ailing, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days,
041107 then after this, he saith to the disciples, 'We may go to Judea again;'
041108 the disciples say to him, 'Rabbi, now were the Jews seeking to stone thee, and again thou dost go thither!'
041109 Jesus answered, 'Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any one may walk in the day, he doth not stumble, because the light of this world he doth see;
041110 and if any one may walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.'
041111 These things he said, and after this he saith to them, 'Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep, but I go on that I may awake him;'
041112 therefore said his disciples, 'Sir, if he hath fallen asleep, he will be saved;'
041113 but Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that about the repose of sleep he speaketh.
041114 Then, therefore, Jesus said to them freely, 'Lazarus hath died;
041115 and I rejoice, for your sake, (that ye may believe,) that I was not there; but we may go to him;'
041116 therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the fellow-disciples, 'We may go -- we also, that we may die with him,'
041117 Jesus, therefore, having come, found him having been four days already in the tomb.
041118 And Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off,
041119 and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning their brother;
041120 Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus doth come, met him, and Mary kept sitting in the house.
041121 Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus, 'Sir, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;
041122 but even now, I have known that whatever thou mayest ask of God, God will give to thee;'
041123 Jesus saith to her, 'Thy brother shall rise again.'
041124 Martha saith to him, 'I have known that he will rise again, in the rising again in the last day;'
041125 Jesus said to her, 'I am the rising again, and the life; he who is believing in me, even if he may die, shall live;
041126 and every one who is living and believing in me shall not die -- to the age;
041127 believest thou this?' she saith to him, 'Yes, sir, I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming to the world.'
041128 And these things having said, she went away, and called Mary her sister privately, saying, 'The Teacher is present, and doth call thee;'
041129 she, when she heard, riseth up quickly, and doth come to him;
041130 and Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was in the place where Martha met him;
041131 the Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house, and were comforting her, having seen Mary that she rose up quickly and went forth, followed her, saying -- 'She doth go away to the tomb, that she may weep there.'
041132 Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, 'Sir, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;'
041133 Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and troubled himself, and he said,
041134 'Where have ye laid him?' they say to him, 'Sir, come and see;'
041135 Jesus wept.
041136 The Jews, therefore, said, 'Lo, how he was loving him!'
041137 and certain of them said, 'Was not this one, who did open the eyes of the blind man, able to cause that also this one might not have died?'
041138 Jesus, therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the tomb, and it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it,
041139 Jesus saith, 'Take ye away the stone;' the sister of him who hath died -- Martha -- saith to him, 'Sir, already he stinketh, for he is four days dead;'
041140 Jesus saith to her, 'Said I not to thee, that if thou mayest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?'
041141 They took away, therefore, the stone where the dead was laid, and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, 'Father, I thank Thee, that Thou didst hear me;
041142 and I knew that Thou always dost hear me, but, because of the multitude that is standing by, I said [it], that they may believe that Thou didst send me.'
041143 And these things saying, with a loud voice he cried out, 'Lazarus, come forth;'
041144 and he who died came forth, being bound feet and hands with grave-clothes, and his visage with a napkin was bound about; Jesus saith to them, 'Loose him, and suffer to go.'
041145 Many, therefore, of the Jews who came unto Mary, and beheld what Jesus did, believed in him;
041146 but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus did;
041147 the chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered together a sanhedrim, and said, 'What may we do? because this man doth many signs?
041148 if we may let him alone thus, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and will take away both our place and nation.'
041149 and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest of that year, said to them, 'Ye have not known anything,
041150 nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people, and not the whole nation perish.'
041151 And this he said not of himself, but being chief priest of that year, he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the nation,
041152 and not for the nation only, but that also the children of God, who have been scattered abroad, he may gather together into one.
041153 From that day, therefore, they took counsel together that they may kill him;
041154 Jesus, therefore, was no more freely walking among the Jews, but went away thence to the region nigh the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.
041155 And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves;
041156 they were seeking, therefore, Jesus, and said one with another, standing in the temple, 'What doth appear to you -- that he may not come to the feast?'
041157 and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if any one may know where he is, he may shew [it], so that they may seize him.
041201 Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus, who had died, whom he raised out of the dead;
041202 they made, therefore, to him a supper there, and Martha was ministering, and Lazarus was one of those reclining together (at meat) with him;
041203 Mary, therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of spikenard, of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus and did wipe with her hair his feet, and the house was filled from the fragrance of the ointment.
041204 Therefore saith one of his disciples -- Judas Iscariot, of Simon, who is about to deliver him up --
041205 'Wherefore was not this ointment sold for three hundred denaries, and given to the poor?'
041206 and he said this, not because he was caring for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and what things were put in he was carrying.
041207 Jesus, therefore, said, 'Suffer her; for the day of my embalming she hath kept it,
041208 for the poor ye have always with yourselves, and me ye have not always.'
041209 A great multitude, therefore, of the Jews knew that he is there, and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that Lazarus also they may see, whom he raised out of the dead;
041210 and the chief priests took counsel, that also Lazarus they may kill,
041211 because on account of him many of the Jews were going away, and were believing in Jesus.
041212 On the morrow, a great multitude that came to the feast, having heard that Jesus doth come to Jerusalem,
041213 took the branches of the palms, and went forth to meet him, and were crying, 'Hosanna, blessed [is] he who is coming in the name of the Lord -- the king of Israel;'
041214 and Jesus having found a young ass did sit upon it, according as it is written,
041215 'Fear not, daughter of Sion, lo, thy king doth come, sitting on an ass' colt.'
041216 And these things his disciples did not know at the first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were having been written about him, and these things they did to him.
041217 The multitude, therefore, who are with him, were testifying that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and did raise him out of the dead;
041218 because of this also did the multitude meet him, because they heard of his having done this sign,
041219 the Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves, 'Ye see that ye do not gain anything, lo, the world did go after him.'
041220 And there were certain Greeks out of those coming up that they may worship in the feast,
041221 these then came near to Philip, who [is] from Bethsaida of Galilee, and were asking him, saying, 'Sir, we wish to see Jesus;'
041222 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
041223 And Jesus responded to them, saying, 'The hour hath come that the Son of Man may be glorified;
041224 verily, verily, I say to you, if the grain of the wheat, having fallen to the earth, may not die, itself remaineth alone; and if it may die, it doth bear much fruit;
041225 he who is loving his life shall lose it, and he who is hating his life in this world -- to life age-during shall keep it;
041226 if any one may minister to me, let him follow me, and where I am, there also my ministrant shall be; and if any one may minister to me -- honour him will the Father.
041227 'Now hath my soul been troubled, and what? shall I say -- Father, save me from this hour? -- but because of this I came to this hour;
041228 Father, glorify Thy name.' There came, therefore, a voice out of the heaven, 'I both glorified, and again I will glorify [it];'
041229 the multitude, therefore, having stood and heard, were saying that there hath been thunder; others said, 'A messenger hath spoken to him.'
041230 Jesus answered and said, 'Not because of me hath this voice come, but because of you;
041231 now is a judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this world be cast forth;
041232 and I, if I may be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.'
041233 And this he said signifying by what death he was about to die;
041234 the multitude answered him, 'We heard out of the law that the Christ doth remain -- to the age; and how dost thou say, That it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up? who is this -- the Son of Man?'
041235 Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Yet a little time is the light with you; walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you; and he who is walking in the darkness hath not known where he goeth;
041236 while ye have the light, believe in the light, that sons of light ye may become.' These things spake Jesus, and having gone away, he was hid from them,
041237 yet he having done so many signs before them, they were not believing in him,
041238 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said, 'Lord, who gave credence to our report? and the arm of the Lord -- to whom was it revealed?'
041239 Because of this they were not able to believe, that again Isaiah said,
041240 'He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they might not see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and turn back, and I might heal them;'
041241 these things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
041242 Still, however, also out of the rulers did many believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing, that they might not be put out of the synagogue,
041243 for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
041244 And Jesus cried and said, 'He who is believing in me, doth not believe in me, but in Him who sent me;
041245 and he who is beholding me, doth behold Him who sent me;
041246 I a light to the world have come, that every one who is believing in me -- in the darkness may not remain;
041247 and if any one may hear my sayings, and not believe, I -- I do not judge him, for I came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.
041248 'He who is rejecting me, and not receiving my sayings, hath one who is judging him, the word that I spake, that will judge him in the last day,
041249 because I spake not from myself, but the Father who sent me, He did give me a command, what I may say, and what I may speak,
041250 and I have known that His command is life age-during; what, therefore, I speak, according as the Father hath said to me, so I speak.'
041301 And before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour hath come, that he may remove out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own who [are] in the world -- to the end he loved them.
041302 And supper being come, the devil already having put [it] into the heart of Judas of Simon, Iscariot, that he may deliver him up,
041303 Jesus knowing that all things the Father hath given to him -- into [his] hands, and that from God he came forth, and unto God he goeth,
041304 doth rise from the supper, and doth lay down his garments, and having taken a towel, he girded himself;
041305 afterward he putteth water into the basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe with the towel with which he was being girded.
041306 He cometh, therefore, unto Simon Peter, and that one saith to him, 'Sir, thou -- dost thou wash my feet?'
041307 Jesus answered and said to him, 'That which I do thou hast not known now, but thou shalt know after these things;'
041308 Peter saith to him, 'Thou mayest not wash my feet -- to the age.' Jesus answered him, 'If I may not wash thee, thou hast no part with me;'
041309 Simon Peter saith to him, 'Sir, not my feet only, but also the hands and the head.'
041310 Jesus saith to him, 'He who hath been bathed hath no need save to wash his feet, but he is clean altogether; and ye are clean, but not all;'
041311 for he knew him who is delivering him up; because of this he said, 'Ye are not all clean.'
041312 When, therefore, he washed their feet, and took his garments, having reclined (at meat) again, he said to them, 'Do ye know what I have done to you?
041313 ye call me, The Teacher and The Lord, and ye say well, for I am;
041314 if then I did wash your feet -- the Lord and the Teacher -- ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
041315 'For an example I gave to you, that, according as I did to you, ye also may do;
041316 verily, verily, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his lord, nor an apostle greater than he who sent him;
041317 if these things ye have known, happy are ye, if ye may do them;
041318 not concerning you all do I speak; I have known whom I chose for myself; but that the Writing may be fulfilled: He who is eating the bread with me, did lift up against me his heel.
041319 'From this time I tell you, before its coming to pass, that, when it may come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he];
041320 verily, verily, I say to you, he who is receiving whomsoever I may send, doth receive me; and he who is receiving me, doth receive Him who sent me.'
041321 These things having said, Jesus was troubled in the spirit, and did testify, and said, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you will deliver me up;'
041322 the disciples were looking, therefore, one at another, doubting concerning whom he speaketh.
041323 And there was one of his disciples reclining (at meat) in the bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus was loving;
041324 Simon Peter, then, doth beckon to this one, to inquire who he may be concerning whom he speaketh,
041325 and that one having leant back on the breast of Jesus, respondeth to him, 'Sir, who is it?'
041326 Jesus answereth, 'That one it is to whom I, having dipped the morsel, shall give it;' and having dipped the morsel, he giveth [it] to Judas of Simon, Iscariot.
041327 And after the morsel, then the Adversary entered into that one, Jesus, therefore, saith to him, 'What thou dost -- do quickly;'
041328 and none of those reclining at meat knew for what intent he said this to him,
041329 for certain were thinking, since Judas had the bag, that Jesus saith to him, 'Buy what we have need of for the feast;' or that he may give something to the poor;
041330 having received, therefore, the morsel, that one immediately went forth, and it was night.
041331 When, therefore, he went forth, Jesus saith, 'Now was the Son of Man glorified, and God was glorified in him;
041332 if God was glorified in him, God also will glorify him in Himself; yea, immediately He will glorify him.
041333 'Little children, yet a little am I with you; ye will seek me, and, according as I said to the Jews -- Whither I go away, ye are not able to come, to you also I do say [it] now.
041334 'A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; according as I did love you, that ye also love one another;
041335 in this shall all know that ye are my disciples, if ye may have love one to another.'
041336 Simon Peter saith to him, 'Sir, whither dost thou go away?' Jesus answered him, 'Whither I go away, thou art not able now to follow me, but afterward thou shalt follow me.'
041337 Peter saith to him, 'Sir, wherefore am I not able to follow thee now? my life for thee I will lay down;'
041338 Jesus answered him, 'Thy life for me thou wilt lay down! verily, verily, I say to thee, a cock will not crow till thou mayest deny me thrice.'
041401 'Let not your heart be troubled, believe in God, also in me believe;
041402 in the house of my Father are many mansions; and if not, I would have told you; I go on to prepare a place for you;
041403 and if I go on and prepare for you a place, again do I come, and will receive you unto myself, that where I am ye also may be;
041404 and whither I go away ye have known, and the way ye have known.'
041405 Thomas saith to him, 'Sir, we have not known whither thou goest away, and how are we able to know the way?'
041406 Jesus saith to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life, no one doth come unto the Father, if not through me;
041407 if ye had known me, my Father also ye would have known, and from this time ye have known Him, and have seen Him.'
041408 Philip saith to him, 'Sir, shew to us the Father, and it is enough for us;'
041409 Jesus saith to him, 'So long time am I with you, and thou hast not known me, Philip? he who hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how dost thou say, Shew to us the Father?
041410 Believest thou not that I [am] in the Father, and the Father is in me? the sayings that I speak to you, from myself I speak not, and the Father who is abiding in me, Himself doth the works;
041411 believe me, that I [am] in the Father, and the Father in me; and if not, because of the works themselves, believe me.
041412 'Verily, verily, I say to you, he who is believing in me, the works that I do -- that one also shall do, and greater than these he shall do, because I go on to my Father;
041413 and whatever ye may ask in my name, I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son;
041414 if ye ask anything in my name I will do [it].
041415 'If ye love me, my commands keep,
041416 and I will ask the Father, and another Comforter He will give to you, that he may remain with you -- to the age;
041417 the Spirit of truth, whom the world is not able to receive, because it doth not behold him, nor know him, and ye know him, because he doth remain with you, and shall be in you.
041418 'I will not leave you bereaved, I come unto you;
041419 yet a little, and the world doth no more behold me, and ye behold me, because I live, and ye shall live;
041420 in that day ye shall know that I [am] in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you;
041421 he who is having my commands, and is keeping them, that one it is who is loving me, and he who is loving me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.'
041422 Judas saith to him, (not the Iscariot), 'Sir, what hath come to pass, that to us thou are about to manifest thyself, and not to the world?'
041423 Jesus answered and said to him, 'If any one may love me, my word he will keep, and my Father will love him, and unto him we will come, and abode with him we will make;
041424 he who is not loving me, my words doth not keep; and the word that ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.
041425 'These things I have spoken to you, remaining with you,
041426 and the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and remind you of all things that I said to you.
041427 'Peace I leave to you; my peace I give to you, not according as the world doth give do I give to you; let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid;
041428 ye heard that I said to you -- I go away, and I come unto you; if ye did love me, ye would have rejoiced that I said -- I go on to the Father, because my Father is greater than I.
041429 'And now I have said [it] to you before it come to pass, that when it may come to pass, ye may believe;
041430 I will no more talk much with you, for the ruler of this world doth come, and in me he hath nothing;
041431 but that the world may know that I love the Father, and according as the Father gave me command so I do; arise, we may go hence.
041501 'I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman;
041502 every branch in me not bearing fruit, He doth take it away, and every one bearing fruit, He doth cleanse by pruning it, that it may bear more fruit;
041503 already ye are clean, because of the word that I have spoken to you;
041504 remain in me, and I in you, as the branch is not able to bear fruit of itself, if it may not remain in the vine, so neither ye, if ye may not remain in me.
041505 'I am the vine, ye the branches; he who is remaining in me, and I in him, this one doth bear much fruit, because apart from me ye are not able to do anything;
041506 if any one may not remain in me, he was cast forth without as the branch, and was withered, and they gather them, and cast to fire, and they are burned;
041507 if ye may remain in me, and my sayings in you may remain, whatever ye may wish ye shall ask, and it shall be done to you.
041508 'In this was my Father glorified, that ye may bear much fruit, and ye shall become my disciples.
041509 According as the Father did love me, I also loved you, remain in my love;
041510 if my commandments ye may keep, ye shall remain in my love, according as I the commands of my Father have kept, and do remain in His love;
041511 these things I have spoken to you, that my joy in you may remain, and your joy may be full.
041512 'This is my command, that ye love one another, according as I did love you;
041513 greater love than this hath no one, that any one his life may lay down for his friends;
041514 ye are my friends, if ye may do whatever I command you;
041515 no more do I call you servants, because the servant hath not known what his lord doth, and you I have called friends, because all things that I heard from my Father, I did make known to you.
041516 'Ye did not choose out me, but I chose out you, and did appoint you, that ye might go away, and might bear fruit, and your fruit might remain, that whatever ye may ask of the Father in my name, He may give you.
041517 'These things I command you, that ye love one another;
041518 if the world doth hate you, ye know that it hath hated me before you;
041519 if of the world ye were, the world its own would have been loving, and because of the world ye are not -- but I chose out of the world -- because of this the world hateth you.
041520 'Remember the word that I said to you, A servant is not greater than his lord; if me they did persecute, you also they will persecute; if my word they did keep, yours also they will keep;
041521 but all these things will they do to you, because of my name, because they have not known Him who sent me;
041522 if I had not come and spoken to them, they were not having sin; but now pretext they have not for their sin.
041523 'He who is hating me, doth hate also my Father;
041524 if I did not do among them the works that no other hath done, they were not having sin, and now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father;
041525 but -- that the word may be fulfilled that was written in their law -- They hated me without a cause.
041526 'And when the Comforter may come, whom I will send to you from the Father -- the Spirit of truth, who from the Father doth come forth, he will testify of me;
041527 and ye also do testify, because from the beginning ye are with me.
041601 'These things I have spoken to you, that ye may not be stumbled,
041602 out of the synagogues they will put you; but an hour doth come, that every one who hath killed you, may think to offer service unto God;
041603 and these things they will do to you, because they did not know the Father, nor me.
041604 'But these things I have spoken to you, that when the hour may come, ye may remember them, that I said [them] to you, and these things to you from the beginning I did not say, because I was with you;
041605 and now I go away to Him who sent me, and none of you doth ask me, Whither dost thou go?
041606 but because these things I have said to you, the sorrow hath filled your heart.
041607 'But I tell you the truth; it is better for you that I go away, for if I may not go away, the Comforter will not come unto you, and if I go on, I will send Him unto you;
041608 and having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment;
041609 concerning sin indeed, because they do not believe in me;
041610 and concerning righteousness, because unto my Father I go away, and no more do ye behold me;
041611 and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world hath been judged.
041612 'I have yet many things to say to you, but ye are not able to bear [them] now;
041613 and when He may come -- the Spirit of truth -- He will guide you to all the truth, for He will not speak from Himself, but as many things as He will hear He will speak, and the coming things He will tell you;
041614 He will glorify me, because of mine He will take, and will tell to you.
041615 'All things, as many as the Father hath, are mine; because of this I said, That of mine He will take, and will tell to you;
041616 a little while, and ye do not behold me, and again a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go away unto the Father.'
041617 Therefore said [some] of his disciples one to another, 'What is this that he saith to us, A little while, and ye do not behold me, and again a little while, and ye shall see me, and, Because I go away unto the Father?'
041618 they said then, 'What is this he saith -- the little while? we have not known what he saith.'
041619 Jesus, therefore, knew that they were wishing to ask him, and he said to them, 'Concerning this do ye seek one with another, because I said, A little while, and you do not behold me, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?
041620 verily, verily, I say to you, that ye shall weep and lament, and the world will rejoice; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow joy will become.
041621 'The woman, when she may bear, hath sorrow, because her hour did come, and when she may bear the child, no more doth she remember the anguish, because of the joy that a man was born to the world.
041622 'And ye, therefore, now, indeed, have sorrow; and again I will see you, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one doth take from you,
041623 and in that day ye will question me nothing; verily, verily, I say to you, as many things as ye may ask of the Father in my name, He will give you;
041624 till now ye did ask nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
041625 'These things in similitudes I have spoken to you, but there cometh an hour when no more in similitudes will I speak to you, but freely of the Father, will tell you.
041626 'In that day, in my name ye will make request, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father for you,
041627 for the Father himself doth love you, because me ye have loved, and ye have believed that I from God came forth;
041628 I came forth from the Father, and have come to the world; again I leave the world, and go on unto the Father.'
041629 His disciples say to him, 'Lo, now freely thou dost speak, and no similitude speakest thou;
041630 now we have known that thou hast known all things, and hast no need that any one do question thee; in this we believe that from God thou didst come forth.'
041631 Jesus answered them, 'Now do ye believe? lo, there doth come an hour,
041632 and now it hath come, that ye may be scattered, each to his own things, and me ye may leave alone, and I am not alone, because the Father is with me;
041633 these things I have spoken to you, that in me ye may have peace, in the world ye shall have tribulation, but take courage -- I have overcome the world.'
041701 These things spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to the heaven, and said -- 'Father, the hour hath come, glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee,
041702 according as Thou didst give to him authority over all flesh, that -- all that Thou hast given to him -- he may give to them life age-during;
041703 and this is the life age-during, that they may know Thee, the only true God, and him whom Thou didst send -- Jesus Christ;
041704 I did glorify Thee on the earth, the work I did finish that Thou hast given me, that I may do [it].
041705 'And now, glorify me, Thou Father, with Thyself, with the glory that I had before the world was, with Thee;
041706 I did manifest Thy name to the men whom Thou hast given to me out of the world; Thine they were, and to me Thou hast given them, and Thy word they have kept;
041707 now they have known that all things, as many as Thou hast given to me, are from Thee,
041708 because the sayings that Thou hast given to me, I have given to them, and they themselves received, and have known truly, that from Thee I came forth, and they did believe that Thou didst send me.
041709 'I ask in regard to them; not in regard to the world do I ask, but in regard to those whom Thou hast given to me, because Thine they are,
041710 and all mine are Thine, and Thine [are] mine, and I have been glorified in them;
041711 and no more am I in the world, and these are in the world, and I come unto Thee. Holy Father, keep them in Thy name, whom Thou hast given to me, that they may be one as we;
041712 when I was with them in the world, I was keeping them in Thy name; those whom Thou hast given to me I did guard, and none of them was destroyed, except the son of the destruction, that the Writing may be fulfilled.
041713 'And now unto Thee I come, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves;
041714 I have given to them Thy word, and the world did hate them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world;
041715 I do not ask that Thou mayest take them out of the world, but that Thou mayest keep them out of the evil.
041716 'Of the world they are not, as I of the world am not;
041717 sanctify them in Thy truth, Thy word is truth;
041718 as Thou didst send me to the world, I also did send them to the world;
041719 and for them do I sanctify myself, that they also themselves may be sanctified in truth.
041720 'And not in regard to these alone do I ask, but also in regard to those who shall be believing, through their word, in me;
041721 that they all may be one, as Thou Father [art] in me, and I in Thee; that they also in us may be one, that the world may believe that Thou didst send me.
041722 'And I, the glory that thou hast given to me, have given to them, that they may be one as we are one;
041723 I in them, and Thou in me, that they may be perfected into one, and that the world may know that Thou didst send me, and didst love them as Thou didst love me.
041724 'Father, those whom Thou hast given to me, I will that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory that Thou didst give to me, because Thou didst love me before the foundation of the world.
041725 'Righteous Father, also the world did not know Thee, and I knew Thee, and these have known that Thou didst send me,
041726 and I made known to them Thy name, and will make known, that the love with which Thou lovedst me in them may be, and I in them.'
041801 These things having said, Jesus went forth with his disciples beyond the brook of Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples,
041802 and Judas also, who delivered him up, had known the place, because many times did Jesus assemble there with his disciples.
041803 Judas, therefore, having taken the band and officers out of the chief priests and Pharisees, doth come thither with torches and lamps, and weapons;
041804 Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that are coming upon him, having gone forth, said to them, 'Whom do ye seek?'
041805 they answered him, 'Jesus the Nazarene;' Jesus saith to them, 'I am [he];' -- and Judas who delivered him up was standing with them; --
041806 when, therefore, he said to them -- 'I am [he],' they went away backward, and fell to the ground.
041807 Again, therefore, he questioned them, 'Whom do ye seek?' and they said, 'Jesus the Nazarene;'
041808 Jesus answered, 'I said to you that I am [he]; if, then, me ye seek, suffer these to go away;'
041809 that the word might be fulfilled that he said -- 'Those whom Thou hast given to me, I did not lose of them even one.'
041810 Simon Peter, therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the chief priest's servant, and cut off his right ear -- and the name of the servant was Malchus --
041811 Jesus, therefore, said to Peter, 'Put the sword into the sheath; the cup that the Father hath given to me, may I not drink it?'
041812 The band, therefore, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, took hold on Jesus, and bound him,
041813 and they led him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was chief priest of that year,
041814 and Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it is good for one man to perish for the people.
041815 And following Jesus was Simon Peter, and the other disciple, and that disciple was known to the chief priest, and he entered with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest,
041816 and Peter was standing at the door without, therefore went forth the other disciple who was known to the chief priest, and he spake to the female keeping the door, and he brought in Peter.
041817 Then said the maid keeping the door to Peter, 'Art thou also of the disciples of this man?' he saith, 'I am not;'
041818 and the servants and the officers were standing, having made a fire of coals, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.
041819 The chief priests, therefore, questioned Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his teaching;
041820 Jesus answered him, 'I spake freely to the world, I did always teach in a synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews do always come together; and in secret I spake nothing;
041821 why me dost thou question? question those having heard what I spake to them; lo, these have known what I said.'
041822 And he having said these things, one of the officers standing by did give Jesus a slap, saying, 'Thus dost thou answer the chief priest?'
041823 Jesus answered him, 'If I spake ill, testify concerning the ill; and if well, why me dost thou smite?'
041824 Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.
041825 And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself, they said then to him, 'Art thou also of his disciples?' he denied, and said, 'I am not.'
041826 One of the servants of the chief priest, being kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, 'Did not I see thee in the garden with him?'
041827 again, therefore, Peter denied, and immediately a cock crew.
041828 They led, therefore, Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium, and it was early, and they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the passover;
041829 Pilate, therefore, went forth unto them, and said, 'What accusation do ye bring against this man?'
041830 they answered and said to him, 'If he were not an evil doer, we had not delivered him to thee.'
041831 Pilate, therefore, said to them, 'Take ye him -- ye -- and according to your law judge him;' the Jews, therefore, said to him, 'It is not lawful to us to put any one to death;'
041832 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said, signifying by what death he was about to die.
041833 Pilate, therefore, entered into the praetorium again, and called Jesus, and said to him, 'Thou art the King of the Jews?'
041834 Jesus answered him, 'From thyself dost thou say this? or did others say it to thee about me?'
041835 Pilate answered, 'Am I a Jew? thy nation, and the chief priests did deliver thee up to me; what didst thou?'
041836 Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my officers had struggled that I might not be delivered up to Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence.'
041837 Pilate, therefore, said to him, 'Art thou then a king?' Jesus answered, 'Thou dost say [it]; because a king I am, I for this have been born, and for this I have come to the world, that I may testify to the truth; every one who is of the truth, doth hear my voice.'
041838 Pilate saith to him, 'What is truth?' and this having said, again he went forth unto the Jews, and saith to them, 'I do find no fault in him;
041839 and ye have a custom that I shall release to you one in the passover; will ye, therefore, [that] I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'
041840 therefore they all cried out again, saying, 'Not this one -- but Barabbas;' and Barabbas was a robber.
041901 Then, therefore, did Pilate take Jesus and scourge [him],
041902 and the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns, did place [it] on his head, and a purple garment they put around him,
041903 and said, 'Hail! the king of the Jews;' and they were giving him slaps.
041904 Pilate, therefore, again went forth without, and saith to them, 'Lo, I do bring him to you without, that ye may know that in him I find no fault;'
041905 Jesus, therefore, came forth without, bearing the thorny crown and the purple garment; and he saith to them, 'Lo, the man!'
041906 When, therefore, the chief priests and the officers did see him, they cried out, saying, 'Crucify, crucify;' Pilate saith to them, 'Take ye him -- ye, and crucify; for I find no fault in him;'
041907 the Jews answered him, 'We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, for he made himself Son of God.'
041908 When, therefore, Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid,
041909 and entered again to the praetorium, and saith to Jesus, 'Whence art thou?' and Jesus gave him no answer.
041910 Pilate, therefore, saith to him, 'To me dost thou not speak? hast thou not known that I have authority to crucify thee, and I have authority to release thee?'
041911 Jesus answered, 'Thou wouldst have no authority against me, if it were not having been given thee from above; because of this, he who is delivering me up to thee hath greater sin.'
041912 From this [time] was Pilate seeking to release him, and the Jews were crying out, saying, 'If this one thou mayest release, thou art not a friend of Caesar; every one making himself a king, doth speak against Caesar.'
041913 Pilate, therefore, having heard this word, brought Jesus without -- and he sat down upon the tribunal -- to a place called, 'Pavement,' and in Hebrew, Gabbatha;
041914 and it was the preparation of the passover, and as it were the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews, 'Lo, your king!'
041915 and they cried out, 'Take away, take away, crucify him;' Pilate saith to them, 'Your king shall I crucify?' the chief priests answered, 'We have no king except Caesar.'
041916 Then, therefore, he delivered him up to them, that he may be crucified, and they took Jesus and led [him] away,
041917 and bearing his cross, he went forth to the place called [Place] of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha;
041918 where they crucified him, and with him two others, on this side, and on that side, and Jesus in the midst.
041919 And Pilate also wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross, and it was written, 'Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews;'
041920 this title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because the place was nigh to the city where Jesus was crucified, and it was having been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Roman.
041921 The chief priests of the Jews said, therefore, to Pilate, 'Write not -- The king of the Jews, but that one said, I am king of the Jews;'
041922 Pilate answered, 'What I have written, I have written.'
041923 The soldiers, therefore, when they did crucify Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, also the coat, and the coat was seamless, from the top woven throughout,
041924 they said, therefore, to one another, 'We may not rend it, but cast a lot for it, whose it shall be;' that the Writing might be fulfilled, that is saying, 'They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my raiment they did cast a lot;' the soldiers, therefore, indeed, did these things.
041925 And there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene;
041926 Jesus, therefore, having seen [his] mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he was loving, he saith to his mother, 'Woman, lo, thy son;'
041927 afterward he saith to the disciple, 'Lo, thy mother;' and from that hour the disciple took her to his own [home].
041928 After this, Jesus knowing that all things now have been finished, that the Writing may be fulfilled, saith, 'I thirst;'
041929 a vessel, therefore, was placed full of vinegar, and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, and having put [it] around a hyssop stalk, did put [it] to his mouth;
041930 when, therefore, Jesus received the vinegar, he said, 'It hath been finished;' and having bowed the head, gave up the spirit.
041931 The Jews, therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for that sabbath day was a great one,) asked of Pilate that their legs may be broken, and they taken away.
041932 The soldiers, therefore, came, and of the first indeed they did break the legs, and of the other who was crucified with him,
041933 and having come to Jesus, when they saw him already having been dead, they did not break his legs;
041934 but one of the soldiers with a spear did pierce his side, and immediately there came forth blood and water;
041935 and he who hath seen hath testified, and his testimony is true, and that one hath known that true things he speaketh, that ye also may believe.
041936 For these things came to pass, that the Writing may be fulfilled, 'A bone of him shall not be broken;'
041937 and again another Writing saith, 'They shall look to him whom they did pierce.'
041938 And after these things did Joseph of Arimathea -- being a disciple of Jesus, but concealed, through the fear of the Jews -- ask of Pilate, that he may take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave leave; he came, therefore, and took away the body of Jesus,
041939 and Nicodemus also came -- who came unto Jesus by night at the first -- bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, as it were, a hundred pounds.
041940 They took, therefore, the body of Jesus, and bound it with linen clothes with the spices, according as it was the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial;
041941 and there was in the place where he was crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was yet laid;
041942 there, therefore, because of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was nigh, they laid Jesus.
042001 And on the first of the sabbaths, Mary the Magdalene doth come early (there being yet darkness) to the tomb, and she seeth the stone having been taken away out of the tomb,
042002 she runneth, therefore, and cometh unto Simon Peter, and unto the other disciple whom Jesus was loving, and saith to them, 'They took away the Lord out of the tomb, and we have not known where they laid him.'
042003 Peter, therefore, went forth, and the other disciple, and they were coming to the tomb,
042004 and the two were running together, and the other disciple did run forward more quickly than Peter, and came first to the tomb,
042005 and having stooped down, seeth the linen clothes lying, yet, indeed, he entered not.
042006 Simon Peter, therefore, cometh, following him, and he entered into the tomb, and beholdeth the linen clothes lying,
042007 and the napkin that was upon his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but apart, having been folded up, in one place;
042008 then, therefore, entered also the other disciple who came first unto the tomb, and he saw, and did believe;
042009 for not yet did they know the Writing, that it behoveth him out of the dead to rise again.
042010 The disciples therefore went away again unto their own friends,
042011 and Mary was standing near the tomb, weeping without; as she was weeping, then, she stooped down to the tomb, and beholdeth two messengers in white, sitting,
042012 one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.
042013 And they say to her, 'Woman, why dost thou weep?' she saith to them, 'Because they took away my Lord, and I have not known where they laid him;'
042014 and these things having said, she turned backward, and seeth Jesus standing, and she had not known that it is Jesus.
042015 Jesus saith to her, 'Woman, why dost thou weep? whom dost thou seek;' she, supposing that he is the gardener, saith to him, 'Sir, if thou didst carry him away, tell me where thou didst lay him, and I will take him away;'
042016 Jesus saith to her, 'Mary!' having turned, she saith to him, 'Rabbouni;' that is to say, 'Teacher.'
042017 Jesus saith to her, 'Be not touching me, for I have not yet ascended unto my Father; and be going on to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and to your God.'
042018 Mary the Magdalene cometh, telling to the disciples that she hath seen the Lord, and [that] these things he said to her.
042019 It being, therefore, evening, on that day, the first of the sabbaths, and the doors having been shut where the disciples were assembled, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, 'Peace to you;'
042020 and this having said, he shewed them his hands and side; the disciples, therefore, rejoiced, having seen the Lord.
042021 Jesus, therefore, said to them again, 'Peace to you; according as the Father hath sent me, I also send you;'
042022 and this having said, he breathed on [them], and saith to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit;
042023 if of any ye may loose the sins, they are loosed to them; if of any ye may retain, they have been retained.'
042024 And Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came;
042025 the other disciples, therefore, said to him, 'We have seen the Lord;' and he said to them, 'If I may not see in his hands the mark of the nails, and may put my finger to the mark of the nails, and may put my hand to his side, I will not believe.'
042026 And after eight days, again were his disciples within, and Thomas with them; Jesus cometh, the doors having been shut, and he stood in the midst, and said, 'Peace to you!'
042027 then he saith to Thomas, 'Bring thy finger hither, and see my hands, and bring thy hand, and put [it] to my side, and become not unbelieving, but believing.'
042028 And Thomas answered and said to him, 'My Lord and my God;'
042029 Jesus saith to him, 'Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed; happy those not having seen, and having believed.'
042030 Many indeed, therefore, other signs also did Jesus before his disciples, that are not written in this book;
042031 and these have been written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in his name.'
042101 After these things did Jesus manifest himself again to the disciples on the sea of Tiberias, and he did manifest himself thus:
042102 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas who is called Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
042103 Simon Peter saith to them, 'I go away to fish;' they say to him, 'We go -- we also -- with thee;' they went forth and entered into the boat immediately, and on that night they caught nothing.
042104 And morning being now come, Jesus stood at the shore, yet indeed the disciples did not know that it is Jesus;
042105 Jesus, therefore, saith to them, 'Lads, have ye any meat?'
042106 they answered him, 'No;' and he said to them, 'Cast the net at the right side of the boat, and ye shall find;' they cast, therefore, and no longer were they able to draw it, from the multitude of the fishes.
042107 That disciple, therefore, whom Jesus was loving saith to Peter, 'The Lord it is!' Simon Peter, therefore, having heard that it is the Lord, did gird on the outer coat, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea;
042108 and the other disciples came by the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but as it were about two hundred cubits off, dragging the net of the fishes;
042109 when, therefore, they came to the land, they behold a fire of coals lying, and a fish lying on it, and bread.
042110 Jesus saith to them, 'Bring ye from the fishes that ye caught now;'
042111 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net up on the land, full of great fishes, an hundred fifty and three, and though they were so many, the net was not rent.
042112 Jesus saith to them, 'Come ye, dine;' and none of the disciples was venturing to inquire of him, 'Who art thou?' knowing that it is the Lord;
042113 Jesus, therefore, doth come and take the bread and give to them, and the fish in like manner;
042114 this [is] now a third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples, having been raised from the dead.
042115 When, therefore, they dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, 'Simon, [son] of Jonas, dost thou love me more than these?' he saith to him, 'Yes, Lord; thou hast known that I dearly love thee;' he saith to him, 'Feed my lambs.'
042116 He saith to him again, a second time, 'Simon, [son] of Jonas, dost thou love me?' he saith to him, 'Yes, Lord; thou hast known that I dearly love thee;' he saith to him, 'Tend my sheep.'
042117 He saith to him the third time, 'Simon, [son] of Jonas, dost thou dearly love me?' Peter was grieved that he said to him the third time, 'Dost thou dearly love me?' and he said to him, 'Lord, thou hast known all things; thou dost know that I dearly love thee.' Jesus saith to him, 'Feed my sheep;
042118 verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast younger, thou wast girding thyself and wast walking whither thou didst will, but when thou mayest be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another will gird thee, and shall carry [thee] whither thou dost not will;'
042119 and this he said, signifying by what death he shall glorify God; and having said this, he saith to him, 'Be following me.'
042120 And Peter having turned about doth see the disciple whom Jesus was loving following, (who also reclined in the supper on his breast, and said, 'Sir, who is he who is delivering thee up?')
042121 Peter having seen this one, saith to Jesus, 'Lord, and what of this one?'
042122 Jesus saith to him, 'If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to thee? be thou following me.' This word, therefore, went forth to the brethren that that disciple doth not die,
042123 yet Jesus did not say to him, that he doth not die, but, 'If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to thee?'
042124 this is the disciple who is testifying concerning these things, and he wrote these things, and we have known that his testimony is true.
042125 And there are also many other things -- as many as Jesus did -- which, if they may be written one by one, not even the world itself I think to have place for the books written. Amen.
050101 The former account, indeed, I made concerning all things, O Theophilus, that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
050102 till the day in which, having given command, through the Holy Spirit, to the apostles whom he did choose out, he was taken up,
050103 to whom also he did present himself alive after his suffering, in many certain proofs, through forty days being seen by them, and speaking the things concerning the reign of God.
050104 And being assembled together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, [saith he,] 'Ye did hear of me;
050105 because John, indeed, baptized with water, and ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit -- after not many days.'
050106 They, therefore, indeed, having come together, were questioning him, saying, 'Lord, dost thou at this time restore the reign to Israel?'
050107 and he said unto them, 'It is not yours to know times or seasons that the Father did appoint in His own authority;
050108 but ye shall receive power at the coming of the Holy Spirit upon you, and ye shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and unto the end of the earth.'
050109 And these things having said -- they beholding -- he was taken up, and a cloud did receive him up from their sight;
050110 and as they were looking stedfastly to the heaven in his going on, then, lo, two men stood by them in white apparel,
050111 who also said, 'Men, Galileans, why do ye stand gazing into the heaven? this Jesus who was received up from you into the heaven, shall so come in what manner ye saw him going on to the heaven.'
050112 Then did they return to Jerusalem from the mount that is called of Olives, that is near Jerusalem, a sabbath's journey;
050113 and when they came in, they went up to the upper room, where were abiding both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James, of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zelotes, and Judas, of James;
050114 these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
050115 And in these days, Peter having risen up in the midst of the disciples, said, (the multitude also of the names at the same place was, as it were, an hundred and twenty,)
050116 'Men, brethren, it behoved this Writing that it be fulfilled that beforehand the Holy Spirit spake through the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus,
050117 because he was numbered among us, and did receive the share in this ministration,
050118 this one, indeed, then, purchased a field out of the reward of unrighteousness, and falling headlong, burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed forth,
050119 and it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, insomuch that that place is called, in their proper dialect, Aceldama, that is, field of blood,
050120 for it hath been written in the book of Psalms: Let his lodging-place become desolate, and let no one be dwelling in it, and his oversight let another take.
050121 'It behoveth, therefore, of the men who did go with us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,
050122 beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day in which he was received up from us, one of these to become with us a witness of his rising again.'
050123 And they set two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias,
050124 and having prayed, they said, 'Thou, Lord, who art knowing the heart of all, shew which one thou didst choose of these two
050125 to receive the share of this ministration and apostleship, from which Judas, by transgression, did fall, to go on to his proper place;'
050126 and they gave their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
050201 And in the day of the Pentecost being fulfilled, they were all with one accord at the same place,
050202 and there came suddenly out of the heaven a sound as of a bearing violent breath, and it filled all the house where they were sitting,
050203 and there appeared to them divided tongues, as it were of fire; it sat also upon each one of them,
050204 and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, according as the Spirit was giving them to declare.
050205 And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation of those under the heaven,
050206 and the rumour of this having come, the multitude came together, and was confounded, because they were each one hearing them speaking in his proper dialect,
050207 and they were all amazed, and did wonder, saying one unto another, 'Lo, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
050208 and how do we hear, each in our proper dialect, in which we were born?
050209 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, in Judea also, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,
050210 Phrygia also, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya, that [are] along Cyrene, and the strangers of Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
050211 Cretes and Arabians, we did hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.'
050212 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one unto another, 'What would this wish to be?'
050213 and others mocking said, -- 'They are full of sweet wine;'
050214 and Peter having stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and declared to them, 'Men, Jews! and all those dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and harken to my sayings,
050215 for these are not drunken, as ye take it up, for it is the third hour of the day.
050216 'But this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel:
050217 And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;
050218 and also upon My men-servants, and upon My maid-servants, in those days, I will pour out of My Spirit, and they shall prophesy;
050219 and I will give wonders in the heaven above, and signs upon the earth beneath -- blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke,
050220 the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the day of the Lord -- the great and illustrious;
050221 and it shall be, every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.
050222 'Men, Israelites! hear these words, Jesus the Nazarene, a man approved of God among you by mighty works, and wonders, and signs, that God did through him in the midst of you, according as also ye yourselves have known;
050223 this one, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, being given out, having taken by lawless hands, having crucified -- ye did slay;
050224 whom God did raise up, having loosed the pains of the death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it,
050225 for David saith in regard to him: I foresaw the Lord always before me -- because He is on my right hand -- that I may not be moved;
050226 because of this was my heart cheered, and my tongue was glad, and yet -- my flesh also shall rest on hope,
050227 because Thou wilt not leave my soul to hades, nor wilt Thou give Thy Kind One to see corruption;
050228 Thou didst make known to me ways of life, Thou shalt fill me with joy with Thy countenance.
050229 'Men, brethren! it is permitted to speak with freedom unto you concerning the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is among us unto this day;
050230 a prophet, therefore, being, and knowing that with an oath God did swear to him, out of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up the Christ, to sit upon his throne,
050231 having foreseen, he did speak concerning the rising again of the Christ, that his soul was not left to hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
050232 'This Jesus did God raise up, of which we are all witnesses;
050233 at the right hand then of God having been exalted -- also the promise of the Holy Spirit having received from the Father -- he was shedding forth this, which now ye see and hear;
050234 for David did not go up to the heavens, and he saith himself: The Lord saith to my lord, Sit thou at my right hand,
050235 till I make thy foes thy footstool;
050236 assuredly, therefore, let all the house of Israel know, that both Lord and Christ did God make him -- this Jesus whom ye did crucify.'
050237 And having heard, they were pricked to the heart; they say also to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, 'What shall we do, men, brethren?'
050238 and Peter said unto them, 'Reform, and be baptized each of you on the name of Jesus Christ, to remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,
050239 for to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.'
050240 Also with many more other words he was testifying and exhorting, saying, 'Be saved from this perverse generation;'
050241 then those, indeed, who did gladly receive his word were baptized, and there were added on that day, as it were, three thousand souls,
050242 and they were continuing stedfastly in the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of the bread, and the prayers.
050243 And fear came on every soul, many wonders also and signs were being done through the apostles,
050244 and all those believing were at the same place, and had all things common,
050245 and the possessions and the goods they were selling, and were parting them to all, according as any one had need.
050246 Daily also continuing with one accord in the temple, breaking also at every house bread, they were partaking of food in gladness and simplicity of heart,
050247 praising God, and having favour with all the people, and the Lord was adding those being saved every day to the assembly.
050301 And Peter and John were going up at the same time to the temple, at the hour of the prayer, the ninth [hour],
050302 and a certain man, being lame from the womb of his mother, was being carried, whom they were laying every day at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask a kindness from those entering into the temple,
050303 who, having seen Peter and John about to go into the temple, was begging to receive a kindness.
050304 And Peter, having looked stedfastly toward him with John, said, 'Look toward us;'
050305 and he was giving heed to them, looking to receive something from them;
050306 and Peter said, 'Silver and gold I have none, but what I have, that I give to thee; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and be walking.'
050307 And having seized him by the right hand, he raised [him] up, and presently his feet and ankles were strengthened,
050308 and springing up, he stood, and was walking, and did enter with them into the temple, walking and springing, and praising God;
050309 and all the people saw him walking and praising God,
050310 they were knowing him also that this it was who for a kindness was sitting at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what hath happened to him.
050311 And at the lame man who was healed holding Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch called Solomon's -- greatly amazed,
050312 and Peter having seen, answered unto the people, 'Men, Israelites! why wonder ye at this? or on us why look ye so earnestly, as if by our own power or piety we have made him to walk?
050313 'The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, did glorify His child Jesus, whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, he having given judgment to release [him],
050314 and ye the Holy and Righteous One did deny, and desired a man -- a murderer -- to be granted to you,
050315 and the Prince of the life ye did kill, whom God did raise out of the dead, of which we are witnesses;
050316 and on the faith of his name, this one whom ye see and have known, his name made strong, even the faith that [is] through him did give to him this perfect soundness before you all.
050317 'And now, brethren, I have known that through ignorance ye did [it], as also your rulers;
050318 and God, what things before He had declared through the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ should suffer, He did thus fulfil;
050319 reform ye, therefore, and turn back, for your sins being blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,
050320 and He may send Jesus Christ who before hath been preached to you,
050321 whom it behoveth heaven, indeed, to receive till times of a restitution of all things, of which God spake through the mouth of all His holy prophets from the age.
050322 'For Moses, indeed, unto the fathers said -- A prophet to you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your brethren, like to me; him shall ye hear in all things, as many as he may speak unto you;
050323 and it shall be, every soul that may not hear that prophet shall be utterly destroyed out of the people;
050324 and also all the prophets from Samuel and those following in order, as many as spake, did also foretell of these days.
050325 'Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made unto our fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall be blessed all the families of the earth;
050326 to you first, God, having raised up His child Jesus, did send him, blessing you, in the turning away of each one from your evil ways.'
050401 And as they are speaking unto the people, there came to them the priests, and the magistrate of the temple, and the Sadducees --
050402 being grieved because of their teaching the people, and preaching in Jesus the rising again out of the dead --
050403 and they laid hands upon them, and did put them in custody unto the morrow, for it was evening already;
050404 and many of those hearing the word did believe, and the number of the men became, as it were, five thousand.
050405 And it came to pass upon the morrow, there were gathered together of them the rulers, and elders, and scribes, to Jerusalem,
050406 and Annas the chief priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the chief priest,
050407 and having set them in the midst, they were inquiring, 'In what power, or in what name did ye do this?'
050408 Then Peter, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them: 'Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
050409 if we to-day are examined concerning the good deed to the ailing man, by whom he hath been saved,
050410 be it known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye did crucify, whom God did raise out of the dead, in him hath this one stood by before you whole.
050411 'This is the stone that was set at nought by you -- the builders, that became head of a corner;
050412 and there is not salvation in any other, for there is no other name under the heaven that hath been given among men, in which it behoveth us to be saved.'
050413 And beholding the openness of Peter and John, and having perceived that they are men unlettered and plebeian, they were wondering -- they were taking knowledge also of them that with Jesus they had been --
050414 and seeing the man standing with them who hath been healed, they had nothing to say against [it],
050415 and having commanded them to go away out of the sanhedrim, they took counsel with one another,
050416 saying, 'What shall we do to these men? because that, indeed, a notable sign hath been done through them, to all those dwelling in Jerusalem [is] manifest, and we are not able to deny [it];
050417 but that it may spread no further toward the people, let us strictly threaten them no more to speak in this name to any man.'
050418 And having called them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor to teach, in the name of Jesus,
050419 and Peter and John answering unto them said, 'Whether it is righteous before God to hearken to you rather than to God, judge ye;
050420 for we cannot but speak what we did see and hear.'
050421 And they having further threatened [them], let them go, finding nothing how they may punish them, because of the people, because all were glorifying God for that which hath been done,
050422 for above forty years of age was the man upon whom had been done this sign of the healing.
050423 And being let go, they went unto their own friends, and declared whatever the chief priests and the elders said unto them,
050424 and they having heard, with one accord did lift up the voice unto God, and said, 'Lord, thou [art] God, who didst make the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that [are] in them,
050425 who, through the mouth of David thy servant, did say, Why did nations rage, and peoples meditate vain things?
050426 the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ;
050427 for gathered together of a truth against Thy holy child Jesus, whom Thou didst anoint, were both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with nations and peoples of Israel,
050428 to do whatever Thy hand and Thy counsel did determine before to come to pass.
050429 'And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and grant to Thy servants with all freedom to speak Thy word,
050430 in the stretching forth of Thy hand, for healing, and signs, and wonders, to come to pass through the name of Thy holy child Jesus.'
050431 And they having prayed, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and were speaking the word of God with freedom,
050432 and of the multitude of those who did believe the heart and the soul was one, and not one was saying that anything of the things he had was his own, but all things were to them in common.
050433 And with great power were the apostles giving the testimony to the rising again of the Lord Jesus, great grace also was on them all,
050434 for there was not any one among them who did lack, for as many as were possessors of fields, or houses, selling [them], were bringing the prices of the thing sold,
050435 and were laying them at the feet of the apostles, and distribution was being made to each according as any one had need.
050436 And Joses, who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas -- which is, having been interpreted, Son of Comfort -- a Levite, of Cyprus by birth,
050437 a field being his, having sold [it], brought the money and laid [it] at the feet of the apostles.
050501 And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
050502 and did keep back of the price -- his wife also knowing -- and having brought a certain part, at the feet of the apostles he laid [it].
050503 And Peter said, 'Ananias, wherefore did the Adversary fill thy heart, for thee to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back of the price of the place?
050504 while it remained, did it not remain thine? and having been sold, in thy authority was it not? why [is] it that thou didst put in thy heart this thing? thou didst not lie to men, but to God;'
050505 and Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, did expire, and great fear came upon all who heard these things,
050506 and having risen, the younger men wound him up, and having carried forth, they buried [him].
050507 And it came to pass, about three hours after, that his wife, not knowing what hath happened, came in,
050508 and Peter answered her, 'Tell me if for so much ye sold the place;' and she said, 'Yes, for so much.'
050509 And Peter said unto her, 'How was it agreed by you, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? lo, the feet of those who did bury thy husband [are] at the door, and they shall carry thee forth;'
050510 and she fell down presently at his feet, and expired, and the young men having come in, found her dead, and having carried forth, they buried [her] by her husband;
050511 and great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things.
050512 And through the hands of the apostles came many signs and wonders among the people, and they were with one accord all in the porch of Solomon;
050513 and of the rest no one was daring to join himself to them, but the people were magnifying them,
050514 (and the more were believers added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,)
050515 so as into the broad places to bring forth the ailing, and to lay [them] upon couches and mats, that at the coming of Peter, even [his] shadow might overshadow some one of them;
050516 and there were coming together also the people of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bearing ailing persons, and those harassed by unclean spirits -- who were all healed.
050517 And having risen, the chief priest, and all those with him -- being the sect of the Sadducees -- were filled with zeal,
050518 and laid their hands upon the apostles, and did put them in a public prison;
050519 and a messenger of the Lord through the night opened the doors of the prison, having also brought them forth, he said,
050520 'Go on, and standing, speak in the temple to the people all the sayings of this life;'
050521 and having heard, they did enter at the dawn into the temple, and were teaching. And the chief priest having come, and those with him, they called together the sanhedrim and all the senate of the sons of Israel, and they sent to the prison to have them brought,
050522 and the officers having come, did not find them in the prison, and having turned back, they told,
050523 saying -- 'The prison indeed we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors, and having opened -- within we found no one.'
050524 And as the priest, and the magistrate of the temple, and the chief priests, heard these words, they were doubting concerning them to what this would come;
050525 and coming near, a certain one told them, saying -- 'Lo, the men whom ye did put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people;'
050526 then the magistrate having gone away with officers, brought them without violence, for they were fearing the people, lest they should be stoned;
050527 and having brought them, they set [them] in the sanhedrim, and the chief priest questioned them,
050528 saying, 'Did not we strictly command you not to teach in this name? and lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and ye intend to bring upon us the blood of this man.'
050529 And Peter and the apostles answering, said, 'To obey God it behoveth, rather than men;
050530 and the God of our fathers did raise up Jesus, whom ye slew, having hanged upon a tree;
050531 this one God, a Prince and a Saviour, hath exalted with His right hand, to give reformation to Israel, and forgiveness of sins;
050532 and we are His witnesses of these sayings, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God gave to those obeying him.'
050533 And they having heard, were cut [to the heart], and were taking counsel to slay them,
050534 but a certain one, having risen up in the sanhedrim -- a Pharisee, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of law honoured by all the people -- commanded to put the apostles forth a little,
050535 and said unto them, 'Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves about these men, what ye are about to do,
050536 for before these days rose up Theudas, saying, that himself was some one, to whom a number of men did join themselves, as it were four hundred, who was slain, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered, and came to nought.
050537 'After this one rose up, Judas the Galilean, in the days of the enrollment, and drew away much people after him, and that one perished, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered;
050538 and now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone, because if this counsel or this work may be of men, it will be overthrown,
050539 and if it be of God, ye are not able to overthrow it, lest perhaps also ye be found fighting against God.'
050540 And to him they agreed, and having called near the apostles, having beaten [them], they commanded [them] not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go;
050541 they, indeed, then, departed from the presence of the sanhedrim, rejoicing that for his name they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour,
050542 every day also in the temple, and in every house, they were not ceasing teaching and proclaiming good news -- Jesus the Christ.
050601 And in these days, the disciples multiplying, there came a murmuring of the Hellenists at the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily ministration,
050602 and the twelve, having called near the multitude of the disciples, said, 'It is not pleasing that we, having left the word of God, do minister at tables;
050603 look out, therefore, brethren, seven men of you who are well testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may set over this necessity,
050604 and we to prayer, and to the ministration of the word, will give ourselves continually.'
050605 And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude, and they did choose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,
050606 whom they did set before the apostles, and they, having prayed, laid on them [their] hands.
050607 And the word of God did increase, and the number of the disciples did multiply in Jerusalem exceedingly; a great multitude also of the priests were obedient to the faith.
050608 And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people,
050609 and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, called of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia, and Asia, disputing with Stephen,
050610 and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking;
050611 then they suborned men, saying -- 'We have heard him speaking evil sayings in regard to Moses and God.'
050612 They did stir up also the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and having come upon [him], they caught him, and brought [him] to the sanhedrim;
050613 they set up also false witnesses, saying, 'This one doth not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the law,
050614 for we have heard him saying, That this Jesus the Nazarean shall overthrow this place, and shall change the customs that Moses delivered to us;'
050615 and gazing at him, all those sitting in the sanhedrim saw his face as it were the face of a messenger.
050701 And the chief priest said, 'Are then these things so?'
050702 and he said, 'Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: The God of the glory did appear to our father Abraham, being in Mesopotamia, before his dwelling in Haran,
050703 and He said to him, Go forth out of thy land, and out of thy kindred, and come to a land that I shall shew thee.
050704 'Then having come forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Haran, and from thence, after the death of his father, He did remove him to this land wherein ye now dwell,
050705 and He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a footstep, and did promise to give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him -- he having no child.
050706 'And God spake thus, That his seed shall be sojourning in a strange land, and they shall cause it to serve, and shall do it evil four hundred years,
050707 and the nation whom they shall serve I will judge, said God; and after these things they shall come forth and shall do Me service in this place.
050708 'And He gave to him a covenant of circumcision, and so he begat Isaac, and did circumcise him on the eighth day, and Isaac [begat] Jacob, and Jacob -- the twelve patriarchs;
050709 and the patriarchs, having been moved with jealousy, sold Joseph to Egypt, and God was with him,
050710 and did deliver him out of all his tribulations, and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he did set him -- governor over Egypt and all his house.
050711 'And there came a dearth upon all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers were not finding sustenance,
050712 and Jacob having heard that there was corn in Egypt, sent forth our fathers a first time;
050713 and at the second time was Joseph made known to his brethren, and Joseph's kindred became manifest to Pharaoh,
050714 and Joseph having sent, did call for his father Jacob, and all his kindred -- with seventy and five souls --
050715 and Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, himself and our fathers,
050716 and they were carried over into Sychem, and were laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in money from the sons of Emmor, of Sychem.
050717 'And according as the time of the promise was drawing nigh, which God did swear to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,
050718 till another king rose, who had not known Joseph;
050719 this one, having dealt subtilely with our kindred, did evil to our fathers, causing to expose their babes, that they might not live;
050720 in which time Moses was born, and he was fair to God, and he was brought up three months in the house of his father;
050721 and he having been exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up, and did rear him to herself for a son;
050722 and Moses was taught in all wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in words and in works.
050723 'And when forty years were fulfilled to him, it came upon his heart to look after his brethren, the sons of Israel;
050724 and having seen a certain one suffering injustice, he did defend, and did justice to the oppressed, having smitten the Egyptian;
050725 and he was supposing his brethren to understand that God through his hand doth give salvation; and they did not understand.
050726 'On the succeeding day, also, he shewed himself to them as they are striving, and urged them to peace, saying, Men, brethren are ye, wherefore do ye injustice to one another?
050727 and he who is doing injustice to the neighbour, did thrust him away, saying, Who set thee a ruler and a judge over us?
050728 to kill me dost thou wish, as thou didst kill yesterday the Egyptian?
050729 'And Moses fled at this word, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons,
050730 and forty years having been fulfilled, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai a messenger of the Lord, in a flame of fire of a bush,
050731 and Moses having seen did wonder at the sight; and he drawing near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord unto him,
050732 I [am] the God of thy fathers; the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. 'And Moses having become terrified, durst not behold,
050733 and the Lord said to him, Loose the sandal of thy feet, for the place in which thou hast stood is holy ground;
050734 seeing I have seen the affliction of My people that [is] in Egypt, and their groaning I did hear, and came down to deliver them; and now come, I will send thee to Egypt.
050735 'This Moses, whom they did refuse, saying, Who did set thee a ruler and a judge? this one God a ruler and a redeemer did send, in the hand of a messenger who appeared to him in the bush;
050736 this one did bring them forth, having done wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years;
050737 this is the Moses who did say to the sons of Israel: A prophet to you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your brethren, like to me, him shall ye hear.
050738 'This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the messenger who is speaking to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers who did receive the living oracles to give to us;
050739 to whom our fathers did not wish to become obedient, but did thrust away, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,
050740 saying to Aaron, Make to us gods who shall go on before us, for this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, we have not known what hath happened to him.
050741 'And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands,
050742 and God did turn, and did give them up to do service to the host of the heaven, according as it hath been written in the scroll of the prophets: Slain beasts and sacrifices did ye offer to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
050743 and ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan -- the figures that ye made to bow before them, and I will remove your dwelling beyond Babylon.
050744 'The tabernacle of the testimony was among our fathers in the wilderness, according as He did direct, who is speaking to Moses, to make it according to the figure that he had seen;
050745 which also our fathers having in succession received, did bring in with Joshua, into the possession of the nations whom God did drive out from the presence of our fathers, till the days of David,
050746 who found favour before God, and requested to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob;
050747 and Solomon built Him an house.
050748 'But the Most High in sanctuaries made with hands doth not dwell, according as the prophet saith:
050749 The heaven [is] My throne, and the earth My footstool; what house will ye build to Me? saith the Lord, or what [is] the place of My rest?
050750 hath not My hand made all these things?
050751 'Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and in ears! ye do always the Holy Spirit resist; as your fathers -- also ye;
050752 which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed those who declared before about the coming of the Righteous One, of whom now ye betrayers and murderers have become,
050753 who received the law by arrangement of messengers, and did not keep [it].'
050754 And hearing these things, they were cut to the hearts, and did gnash the teeth at him;
050755 and being full of the Holy Spirit, having looked stedfastly to the heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
050756 and he said, 'Lo, I see the heavens having been opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God.'
050757 And they, having cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and did rush with one accord upon him,
050758 and having cast him forth outside of the city, they were stoning [him] -- and the witnesses did put down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul --
050759 and they were stoning Stephen, calling and saying, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit;'
050760 and having bowed the knees, he cried with a loud voice, 'Lord, mayest thou not lay to them this sin;' and this having said, he fell asleep.
050801 And Saul was assenting to his death, and there came in that day a great persecution upon the assembly in Jerusalem, all also were scattered abroad in the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles;
050802 and devout men carried away Stephen, and made great lamentation over him;
050803 and Saul was making havoc of the assembly, into every house entering, and haling men and women, was giving them up to prison;
050804 they then indeed, having been scattered, went abroad proclaiming good news -- the word.
050805 And Philip having gone down to a city of Samaria, was preaching to them the Christ,
050806 the multitudes also were giving heed to the things spoken by Philip, with one accord, in their hearing and seeing the signs that he was doing,
050807 for unclean spirits came forth from many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice, and many who have been paralytic and lame were healed,
050808 and there was great joy in that city.
050809 And a certain man, by name Simon, was before in the city using magic, and amazing the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be a certain great one,
050810 to whom they were all giving heed, from small unto great, saying, 'This one is the great power of God;'
050811 and they were giving heed to him, because of his having for a long time amazed them with deeds of magic.
050812 And when they believed Philip, proclaiming good news, the things concerning the reign of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women;
050813 and Simon also himself did believe, and, having been baptized, he was continuing with Philip, beholding also signs and mighty acts being done, he was amazed.
050814 And the apostles in Jerusalem having heard that Samaria hath received the word of God, did send unto them Peter and John,
050815 who having come down did pray concerning them, that they may receive the Holy Spirit, --
050816 for as yet he was fallen upon none of them, and only they have been baptized -- to the name of the Lord Jesus;
050817 then were they laying hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
050818 And Simon, having beheld that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Spirit is given, brought before them money,
050819 saying, 'Give also to me this authority, that on whomsoever I may lay the hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.'
050820 And Peter said unto him, 'Thy silver with thee -- may it be to destruction! because the gift of God thou didst think to possess through money;
050821 thou hast neither part nor lot in this thing, for thy heart is not right before God;
050822 reform, therefore, from this thy wickedness, and beseech God, if then the purpose of thy heart may be forgiven thee,
050823 for in the gall of bitterness, and bond of unrighteousness, I perceive thee being.'
050824 And Simon answering, said, 'Beseech ye for me unto the Lord, that nothing may come upon me of the things ye have spoken.'
050825 They indeed, therefore, having testified fully, and spoken the word of the Lord, did turn back to Jerusalem; in many villages also of the Samaritans they did proclaim good news.
050826 And a messenger of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, 'Arise, and go on toward the south, on the way that is going down from Jerusalem to Gaza,' -- this is desert.
050827 And having arisen, he went on, and lo, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, a man of rank, of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to worship to Jerusalem;
050828 he was also returning, and is sitting on his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
050829 And the Spirit said to Philip, 'Go near, and be joined to this chariot;'
050830 and Philip having run near, heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, 'Dost thou then know what thou dost read?'
050831 and he said, 'Why, how am I able, if some one may not guide me?' he called Philip also, having come up, to sit with him.
050832 And the contents of the Writing that he was reading was this: 'As a sheep unto slaughter he was led, and as a lamb before his shearer dumb, so he doth not open his mouth;
050833 in his humiliation his judgment was taken away, and his generation -- who shall declare? because taken from the earth is his life.'
050834 And the eunuch answering Philip said, 'I pray thee, about whom doth the prophet say this? about himself, or about some other one?'
050835 and Philip having opened his mouth, and having begun from this Writing, proclaimed good news to him -- Jesus.
050836 And as they were going on the way, they came upon a certain water, and the eunuch said, 'Lo, water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?'
050837 [And Philip said, 'If thou dost believe out of all the heart, it is lawful;' and he answering said, 'I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God;']
050838 and he commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down to the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him;
050839 and when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more, for he was going on his way rejoicing;
050840 and Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through, he was proclaiming good news to all the cities, till his coming to Cesarea.
050901 And Saul, yet breathing of threatening and slaughter to the disciples of the Lord, having gone to the chief priest,
050902 did ask from him letters to Damascus, unto the synagogues, that if he may find any being of the way, both men and women, he may bring them bound to Jerusalem.
050903 And in the going, he came nigh to Damascus, and suddenly there shone round about him a light from the heaven,
050904 and having fallen upon the earth, he heard a voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why me dost thou persecute?'
050905 And he said, 'Who art thou, Lord?' and the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute; hard for thee at the pricks to kick;'
050906 trembling also, and astonished, he said, 'Lord, what dost thou wish me to do?' and the Lord [said] unto him, 'Arise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what it behoveth thee to do.'
050907 And the men who are journeying with him stood speechless, hearing indeed the voice but seeing no one,
050908 and Saul arose from the earth, and his eyes having been opened, he beheld no one, and leading him by the hand they brought him to Damascus,
050909 and he was three days without seeing, and he did neither eat nor drink.
050910 And there was a certain disciple in Damascus, by name Ananias, and the Lord said unto him in a vision, 'Ananias;' and he said, 'Behold me, Lord;'
050911 and the Lord [saith] unto him, 'Having risen, go on unto the street that is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas, [one] by name Saul of Tarsus, for, lo, he doth pray,
050912 and he saw in a vision a man, by name Ananias, coming in, and putting a hand on him, that he may see again.'
050913 And Ananias answered, 'Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many evils he did to Thy saints in Jerusalem,
050914 and here he hath authority from the chief priests, to bind all those calling on Thy name.'
050915 And the Lord said unto him, 'Be going on, because a choice vessel to Me is this one, to bear My name before nations and kings -- the sons also of Israel;
050916 for I will shew him how many things it behoveth him for My name to suffer.'
050917 And Ananias went away, and did enter into the house, and having put upon him [his] hands, said, 'Saul, brother, the Lord hath sent me -- Jesus who did appear to thee in the way in which thou wast coming -- that thou mayest see again, and mayest be filled with the Holy Spirit.'
050918 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales, he saw again also presently, and having risen, was baptized,
050919 and having received nourishment, was strengthened, and Saul was with the disciples in Damascus certain days,
050920 and immediately in the synagogues he was preaching the Christ, that he is the Son of God.
050921 And all those hearing were amazed, and said, 'Is not this he who laid waist in Jerusalem those calling on this name, and hither to this intent had come, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?'
050922 And Saul was still more strengthened, and he was confounding the Jews dwelling in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
050923 And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him,
050924 and their counsel against [him] was known to Saul; they were also watching the gates both day and night, that they may kill him,
050925 and the disciples having taken him, by night did let him down by the wall, letting down in a basket.
050926 And Saul, having come to Jerusalem, did try to join himself to the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple,
050927 and Barnabas having taken him, brought [him] unto the apostles, and did declare to them how in the way he saw the Lord, and that he spake to him, and how in Damascus he was speaking boldly in the name of Jesus.
050928 And he was with them, coming in and going out in Jerusalem,
050929 and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, he was both speaking and disputing with the Hellenists, and they were taking in hand to kill him,
050930 and the brethren having known, brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
050931 Then, indeed, the assemblies throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had peace, being built up, and, going on in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.
050932 And it came to pass that Peter passing throughout all [quarters], came down also unto the saints who were dwelling at Lydda,
050933 and he found there a certain man, Aeneas by name -- for eight years laid upon a couch -- who was paralytic,
050934 and Peter said to him, 'Aeneas, heal thee doth Jesus the Christ; arise and spread for thyself;' and immediately he rose,
050935 and all those dwelling at Lydda, and Saron saw him, and did turn to the Lord.
050936 And in Joppa there was a certain female disciple, by name Tabitha, (which interpreted, is called Dorcas,) this woman was full of good works and kind acts that she was doing;
050937 and it came to pass in those days she, having ailed, died, and having bathed her, they laid her in an upper chamber,
050938 and Lydda being nigh to Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter is in that [place], sent two men unto him, calling on him not to delay to come through unto them.
050939 And Peter having risen, went with them, whom having come, they brought into the upper chamber, and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing coats and garments, as many as Dorcas was making while she was with them.
050940 And Peter having put them all forth without, having bowed the knees, did pray, and having turned unto the body said, 'Tabitha, arise;' and she opened her eyes, and having seen Peter, she sat up,
050941 and having given her [his] hand, he lifted her up, and having called the saints and the widows, he presented her alive,
050942 and it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord;
050943 and it came to pass, that he remained many days in Joppa, with a certain one, Simon a tanner.
051001 And there was a certain man in Cesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion from a band called Italian,
051002 pious, and fearing God with all his house, doing also many kind acts to the people, and beseeching God always,
051003 he saw in a vision manifestly, as it were the ninth hour of the day, a messenger of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, 'Cornelius;'
051004 and he having looked earnestly on him, and becoming afraid, said, 'What is it, Lord?' And he said to him, 'Thy prayers and thy kind acts came up for a memorial before God,
051005 and now send men to Joppa, and send for a certain one Simon, who is surnamed Peter,
051006 this one doth lodge with a certain Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea; this one shall speak to thee what it behoveth thee to do.'
051007 And when the messenger who is speaking to Cornelius went away, having called two of his domestics, and a pious soldier of those waiting on him continually,
051008 and having declared to them all things, he sent them to Joppa.
051009 And on the morrow, as these are proceeding on the way, and are drawing nigh to the city, Peter went up upon the house-top to pray, about the sixth hour,
051010 and he became very hungry, and wished to eat; and they making ready, there fell upon him a trance,
051011 and he doth behold the heaven opened, and descending unto him a certain vessel, as a great sheet, bound at the four corners, and let down upon the earth,
051012 in which were all the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the heaven,
051013 and there came a voice unto him: 'Having risen, Peter, slay and eat.'
051014 And Peter said, 'Not so, Lord; because at no time did I eat anything common or unclean;'
051015 and [there is] a voice again a second time unto him: 'What God did cleanse, thou, declare not thou common;'
051016 and this was done thrice, and again was the vessel received up to the heaven.
051017 And as Peter was perplexed in himself what the vision that he saw might be, then, lo, the men who have been sent from Cornelius, having made inquiry for the house of Simon, stood at the gate,
051018 and having called, they were asking if Simon, who is surnamed Peter, doth lodge here?
051019 And Peter thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, 'Lo, three men do seek thee;
051020 but having risen, go down and go on with them, nothing doubting, because I have sent them;'
051021 and Peter having come down unto the men who have been sent from Cornelius unto him, said, 'Lo, I am he whom ye seek, what [is] the cause for which ye are present?'
051022 And they said, 'Cornelius, a centurion, a man righteous and fearing God, well testified to, also, by all the nation of the Jews, was divinely warned by a holy messenger to send for thee, to his house, and to hear sayings from thee.'
051023 Having called them in, therefore, he lodged them, and on the morrow Peter went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa went with him,
051024 and on the morrow they did enter into Cesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kindred and near friends,
051025 and as it came that Peter entered in, Cornelius having met him, having fallen at [his] feet, did bow before [him];
051026 and Peter raised him, saying, 'Stand up; I also myself am a man;'
051027 and talking with him he went in, and doth find many having come together.
051028 And he said unto them, 'Ye know how it is unlawful for a man, a Jew, to keep company with, or to come unto, one of another race, but to me God did shew to call no man common or unclean;
051029 therefore also without gainsaying I came, having been sent for; I ask, therefore, for what matter ye did send for me?'
051030 And Cornelius said, 'Four days ago till this hour, I was fasting, and [at] the ninth hour praying in my house, and, lo, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
051031 and he said, Cornelius, thy prayer was heard, and thy kind acts were remembered before God;
051032 send, therefore, to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; this one doth lodge in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea, who having come, shall speak to thee;
051033 at once, therefore, I sent to thee; thou also didst do well, having come; now, therefore, are we all before God present to hear all things that have been commanded thee by God.'
051034 And Peter having opened his mouth, said, 'Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons,
051035 but in every nation he who is fearing Him, and is working righteousness, is acceptable to Him;
051036 the word that he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming good news -- peace through Jesus Christ (this one is Lord of all,)
051037 ye -- ye have known; -- the word that came throughout all Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the baptism that John preached;
051038 Jesus who [is] from Nazareth -- how God did anoint him with the Holy Spirit and power; who went through, doing good, and healing all those oppressed by the devil, because God was with him;
051039 and we -- we are witnesses of all things that he did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, -- whom they did slay, having hanged upon a tree.
051040 'This one God did raise up the third day, and gave him to become manifest,
051041 not to all the people, but to witnesses, to those having been chosen before by God -- to us who did eat with [him], and did drink with him, after his rising out of the dead;
051042 and he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify fully that it is he who hath been ordained by God judge of living and dead --
051043 to this one do all the prophets testify, that through his name every one that is believing in him doth receive remission of sins.'
051044 While Peter is yet speaking these sayings, the Holy spirit fell upon all those hearing the word,
051045 and those of the circumcision believing were astonished -- as many as came with Peter -- because also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit hath been poured out,
051046 for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and magnifying God.
051047 Then answered Peter, 'The water is any one able to forbid, that these may not be baptized, who the Holy Spirit did receive -- even as also we?'
051048 he commanded them also to be baptized in the name of the Lord; then they besought him to remain certain days.
051101 And the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard that also the nations did receive the word of God,
051102 and when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision were contending with him,
051103 saying -- 'Unto men uncircumcised thou didst go in, and didst eat with them!'
051104 And Peter having begun, did expound to them in order saying,
051105 'I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance a vision, a certain vessel coming down, as a great sheet by four corners being let down out of the heaven, and it came unto me;
051106 at which having looked stedfastly, I was considering, and I saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of heaven;
051107 and I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, slay and eat;
051108 and I said, Not so, Lord; because anything common or unclean hath at no time entered into my mouth;
051109 and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven, What God did cleanse, thou -- declare not thou common.
051110 'And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to the heaven,
051111 and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in which I was, having been sent from Cesarea unto me,
051112 and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did enter into the house of the man,
051113 he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,
051114 who shall speak sayings by which thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.
051115 'And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning,
051116 and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John indeed did baptize with water, and ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit;
051117 if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us, having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I -- how was I able to withstand God?'
051118 And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were glorifying God, saying, 'Then, indeed, also to the nations did God give the reformation to life.'
051119 Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad, from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except to Jews only;
051120 and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the Hellenists, proclaiming good news -- the Lord Jesus,
051121 and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord.
051122 And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that [is] in Jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth Barnabas to go through unto Antioch,
051123 who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord,
051124 because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord.
051125 And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul,
051126 and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.
051127 And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to Antioch,
051128 and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be throughout all the world -- which also came to pass in the time of Claudius Caesar --
051129 and the disciples, according as any one was prospering, determined each of them to send for ministration to the brethren dwelling in Judea,
051130 which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
051201 And about that time, Herod the king put forth his hands, to do evil to certain of those of the assembly,
051202 and he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword,
051203 and having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews, he added to lay hold of Peter also -- and they were the days of the unleavened food --
051204 whom also having seized, he did put in prison, having delivered [him] to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people.
051205 Peter, therefore, indeed, was kept in the prison, and fervent prayer was being made by the assembly unto God for him,
051206 and when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night was Peter sleeping between two soldiers, having been bound with two chains, guards also before the door were keeping the prison,
051207 and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood by, and a light shone in the buildings, and having smitten Peter on the side, he raised him up, saying, 'Rise in haste,' and his chains fell from off [his] hands.
051208 The messenger also said to him, 'Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals;' and he did so; and he saith to him, 'Put thy garment round and be following me;'
051209 and having gone forth, he was following him, and he knew not that it is true that which is done through the messenger, and was thinking he saw a vision,
051210 and having passed through a first ward, and a second, they came unto the iron gate that is leading to the city, which of its own accord did open to them, and having gone forth, they went on through one street, and immediately the messenger departed from him.
051211 And Peter having come to himself, said, 'Now I have known of a truth that the Lord did sent forth His messenger, and did deliver me out of the hand of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews;'
051212 also, having considered, he came unto the house of Mary, the mother of John, who is surnamed Mark, where there were many thronged together and praying.
051213 And Peter having knocked at the door of the porch, there came a damsel to hearken, by name Rhoda,
051214 and having known the voice of Peter, from the joy she did not open the porch, but having run in, told of the standing of Peter before the porch,
051215 and they said unto her, 'Thou art mad;' and she was confidently affirming [it] to be so, and they said, 'It is his messenger;'
051216 and Peter was continuing knocking, and having opened, they saw him, and were astonished,
051217 and having beckoned to them with the hand to be silent, he declared to them how the Lord brought him out of the prison, and he said, 'Declare to James and to the brethren these things;' and having gone forth, he went on to another place.
051218 And day having come, there was not a little stir among the soldiers what then was become of Peter,
051219 and Herod having sought for him, and not having found, having examined the guards, did command [them] to be led away to punishment, and having gone down from Judea to Cesarea, he was abiding [there].
051220 And Herod was highly displeased with the Tyrians and Sidonians, and with one accord they came unto him, and having made a friend of Blastus, who [is] over the bed-chambers of the king, they were asking peace, because of their country being nourished from the king's;
051221 and on a set day, Herod having arrayed himself in kingly apparel, and having sat down upon the tribunal, was making an oration unto them,
051222 and the populace were shouting, 'The voice of a god, and not of a man;'
051223 and presently there smote him a messenger of the Lord, because he did not give the glory to God, and having been eaten of worms, he expired.
051224 And the word of God did grow and did multiply,
051225 and Barnabas and Saul did turn back out of Jerusalem, having fulfilled the ministration, having taken also with [them] John, who was surnamed Mark.
051301 And there were certain in Antioch, in the assembly there, prophets and teachers; both Barnabas, and Simeon who is called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen also -- Herod the tetrarch's foster-brother -- and Saul;
051302 and in their ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Separate ye to me both Barnabas and Saul to the work to which I have called them,'
051303 then having fasted, and having prayed, and having laid the hands on them, they sent [them] away.
051304 These, indeed, then, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, thence also they sailed to Cyprus,
051305 and having come unto Salamis, they declared the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they had also John [as] a ministrant;
051306 and having gone through the island unto Paphos, they found a certain magian, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name [is] Bar-Jesus;
051307 who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man; this one having called for Barnabas and Saul, did desire to hear the word of God,
051308 and there withstood them Elymas the magian -- for so is his name interpreted -- seeking to pervert the proconsul from the faith.
051309 And Saul -- who also [is] Paul -- having been filled with the Holy Spirit, and having looked stedfastly on him,
051310 said, 'O full of all guile, and all profligacy, son of a devil, enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease perverting the right ways of the Lord?
051311 and now, lo, a hand of the Lord [is] upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season;' and presently there fell upon him a mist and darkness, and he, going about, was seeking some to lead [him] by the hand;
051312 then the proconsul having seen what hath come to pass, did believe, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
051313 And those about Paul having set sail from Paphos, came to Perga of Pamphylia, and John having departed from them, did turn back to Jerusalem,
051314 and they having gone through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia, and having gone into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, they sat down,
051315 and after the reading of the law and of the prophets, the chief men of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, 'Men, brethren, if there be a word in you of exhortation unto the people -- say on.'
051316 And Paul having risen, and having beckoned with the hand, said, 'Men, Israelites, and those fearing God, hearken:
051317 the God of this people Israel did choose our fathers, and the people He did exalt in their sojourning in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm did He bring them out of it;
051318 and about a period of forty years He did suffer their manners in the wilderness,
051319 and having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He did divide by lot to them their land.
051320 'And after these things, about four hundred and fifty years, He gave judges -- till Samuel the prophet;
051321 and thereafter they asked for a king, and God did give to them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years;
051322 and having removed him, He did raise up to them David for king, to whom also having testified, he said, I found David, the [son] of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who shall do all My will.
051323 'Of this one's seed God, according to promise, did raise to Israel a Saviour -- Jesus,
051324 John having first preached, before his coming, a baptism of reformation to all the people of Israel;
051325 and as John was fulfilling the course, he said, Whom me do ye suppose to be? I am not [he], but, lo, he doth come after me, of whom I am not worthy to loose the sandal of [his] feet.
051326 'Men, brethren, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you fearing God, to you was the word of this salvation sent,
051327 for those dwelling in Jerusalem, and their chiefs, this one not having known, also the voices of the prophets, which every sabbath are being read -- having judged [him] -- did fulfill,
051328 and no cause of death having found, they did ask of Pilate that he should be slain,
051329 and when they did complete all the things written about him, having taken [him] down from the tree, they laid him in a tomb;
051330 and God did raise him out of the dead,
051331 and he was seen for many days of those who did come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
051332 'And we to you do proclaim good news -- that the promise made unto the fathers,
051333 God hath in full completed this to us their children, having raised up Jesus, as also in the second Psalm it hath been written, My Son thou art -- I to-day have begotten thee.
051334 'And that He did raise him up out of the dead, no more to return to corruption, he hath said thus -- I will give to you the faithful kindnesses of David;
051335 wherefore also in another [place] he saith, Thou shalt not give Thy kind One to see corruption,
051336 for David, indeed, his own generation having served by the will of God, did fall asleep, and was added unto his fathers, and saw corruption,
051337 but he whom God did raise up, did not see corruption.
051338 'Let it therefore be known to you, men, brethren, that through this one to you is the forgiveness of sins declared,
051339 and from all things from which ye were not able in the law of Moses to be declared righteous, in this one every one who is believing is declared righteous;
051340 see, therefore, it may not come upon you that hath been spoken in the prophets:
051341 See, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish, because a work I -- I do work in your days, a work in which ye may not believe, though any one may declare [it] to you.'
051342 And having gone forth out of the synagogue of the Jews, the nations were calling upon [them] that on the next sabbath these sayings may be spoken to them,
051343 and the synagogue having been dismissed, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes did follow Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were persuading them to remain in the grace of God.
051344 And on the coming sabbath, almost all the city was gathered together to hear the word of God,
051345 and the Jews having seen the multitudes, were filled with zeal, and did contradict the things spoken by Paul -- contradicting and speaking evil.
051346 And speaking boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, 'To you it was necessary that first the word of God be spoken, and seeing ye do thrust it away, and do not judge yourselves worthy of the life age-during, lo, we do turn to the nations;
051347 for so hath the Lord commanded us: I have set thee for a light of nations -- for thy being for salvation unto the end of the earth.'
051348 And the nations hearing were glad, and were glorifying the word of the Lord, and did believe -- as many as were appointed to life age-during;
051349 and the word of the Lord was spread abroad through all the region.
051350 And the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the first men of the city, and did raise persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and did put them out from their borders;
051351 and they having shaken off the dust of their feet against them, came to Iconium,
051352 and the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
051401 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they did enter together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spake, so that there believed both of Jews and Greeks a great multitude;
051402 and the unbelieving Jews did stir up and made evil the souls of the nations against the brethren;
051403 long time, indeed, therefore, did they abide speaking boldly in the Lord, who is testifying to the word of His grace, and granting signs and wonders to come to pass through their hands.
051404 And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles,
051405 and when there was a purpose both of the nations and of the Jews with their rulers to use [them] despitefully, and to stone them,
051406 they having become aware, did flee to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about,
051407 and there they were proclaiming good news.
051408 And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in the feet, was sitting, being lame from the womb of his mother -- who never had walked,
051409 this one was hearing Paul speaking, who, having stedfastly beheld him, and having seen that he hath faith to be saved,
051410 said with a loud voice, 'Stand up on thy feet upright;' and he was springing and walking,
051411 and the multitudes having seen what Paul did, did lift up their voice, in the speech of Lycaonia, saying, 'The gods, having become like men, did come down unto us;'
051412 they were calling also Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, since he was the leader in speaking.
051413 And the priest of the Zeus that is before their city, oxen and garlands unto the porches having brought, with the multitudes did wish to sacrifice,
051414 and having heard, the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having rent their garments, did spring into the multitude, crying
051415 and saying, 'Men, why these things do ye? and we are men like-affected with you, proclaiming good news to you, from these vanities to turn unto the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in them;
051416 who in the past generations did suffer all the nations to go on in their ways,
051417 though, indeed, without witness He did not leave himself, doing good -- from heaven giving rains to us, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness;'
051418 and these things saying, scarcely did they restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.
051419 And there came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, and they having persuaded the multitudes, and having stoned Paul, drew him outside of the city, having supposed him to be dead;
051420 and the disciples having surrounded him, having risen he entered into the city, and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe.
051421 Having proclaimed good news also to that city, and having discipled many, they turned back to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,
051422 confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting to remain in the faith, and that through many tribulations it behoveth us to enter into the reign of God,
051423 and having appointed to them by vote elders in every assembly, having prayed with fastings, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
051424 And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia,
051425 and having spoken in Perga the word, they went down to Attalia,
051426 and thence did sail to Antioch, whence they had been given by the grace of God for the work that they fulfilled;
051427 and having come and gathered together the assembly, they declared as many things as God did with them, and that He did open to the nations a door of faith;
051428 and they abode there not a little time with the disciples.
051501 And certain having come down from Judea, were teaching the brethren -- 'If ye be not circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye are not able to be saved;'
051502 there having been, therefore, not a little dissension and disputation to Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, to go up unto the apostles and elders to Jerusalem about this question,
051503 they indeed, then, having been sent forward by the assembly, were passing through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the nations, and they were causing great joy to all the brethren.
051504 And having come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly, and the apostles, and the elders, they declared also as many things as God did with them;
051505 and there rose up certain of those of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying -- 'It behoveth to circumcise them, to command them also to keep the law of Moses.'
051506 And there were gathered together the apostles and the elders, to see about this matter,
051507 and there having been much disputing, Peter having risen up said unto them, 'Men, brethren, ye know that from former days, God among us did make choice, through my mouth, for the nations to hear the word of the good news, and to believe;
051508 and the heart-knowing God did bare them testimony, having given to them the Holy Spirit, even as also to us,
051509 and did put no difference also between us and them, by the faith having purified their hearts;
051510 now, therefore, why do ye tempt God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
051511 but, through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, even as also they.'
051512 And all the multitude did keep silence, and were hearkening to Barnabas and Paul, declaring as many signs and wonders as God did among the nations through them;
051513 and after they are silent, James answered, saying, 'Men, brethren, hearken to me;
051514 Simeon did declare how at first God did look after to take out of the nations a people for His name,
051515 and to this agree the words of the prophets, as it hath been written:
051516 After these things I will turn back, and I will build again the tabernacle of David, that is fallen down, and its ruins I will build again, and will set it upright --
051517 that the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the nations, upon whom My name hath been called, saith the Lord, who is doing all these things.
051518 'Known from the ages to God are all His works;
051519 wherefore I judge: not to trouble those who from the nations do turn back to God,
051520 but to write to them to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and the whoredom, and the strangled thing; and the blood;
051521 for Moses from former generations in every city hath those preaching him -- in the synagogues every sabbath being read.'
051522 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, chosen men out of themselves to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas -- Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren --
051523 having written through their hand thus: 'The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to those in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brethren, who [are] of the nations, greeting;
051524 seeing we have heard that certain having gone forth from us did trouble you with words, subverting your souls, saying to be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we did give no charge,
051525 it seemed good to us, having come together with one accord, chosen men to send unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul --
051526 men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ --
051527 we have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, and they by word are telling the same things.
051528 'For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, no more burden to lay upon you, except these necessary things:
051529 to abstain from things offered to idols, and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom; from which keeping yourselves, ye shall do well; be strong!'
051530 They then, indeed, having been let go, went to Antioch, and having brought the multitude together, did deliver the epistle,
051531 and they having read, did rejoice for the consolation;
051532 Judas also and Silas, being themselves also prophets, through much discourse did exhort the brethren, and confirm,
051533 and having passed some time, they were let go with peace from the brethren unto the apostles;
051534 and it seemed good to Silas to remain there still.
051535 And Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming good news -- with many others also -- the word of the Lord;
051536 and after certain days, Paul said unto Barnabas, 'Having turned back again, we may look after our brethren, in every city in which we have preached the word of the Lord -- how they are.'
051537 And Barnabas counseled to take with [them] John called Mark,
051538 and Paul was not thinking it good to take him with them who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work;
051539 there came, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they were parted from one another, and Barnabas having taken Mark, did sail to Cyprus,
051540 and Paul having chosen Silas, went forth, having been given up to the grace of God by the brethren;
051541 and he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies.
051601 And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek,
051602 who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium;
051603 this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having taken [him], he circumcised him, because of the Jews who are in those places, for they all knew his father -- that he was a Greek.
051604 And as they were going on through the cities, they were delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged by the apostles and the elders who [are] in Jerusalem,
051605 then, indeed, were the assemblies established in the faith, and were abounding in number every day;
051606 and having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,
051607 having gone toward Mysia, they were trying to go on toward Bithynia, and the Spirit did not suffer them,
051608 and having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
051609 And a vision through the night appeared to Paul -- a certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and saying, 'Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;' --
051610 and when he saw the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go forth to Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord hath called us to preach good news to them,
051611 having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to Neapolis,
051612 thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the part of Macedonia -- a colony. And we were in this city abiding certain days,
051613 on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city, by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together,
051614 and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by Paul;
051615 and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call upon us, saying, 'If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having entered into my house, remain;' and she constrained us.
051616 And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying,
051617 she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, 'These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;'
051618 and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, 'I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;' and it came forth the same hour.
051619 And her masters having seen that the hope of their employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew [them] to the market-place, unto the rulers,
051620 and having brought them to the magistrates, they said, 'These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;
051621 and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.'
051622 And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates having torn their garments from them, were commanding to beat [them] with rods,
051623 many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,
051624 who such a charge having received, did put them to the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.
051625 And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,
051626 and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently were all the doors, and of all -- the bands were loosed;
051627 and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,
051628 and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'Thou mayest not do thyself any harm, for we are all here.'
051629 And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas,
051630 and having brought them forth, said, 'Sirs, what must I do -- that I may be saved?'
051631 and they said, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved -- thou and thy house;'
051632 and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all those in his household;
051633 and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did bathe [them] from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all his presently,
051634 having brought them also into his house, he set food before [them], and was glad with all the household, he having believed in God.
051635 And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers, saying, 'Let those men go;'
051636 and the jailor told these words unto Paul -- 'The magistrates have sent, that ye may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;'
051637 and Paul said to them, 'Having beaten us publicly uncondemned -- men, Romans being -- they did cast [us] to prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but having come themselves, let them bring us forth.'
051638 And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings, and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,
051639 and having come, they besought them, and having brought [them] forth, they were asking [them] to go forth from the city;
051640 and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered into [the house of] Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth.
051701 And having passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews,
051702 and according to the custom of Paul, he went in unto them, and for three sabbaths he was reasoning with them from the Writings,
051703 opening and alleging, 'That the Christ it behoved to suffer, and to rise again out of the dead, and that this is the Christ -- Jesus whom I proclaim to you.'
051704 And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, of the principal women also not a few.
051705 And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to bring [them] to the populace,
051706 and not having found them, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the city rulers, calling aloud -- 'These, having put the world in commotion, are also here present,
051707 whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying another to be king -- Jesus.'
051708 And they troubled the multitude and the city rulers, hearing these things,
051709 and having taking security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
051710 And the brethren immediately, through the night, sent forth both Paul and Silas to Berea, who having come, went to the synagogue of the Jews;
051711 and these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, they received the word with all readiness of mind, every day examining the Writings whether those things were so;
051712 many, indeed, therefore, of them did believe, and of the honourable Greek women and men not a few.
051713 And when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that also in Berea was the word of God declared by Paul, they came thither also, agitating the multitudes;
051714 and then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul, to go on as it were to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were remaining there.
051715 And those conducting Paul, brought him unto Athens, and having received a command unto Silas and Timotheus that with all speed they may come unto him, they departed;
051716 and Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, beholding the city wholly given to idolatry,
051717 therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the worshipping persons, and in the market-place every day with those who met with him.
051718 And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were saying, 'What would this seed picker wish to say?' and others, 'Of strange demons he doth seem to be an announcer;' because Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good news,
051719 having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought [him], saying, 'Are we able to know what [is] this new teaching that is spoken by thee,
051720 for certain strange things thou dost bring to our ears? we wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;'
051721 and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear some newer thing.
051722 And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus, said, 'Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as over-religious;
051723 for passing through and contemplating your objects of worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God -- unknown; whom, therefore -- not knowing -- ye do worship, this One I announce to you.
051724 'God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with hands doth not dwell,
051725 neither by the hands of men is He served -- needing anything, He giving to all life, and breath, and all things;
051726 He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell upon all the face of the earth -- having ordained times before appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings --
051727 to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and find, -- though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us,
051728 for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring.
051729 'Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of art and device of man;
051730 the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having overlooked, doth now command all men everywhere to reform,
051731 because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.'
051732 And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some, indeed, were mocking, but others said, 'We will hear thee again concerning this;'
051733 and so Paul went forth from the midst of them,
051734 and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among whom [is] also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman, by name Damaris, and others with them.
051801 And after these things, Paul having departed out of Athens, came to Corinth,
051802 and having found a certain Jew, by name Aquilas, of Pontus by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife -- because of Claudius having directed all the Jews to depart out of Rome -- he came to them,
051803 and because of being of the same craft, he did remain with them, and was working, for they were tent-makers as to craft;
051804 and he was reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.
051805 And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the Spirit, testifying fully to the Jews Jesus the Christ;
051806 and on their resisting and speaking evil, having shaken [his] garments, he said unto them, 'Your blood [is] upon your head -- I am clean; henceforth to the nations I will go on.'
051807 And having departed thence, he went to the house of a certain one, by name Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue,
051808 and Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue did believe in the Lord with all his house, and many of the Corinthians hearing were believing, and they were being baptized.
051809 And the Lord said through a vision in the night to Paul, 'Be not afraid, but be speaking and thou mayest be not silent;
051810 because I am with thee, and no one shall set on thee to do thee evil; because I have much people in this city;'
051811 and he continued a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.
051812 And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a rush with one accord upon Paul, and brought him unto the tribunal,
051813 saying -- 'Against the law this one doth persuade men to worship God;'
051814 and Paul being about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, 'If, indeed, then, it was anything unrighteous, or an act of wicked profligacy, O Jews, according to reason I had borne with you,
051815 but if it is a question concerning words and names, and of your law, look ye yourselves [to it], for a judge of these things I do not wish to be,'
051816 and he drave them from the tribunal;
051817 and all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, the chief man of the synagogue, were beating [him] before the tribunal, and not even for these things was Gallio caring.
051818 And Paul having remained yet a good many days, having taken leave of the brethren, was sailing to Syria -- and with him [are] Priscilla and Aquilas -- having shorn [his] head in Cenchera, for he had a vow;
051819 and he came down to Ephesus, and did leave them there, and he himself having entered into the synagogue did reason with the Jews:
051820 and they having requested [him] to remain a longer time with them, he did not consent,
051821 but took leave of them, saying, 'It behoveth me by all means the coming feast to keep at Jerusalem, and again I will return unto you -- God willing.' And he sailed from Ephesus,
051822 and having come down to Cesarea, having gone up, and having saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.
051823 And having made some stay he went forth, going through in order the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
051824 And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, a man of eloquence, being mighty in the Writings, came to Ephesus,
051825 this one was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in the Spirit, was speaking and teaching exactly the things about the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John;
051826 this one also began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Aquilas and Priscilla having heard of him, took him to [them], and did more exactly expound to him the way of God,
051827 and he being minded to go through into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples, having exhorted them to receive him, who having come, did help them much who have believed through the grace,
051828 for powerfully the Jews he was refuting publicly, shewing through the Writings Jesus to be the Christ.
051901 And it came to pass, in Apollos' being in Corinth, Paul having gone through the upper parts, came to Ephesus, and having found certain disciples,
051902 he said unto them, 'The Holy Spirit did ye receive -- having believed?' and they said unto him, 'But we did not even hear whether there is any Holy Spirit;'
051903 and he said unto them, 'To what, then, were ye baptized?' and they said, 'To John's baptism.'
051904 And Paul said, 'John, indeed, did baptize with a baptism of reformation, saying to the people that in him who is coming after him they should believe -- that is, in the Christ -- Jesus;'
051905 and they, having heard, were baptized -- to the name of the Lord Jesus,
051906 and Paul having laid on them [his] hands, the Holy Spirit came upon them, they were speaking also with tongues, and prophesying,
051907 and all the men were, as it were, twelve.
051908 And having gone into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the reign of God,
051909 and when certain were hardened and were disbelieving, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, having departed from them, he did separate the disciples, every day reasoning in the school of a certain Tyrannus.
051910 And this happened for two years so that all those dwelling in Asia did hear the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks,
051911 mighty works also -- not common -- was God working through the hands of Paul,
051912 so that even unto the ailing were brought from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the sicknesses departed from them; the evil spirits also went forth from them.
051913 And certain of the wandering exorcist Jews, took upon [them] to name over those having the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, 'We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul doth preach;'
051914 and there were certain -- seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest -- who are doing this thing;
051915 and the evil spirit, answering, said, 'Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; and ye -- who are ye?'
051916 And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaping upon them, and having overcome them, prevailed against them, so that naked and wounded they did flee out of that house,
051917 and this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who are dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified,
051918 many also of those who did believe were coming, confessing and declaring their acts,
051919 and many of those who had practised the curious arts, having brought the books together, were burning [them] before all; and they reckoned together the prices of them, and found [it] five myriads of silverlings;
051920 so powerfully was the word of God increasing and prevailing.
051921 And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in the Spirit, having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, to go on to Jerusalem, saying -- 'After my being there, it behoveth me also to see Rome;'
051922 and having sent to Macedonia two of those ministering to him -- Timotheus and Erastus -- he himself stayed a time in Asia.
051923 And there came, at that time, not a little stir about the way,
051924 for a certain one, Demetrius by name, a worker in silver, making silver sanctuaries of Artemis, was bringing to the artificers gain not a little,
051925 whom, having brought in a crowd together, and those who did work about such things, he said, 'Men, ye know that by this work we have our wealth;
051926 and ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all Asia, this Paul, having persuaded, did turn away a great multitude, saying, that they are not gods who are made by hands;
051927 and not only is this department in danger for us of coming into disregard, but also, that of the great goddess Artemis the temple is to be reckoned for nothing, and also her greatness is about to be brought down, whom all Asia and the world doth worship.'
051928 And they having heard, and having become full of wrath, were crying out, saying, 'Great [is] the Artemis of the Ephesians!'
051929 and the whole city was filled with confusion, they rushed also with one accord into the theatre, having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's fellow-travellers.
051930 And on Paul's purposing to enter in unto the populace, the disciples were not suffering him,
051931 and certain also of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, having sent unto him, were entreating him not to venture himself into the theatre.
051932 Some indeed, therefore, were calling out one thing, and some another, for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together;
051933 and out of the multitude they put forward Alexander -- the Jews thrusting him forward -- and Alexander having beckoned with the hand, wished to make defence to the populace,
051934 and having known that he is a Jew, one voice came out of all, for about two hours, crying, 'Great [is] the Artemis of the Ephesians!'
051935 And the public clerk having quieted the multitude, saith, 'Men, Ephesians, why, who is the man that doth not know that the city of the Ephesians is a devotee of the great goddess Artemis, and of that which fell down from Zeus?
051936 these things, then, not being to be gainsaid, it is necessary for you to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
051937 'For ye brought these men, who are neither temple-robbers nor speaking evil of your goddess;
051938 if indeed, therefore, Demetrius and the artificers with him with any one have a matter, court [days] are held, and there are proconsuls; let them accuse one another.
051939 'And if ye seek after anything concerning other matters, in the legal assembly it shall be determined;
051940 for we are also in peril of being accused of insurrection in regard to this day, there being no occasion by which we shall be able to give an account of this concourse;'
051941 and these things having said, he dismissed the assembly.
052001 And after the ceasing of the tumult, Paul having called near the disciples, and having embraced [them], went forth to go on to Macedonia;
052002 and having gone through those parts, and having exhorted them with many words, he came to Greece;
052003 having made also three months' [stay] -- a counsel of the Jews having been against him -- being about to set forth to Syria, there came [to him] a resolution of returning through Macedonia.
052004 And there were accompanying him unto Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of Asiatics Tychicus and Trophimus;
052005 these, having gone before, did remain for us in Troas,
052006 and we sailed, after the days of the unleavened food, from Philippi, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.
052007 And on the first of the week, the disciples having been gathered together to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, about to depart on the morrow, he was also continuing the discourse till midnight,
052008 and there were many lamps in the upper chamber where they were gathered together,
052009 and there was sitting a certain youth, by name Eutychus, upon the window -- being borne down by a deep sleep, Paul discoursing long -- he having sunk down from the sleep, fell down from the third story, and was lifted up dead.
052010 And Paul, having gone down, fell upon him, and having embraced [him], said, 'Make no tumult, for his life is in him;'
052011 and having come up, and having broken bread, and having tasted, for a long time also having talked -- till daylight, so he went forth,
052012 and they brought up the lad alive, and were comforted in no ordinary measure.
052013 And we having gone before unto the ship, did sail to Assos, thence intending to take in Paul, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go on foot;
052014 and when he met with us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene,
052015 and thence having sailed, on the morrow we came over-against Chios, and the next day we arrived at Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, on the following day we came to Miletus,
052016 for Paul decided to sail past Ephesus, that there may not be to him a loss of time in Asia, for he hasted, if it were possible for him, on the day of the Pentecost to be at Jerusalem.
052017 And from Miletus, having sent to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the assembly,
052018 and when they were come unto him, he said to them, 'Ye -- ye know from the first day in which I came to Asia, how, with you at all times I was;
052019 serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, that befell me in the counsels of the Jews against [me];
052020 how nothing I did keep back of what things are profitable, not to declare to you, and to teach you publicly, and in every house,
052021 testifying fully both to Jews and Greeks, toward God reformation, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
052022 'And now, lo, I -- bound in the Spirit -- go on to Jerusalem, the things that shall befall me in it not knowing,
052023 save that the Holy Spirit in every city doth testify fully, saying, that for me bonds and tribulations remain;
052024 but I make account of none of these, neither do I count my life precious to myself, so that I finish my course with joy, and the ministration that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify fully the good news of the grace of God.
052025 'And now, lo, I have known that no more shall ye see my face, -- ye all among whom I did go preaching the reign of God;
052026 wherefore I take you to witness this day, that I [am] clear from the blood of all,
052027 for I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God.
052028 'Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed the assembly of God that He acquired through His own blood,
052029 for I have known this, that there shall enter in, after my departing, grievous wolves unto you, not sparing the flock,
052030 and of your own selves there shall arise men, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
052031 'Therefore, watch, remembering that three years, night and day, I did not cease with tears warning each one;
052032 and now, I commend you, brethren, to God, and to the word of His grace, that is able to build up, and to give you an inheritance among all those sanctified.
052033 'The silver or gold or garments of no one did I covet;
052034 and ye yourselves know that to my necessities, and to those who were with me, minister did these hands;
052035 all things I did shew you, that, thus labouring, it behoveth [us] to partake with the ailing, to be mindful also of the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.'
052036 And these things having said, having bowed his knees, with them all, he did pray,
052037 and there came a great weeping to all, and having fallen upon the neck of Paul, they were kissing him,
052038 sorrowing most of all for the word that he had said -- that they are about no more to see his face; and they were accompanying him to the ship.
052101 And it came to pass, at our sailing, having been parted from them, having run direct, we came to Coos, and the succeeding [day] to Rhodes, and thence to Patara,
052102 and having found a ship passing over to Phenicia, having gone on board, we sailed,
052103 and having discovered Cyprus, and having left it on the left, we were sailing to Syria, and did land at Tyre, for there was the ship discharging the lading.
052104 And having found out the disciples, we tarried there seven days, and they said to Paul, through the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem;
052105 but when it came that we completed the days, having gone forth, we went on, all bringing us on the way, with women and children, unto the outside of the city, and having bowed the knees upon the shore, we prayed,
052106 and having embraced one another, we embarked in the ship, and they returned to their own friends.
052107 And we, having finished the course, from Tyre came down to Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained one day with them;
052108 and on the morrow Paul and his company having gone forth, we came to Cesarea, and having entered into the house of Philip the evangelist -- who is of the seven -- we remained with him,
052109 and this one had four daughters, virgins, prophesying.
052110 And we remaining many more days, there came down a certain one from Judea, a prophet, by name Agabus,
052111 and he having come unto us, and having taken up the girdle of Paul, having bound also his own hands and feet, said, 'Thus saith the Holy Spirit, The man whose is this girdle -- so shall the Jews in Jerusalem bind, and they shall deliver [him] up to the hands of nations.'
052112 And when we heard these things, we called upon [him] -- both we, and those of that place -- not to go up to Jerusalem,
052113 and Paul answered, 'What do ye -- weeping, and crushing mine heart? for I, not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem, am ready, for the name of the Lord Jesus;'
052114 and he not being persuaded, we were silent, saying, 'The will of the Lord be done.'
052115 And after these days, having taken [our] vessels, we were going up to Jerusalem,
052116 and there went also of the disciples from Cesarea with us, bringing with them him with whom we may lodge, a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an aged disciple.
052117 And we having come to Jerusalem, the brethren did gladly receive us,
052118 and on the morrow Paul was going in with us unto James, all the elders also came,
052119 and having saluted them, he was declaring, one by one, each of the things God did among the nations through his ministration,
052120 and they having heard, were glorifying the Lord. They said also to him, 'Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of Jews who have believed, and all are zealous of the law,
052121 and they are instructed concerning thee, that apostacy from Moses thou dost teach to all Jews among the nations, saying -- Not to circumcise the children, nor after the customs to walk;
052122 what then is it? certainly the multitude it behoveth to come together, for they will hear that thou hast come.
052123 'This, therefore, do that we say to thee: We have four men having a vow on themselves,
052124 these having taken, be purified with them, and be at expence with them, that they may shave the head, and all may know that the things of which they have been instructed concerning thee are nothing, but thou dost walk -- thyself also -- the law keeping.
052125 'And concerning those of the nations who have believed, we have written, having given judgment, that they observe no such thing, except to keep themselves both from idol-sacrifices, and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom.'
052126 Then Paul, having taken the men, on the following day, with them having purified himself, was entering into the temple, announcing the fulfilment of the days of the purification, till the offering was offered for each one of them.
052127 And, as the seven days were about to be fully ended, the Jews from Asia having beheld him in the temple, were stirring up all the multitude, and they laid hands upon him,
052128 crying out, 'Men, Israelites, help! this is the man who, against the people, and the law, and this place, all everywhere is teaching; and further, also, Greeks he brought into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place;'
052129 for they had seen before Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the city with him, whom they were supposing that Paul brought into the temple.
052130 All the city also was moved and there was a running together of the people, and having laid hold on Paul, they were drawing him out of the temple, and immediately were the doors shut,
052131 and they seeking to kill him, a rumour came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem hath been thrown into confusion,
052132 who, at once, having taken soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them, and they having seen the chief captain and the soldiers, did leave off beating Paul.
052133 Then the chief captain, having come nigh, took him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains, and was inquiring who he may be, and what it is he hath been doing,
052134 and some were crying out one thing, and some another, among the multitude, and not being able to know the certainty because of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried to the castle,
052135 and when he came upon the steps, it happened he was borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the multitude,
052136 for the crowd of the people was following after, crying, 'Away with him.'
052137 And Paul being about to be led into the castle, saith to the chief captain, 'Is it permitted to me to say anything unto thee?' and he said, 'Greek dost thou know?
052138 art not thou, then, the Egyptian who before these days made an uprising, and did lead into the desert the four thousand men of the assassins?'
052139 And Paul said, 'I, indeed, am a man, a Jew, of Tarsus of Cilicia, of no mean city a citizen; and I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.'
052140 And he having given him leave, Paul having stood upon the stairs, did beckon with the hand to the people, and there having been a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew dialect, saying:
052201 'Men, brethren, and fathers, hear my defence now unto you;' --
052202 and they having heard that in the Hebrew dialect he was speaking to them, gave the more silence, and he saith, --
052203 'I, indeed, am a man, a Jew, having been born in Tarsus of Cilicia, and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, having been taught according to the exactitude of a law of the fathers, being zealous of God, as all ye are to-day.
052204 'And this way I persecuted unto death, binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women,
052205 as also the chief priest doth testify to me, and all the eldership; from whom also having received letters unto the brethren, to Damascus, I was going on, to bring also those there bound to Jerusalem that they might be punished,
052206 and it came to pass, in my going on and coming nigh to Damascus, about noon, suddenly out of the heaven there shone a great light round about me,
052207 I fell also to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why me dost thou persecute?
052208 'And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? and he said unto me, I am Jesus the Nazarene whom thou dost persecute --
052209 and they who are with me the light did see, and became afraid, and the voice they heard not of him who is speaking to me --
052210 and I said, What shall I do, Lord? and the Lord said unto me, Having risen, go on to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee concerning all things that have been appointed for thee to do.
052211 'And when I did not see from the glory of that light, being led by the hand by those who are with me, I came to Damascus,
052212 and a certain one, Ananias, a pious man according to the law, being testified to by all the Jews dwelling [there],
052213 having come unto me and stood by [me], said to me, Saul, brother, look up; and I the same hour did look up to him;
052214 and he said, The God of our fathers did choose thee beforehand to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice out of his mouth,
052215 because thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard;
052216 and now, why tarriest thou? having risen, baptize thyself, and wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.
052217 'And it came to pass when I returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, I came into a trance,
052218 and I saw him saying to me, Haste and go forth in haste out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me;
052219 and I said, Lord, they -- they know that I was imprisoning and was scourging in every synagogue those believing on thee;
052220 and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was being poured forth, I also was standing by and assenting to his death, and keeping the garments of those putting him to death;
052221 and he said unto me, Go, because to nations far off I will send thee.'
052222 And they were hearing him unto this word, and they lifted up their voice, saying, 'Away from the earth with such an one; for it is not fit for him to live.'
052223 And they crying out and casting up their garments, and throwing dust into the air,
052224 the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, saying, 'By scourges let him be examined;' that he might know for what cause they were crying so against him.
052225 And as he was stretching him with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion who was standing by, 'A man, a Roman, uncondemned -- is it lawful to you to scourge;'
052226 and the centurion having heard, having gone near to the chief captain, told, saying, 'Take heed what thou art about to do, for this man is a Roman;'
052227 and the chief captain having come near, said to him, 'Tell me, art thou a Roman?' and he said, 'Yes;'
052228 and the chief captain answered, 'I, with a great sum, did obtain this citizenship;' but Paul said, 'But I have been even born [so].'
052229 Immediately, therefore, they departed from him who are about to examine him, and the chief captain also was afraid, having learned that he is a Roman, and because he had bound him,
052230 and on the morrow, intending to know the certainty wherefore he is accused by the Jews, he did loose him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrim to come, and having brought down Paul, he set [him] before them.
052301 And Paul having earnestly beheld the sanhedrim, said, 'Men, brethren, I in all good conscience have lived to God unto this day;'
052302 and the chief priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to smite him on the mouth,
052303 then Paul said unto him, 'God is about to smite thee, thou whitewashed wall, and thou -- thou dost sit judging me according to the law, and, violating law, dost order me to be smitten!'
052304 And those who stood by said, 'The chief priest of God dost thou revile?'
052305 and Paul said, 'I did not know, brethren, that he is chief priest: for it hath been written, Of the ruler of thy people thou shalt not speak evil;'
052306 and Paul having known that the one part are Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the sanhedrim, 'Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee -- son of a Pharisee -- concerning hope and rising again of dead men I am judged.'
052307 And he having spoken this, there came a dissension of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees, and the crowd was divided,
052308 for Sadducees, indeed, say there is no rising again, nor messenger, nor spirit, but Pharisees confess both.
052309 And there came a great cry, and the scribes of the Pharisees' part having arisen, were striving, saying, 'No evil do we find in this man; and if a spirit spake to him, or a messenger, we may not fight against God;'
052310 and a great dissension having come, the chief captain having been afraid lest Paul may be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiery, having gone down, to take him by force out of the midst of them, and to bring [him] to the castle.
052311 And on the following night, the Lord having stood by him, said, 'Take courage, Paul, for as thou didst fully testify the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so it behoveth thee also at Rome to testify.'
052312 And day having come, certain of the Jews having made a concourse, did anathematize themselves, saying neither to eat nor to drink till they may kill Paul;
052313 and they were more than forty who made this conspiracy by oath,
052314 who having come near to the chief priests and to the elders said, 'With an anathema we did anathematize ourselves -- to taste nothing till we have killed Paul;
052315 now, therefore, ye, signify ye to the chief captain, with the sanhedrim, that to-morrow he may bring him down unto you, as being about to know more exactly the things concerning him; and we, before his coming nigh, are ready to put him to death.'
052316 And the son of Paul's sister having heard of the lying in wait, having gone and entered into the castle, told Paul,
052317 and Paul having called near one of the centurions, said, 'This young man lead unto the chief captain, for he hath something to tell him.'
052318 He indeed, then, having taken him, brought him unto the chief captain, and saith, 'The prisoner Paul, having called me near, asked [me] this young man to bring unto thee, having something to say to thee.'
052319 And the chief captain having taken him by the hand, and having withdrawn by themselves, inquired, 'What is that which thou hast to tell me?'
052320 and he said -- 'The Jews agreed to request thee, that to-morrow to the sanhedrim thou mayest bring down Paul, as being about to enquire something more exactly concerning him;
052321 thou, therefore, mayest thou not yield to them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who did anathematize themselves -- not to eat nor to drink till they kill him, and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from thee.'
052322 The chief captain, then, indeed, let the young man go, having charged [him] to tell no one, 'that these things thou didst shew unto me;'
052323 and having called near a certain two of the centurions, he said, 'Make ready soldiers two hundred, that they may go on unto Caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, from the third hour of the night;
052324 beasts also provide, that, having set Paul on, they may bring him safe unto Felix the governor;'
052325 he having written a letter after this description:
052326 'Claudius Lysias, to the most noble governor Felix, hail:
052327 This man having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them -- having come with the soldiery, I rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman;
052328 and, intending to know the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their sanhedrim,
052329 whom I found accused concerning questions of their law, and having no accusation worthy of death or bonds;
052330 and a plot having been intimated to me against this man -- about to be of the Jews -- at once I sent unto thee, having given command also to the accusers to say the things against him before thee; be strong.'
052331 Then, indeed, the soldiers according to that directed them, having taken up Paul, brought him through the night to Antipatris,
052332 and on the morrow, having suffered the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the castle;
052333 those having entered into Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, did present also Paul to him.
052334 And the governor having read [it], and inquired of what province he is, and understood that [he is] from Cilicia;
052335 'I will hear thee -- said he -- when thine accusers also may have come;' he also commanded him to be kept in the praetorium of Herod.
052401 And after five days came down the chief priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator -- Tertullus, and they made manifest to the governor [the things] against Paul;
052402 and he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, 'Much peace enjoying through thee, and worthy deeds being done to this nation through thy forethought,
052403 always, also, and everywhere we receive it, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness;
052404 and that I may not be further tedious to thee, I pray thee to hear us concisely in thy gentleness;
052405 for having found this man a pestilence, and moving a dissension to all the Jews through the world -- a ringleader also of the sect of the Nazarenes --
052406 who also the temple did try to profane, whom also we took, and according to our law did wish to judge,
052407 and Lysias the chief captain having come near, with much violence, out of our hands did take away,
052408 having commanded his accusers to come to thee, from whom thou mayest be able, thyself having examined, to know concerning all these things of which we accuse him;'
052409 and the Jews also agreed, professing these things to be so.
052410 And Paul answered -- the governor having beckoned to him to speak -- 'Knowing [that] for many years thou hast been a judge to this nation, the more cheerfully the things concerning myself I do answer;
052411 thou being able to know that it is not more than twelve days to me since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,
052412 and neither in the temple did they find me reasoning with any one, or making a dissension of the multitude, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;
052413 nor are they able to prove against me the things concerning which they now accuse me.
052414 'And I confess this to thee, that, according to the way that they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers, believing all things that in the law and the prophets have been written,
052415 having hope toward God, which they themselves also wait for, [that] there is about to be a rising again of the dead, both of righteous and unrighteous;
052416 and in this I do exercise myself, to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.
052417 'And after many years I came, about to do kind acts to my nation, and offerings,
052418 in which certain Jews from Asia did find me purified in the temple, not with multitude, nor with tumult,
052419 whom it behoveth to be present before thee, and to accuse, if they had anything against me,
052420 or let these same say if they found any unrighteousness in me in my standing before the sanhedrim,
052421 except concerning this one voice, in which I cried, standing among them -- Concerning a rising again of the dead I am judged to-day by you.'
052422 And having heard these things, Felix delayed them -- having known more exactly of the things concerning the way -- saying, 'When Lysias the chief captain may come down, I will know fully the things concerning you;'
052423 having given also a direction to the centurion to keep Paul, to let [him] also have liberty, and to forbid none of his own friends to minister or to come near to him.
052424 And after certain days, Felix having come with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith toward Christ,
052425 and he reasoning concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment that is about to be, Felix, having become afraid, answered, 'For the present be going, and having got time, I will call for thee;'
052426 and at the same time also hoping that money shall be given to him by Paul, that he may release him, therefore, also sending for him the oftener, he was conversing with him;
052427 and two years having been fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus; Felix also willing to lay a favour on the Jews, left Paul bound.
052501 Festus, therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea,
052502 and the chief priest and the principal men of the Jews made manifest to him [the things] against Paul, and were calling on him,
052503 asking favour against him, that he may send for him to Jerusalem, making an ambush to put him to death in the way.
052504 Then, indeed, Festus answered that Paul is kept in Caesarea, and himself is about speedily to go on thither,
052505 'Therefore those able among you -- saith he -- having come down together, if there be anything in this man -- let them accuse him;'
052506 and having tarried among them more than ten days, having gone down to Caesarea, on the morrow having sat upon the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought;
052507 and he having come, there stood round about the Jews who have come down from Jerusalem -- many and weighty charges they are bringing against Paul, which they were not able to prove,
052508 he making defence -- 'Neither in regard to the law of the Jews, nor in regard to the temple, nor in regard to Caesar -- did I commit any sin.'
052509 And Festus willing to lay on the Jews a favour, answering Paul, said, 'Art thou willing, to Jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?'
052510 and Paul said, 'At the tribunal of Caesar I am standing, where it behoveth me to be judged; to Jews I did no unrighteousness, as thou dost also very well know;
052511 for if indeed I am unrighteous, and anything worthy of death have done, I deprecate not to die; and if there is none of the things of which these accuse me, no one is able to make a favour of me to them; to Caesar I appeal!'
052512 then Festus, having communed with the council, answered, 'To Caesar thou hast appealed; to Caesar thou shalt go.'
052513 And certain days having passed, Agrippa the king, and Bernice, came down to Caesarea saluting Festus,
052514 and as they were continuing there more days, Festus submitted to the king the things concerning Paul, saying, 'There is a certain man, left by Felix, a prisoner,
052515 about whom, in my being at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid information, asking a decision against him,
052516 unto whom I answered, that it is not a custom of Romans to make a favour of any man to die, before that he who is accused may have the accusers face to face, and may receive place of defence in regard to the charge laid against [him].
052517 'They, therefore, having come together -- I, making no delay, on the succeeding [day] having sat upon the tribunal, did command the man to be brought,
052518 concerning whom the accusers, having stood up, were bringing against [him] no accusation of the things I was thinking of,
052519 but certain questions concerning their own religion they had against him, and concerning a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive;
052520 and I, doubting in regard to the question concerning this, said, If he would wish to go on to Jerusalem, and there to be judged concerning these things --
052521 but Paul having appealed to be kept to the hearing of Sebastus, I did command him to be kept till I might send him unto Caesar.'
052522 And Agrippa said unto Festus, 'I was wishing also myself to hear the man;' and he said, 'To-morrow thou shalt hear him;'
052523 on the morrow, therefore -- on the coming of Agrippa and Bernice with much display, and they having entered into the audience chamber, with the chief captains also, and the principal men of the city, and Festus having ordered -- Paul was brought forth.
052524 And Festus said, 'King Agrippa, and all men who are present with us, ye see this one, about whom all the multitude of the Jews did deal with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out, He ought not to live any longer;
052525 and I, having found him to have done nothing worthy of death, and he also himself having appealed to Sebastus, I decided to send him,
052526 concerning whom I have no certain thing to write to [my] lord, wherefore I brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that the examination having been made, I may have something to write;
052527 for it doth seem to me irrational, sending a prisoner, not also to signify the charges against him.'
052601 And Agrippa said unto Paul, 'It is permitted to thee to speak for thyself;' then Paul having stretched forth the hand, was making a defence:
052602 'Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I have thought myself happy, being about to make a defence before thee to-day,
052603 especially knowing thee to be acquainted with all things -- both customs and questions -- among Jews; wherefore, I beseech thee, patiently to hear me.
052604 'The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth -- which from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem -- know do all the Jews,
052605 knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I lived a Pharisee;
052606 and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by God, I have stood judged,
052607 to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving, do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews;
052608 why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?
052609 'I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved [me] many things to do,
052610 which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against them,
052611 and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was constraining [them] to speak evil, being also exceedingly mad against them, I was also persecuting [them] even unto strange cities.
052612 'In which things, also, going on to Damascus -- with authority and commission from the chief priests --
052613 at mid-day, I saw in the way, O king, out of heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me a light -- and those going on with me;
052614 and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why me dost thou persecute? hard for thee against pricks to kick!
052615 'And I said, Who art thou, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute;
052616 but rise, and stand upon thy feet, for for this I appeared to thee, to appoint thee an officer and a witness both of the things thou didst see, and of the things [in which] I will appear to thee,
052617 delivering thee from the people, and the nations, to whom now I send thee,
052618 to open their eyes, to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the authority of the Adversary unto God, for their receiving forgiveness of sins, and a lot among those having been sanctified, by faith that [is] toward me.
052619 'Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
052620 but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem, to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works worthy of reformation;
052621 because of these things the Jews -- having caught me in the temple -- were endeavouring to kill [me].
052622 'Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day, I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses spake of as about to come,
052623 that the Christ is to suffer, whether first by a rising from the dead, he is about to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.'
052624 And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice said, 'Thou art mad, Paul; much learning doth turn thee mad;'
052625 and he saith, 'I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth;
052626 for the king doth know concerning these things, before whom also I speak boldly, for none of these things, I am persuaded, are hidden from him; for this thing hath not been done in a corner;
052627 thou dost believe, king Agrippa, the prophets? I have known that thou dost believe!'
052628 And Agrippa said unto Paul, 'In a little thou dost persuade me to become a Christian!'
052629 and Paul said, 'I would have wished to God, both in a little, and in much, not only thee, but also all those hearing me to-day, to become such as I also am -- except these bonds.'
052630 And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them,
052631 and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another, saying -- 'This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds;'
052632 and Agrippa said to Festus, 'This man might have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.'
052701 And when our sailing to Italy was determined, they were delivering up both Paul and certain others, prisoners, to a centurion, by name Julius, of the band of Sebastus,
052702 and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, we, being about to sail by the coasts of Asia, did set sail, there being with us Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica,
052703 on the next [day] also we touched at Sidon, and Julius, courteously treating Paul, did permit [him], having gone on unto friends, to receive [their] care.
052704 And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus, because of the winds being contrary,
052705 and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myria of Lycia,
052706 and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy, did put us into it,
052707 and having sailed slowly many days, and with difficulty coming over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone,
052708 and hardly passing it, we came to a certain place called 'Fair Havens,' nigh to which was the city [of] Lasaea.
052709 And much time being spent, and the sailing being now dangerous -- because of the fast also being already past -- Paul was admonishing,
052710 saying to them, 'Men, I perceive that with hurt, and much damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of our lives -- the voyage is about to be;'
052711 but the centurion to the pilot and to the shipowner gave credence more than to the things spoken by Paul;
052712 and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they might be able, having attained to Phenice, [there] to winter, [which is] a haven of Crete, looking to the south-west and north-west,
052713 and a south wind blowing softly, having thought they had obtained [their] purpose, having lifted anchor, they sailed close by Crete,
052714 and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, that is called Euroclydon,
052715 and the ship being caught, and not being able to bear up against the wind, having given [her] up, we were borne on,
052716 and having run under a certain little isle, called Clauda, we were hardly able to become masters of the boat,
052717 which having taken up, they were using helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they may fall on the quicksand, having let down the mast -- so were borne on.
052718 And we, being exceedingly tempest-tossed, the succeeding [day] they were making a clearing,
052719 and on the third [day] with our own hands the tackling of the ship we cast out,
052720 and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and not a little tempest lying upon us, thenceforth all hope was taken away of our being saved.
052721 And there having been long fasting, then Paul having stood in the midst of them, said, 'It behoved [you], indeed, O men -- having hearkened to me -- not to set sail from Crete, and to save this hurt and damage;
052722 and now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of life among you -- but of the ship;
052723 for there stood by me this night a messenger of God -- whose I am, and whom I serve --
052724 saying, Be not afraid Paul; before Caesar it behoveth thee to stand; and, lo, God hath granted to thee all those sailing with thee;
052725 wherefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that so it shall be, even as it hath been spoken to me,
052726 and on a certain island it behoveth us to be cast.'
052727 And when the fourteenth night came -- we being borne up and down in the Adria -- toward the middle of the night the sailors were supposing that some country drew nigh to them;
052728 and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found fifteen fathoms,
052729 and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the stern having cast four anchors, they were wishing day to come.
052730 And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat to the sea, in pretence as [if] out of the foreship they are about to cast anchors,
052731 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, 'If these do not remain in the ship -- ye are not able to be saved;'
052732 then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and suffered it to fall off.
052733 And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon all to partake of nourishment, saying, 'Fourteen days to-day, waiting, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing,
052734 wherefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the head fall;'
052735 and having said these things, and having taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken [it], he began to eat;
052736 and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took food,
052737 (and we were -- all the souls in the ship -- two hundred, seventy and six),
052738 and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea.
052739 And when the day came, they were not discerning the land, but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship,
052740 and the anchors having taken up, they were committing [it] to the sea, at the same time -- having loosed the bands of the rudders, and having hoisted up the mainsail to the wind -- they were making for the shore,
052741 and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast, did remain immoveable, but the hinder-part was broken by the violence of the waves.
052742 And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape,
052743 but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having cast themselves out first -- to get unto the land,
052744 and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all came safe unto the land.
052801 And having been saved, then they knew that the island is called Melita,
052802 and the foreigners were shewing us no ordinary kindness, for having kindled a fire, they received us all, because of the pressing rain, and because of the cold;
052803 but Paul having gathered together a quantity of sticks, and having laid [them] upon the fire, a viper -- out of the heat having come -- did fasten on his hand.
052804 And when the foreigners saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said unto one another, 'Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, having been saved out of the sea, the justice did not suffer to live;'
052805 he then, indeed, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered no evil,
052806 and they were expecting him to be about to be inflamed, or to fall down suddenly dead, and they, expecting [it] a long time, and seeing nothing uncommon happening to him, changing [their] minds, said he was a god.
052807 And in the neighbourhood of that place were lands of the principal man of the island, by name Publius, who, having received us, three days did courteously lodge [us];
052808 and it came to pass, the father of Publius with feverish heats and dysentery pressed, was laid, unto whom Paul having entered, and having prayed, having laid [his] hands on him, healed him;
052809 this, therefore, being done, the others also in the island having infirmities were coming and were healed;
052810 who also with many honours did honour us, and we setting sail -- they were lading [us] with the things that were necessary.
052811 And after three months, we set sail in a ship (that had wintered in the isle) of Alexandria, with the sign Dioscuri,
052812 and having landed at Syracuse, we remained three days,
052813 thence having gone round, we came to Rhegium, and after one day, a south wind having sprung up, the second [day] we came to Puteoli;
052814 where, having found brethren, we were called upon to remain with them seven days, and thus to Rome we came;
052815 and thence, the brethren having heard the things concerning us, came forth to meet us, unto Appii Forum, and Three Taverns -- whom Paul having seen, having given thanks to God, took courage.
052816 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the captain of the barrack, but Paul was suffered to remain by himself, with the soldier guarding him.
052817 And it came to pass after three days, Paul called together those who are the principal men of the Jews, and they having come together, he said unto them: 'Men, brethren, I -- having done nothing contrary to the people, or to the customs of the fathers -- a prisoner from Jerusalem, was delivered up to the hands of the Romans;
052818 who, having examined me, were wishing to release [me], because of their being no cause of death in me,
052819 and the Jews having spoken against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar -- not as having anything to accuse my nation of;
052820 for this cause, therefore, I called for you to see and to speak with [you], for because of the hope of Israel with this chain I am bound.'
052821 And they said unto him, 'We did neither receive letters concerning thee from Judea, nor did any one who came of the brethren declare or speak any evil concerning thee,
052822 and we think it good from thee to hear what thou dost think, for, indeed, concerning this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against;'
052823 and having appointed him a day, they came, more of them unto him, to the lodging, to whom he was expounding, testifying fully the reign of God, persuading them also of the things concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morning till evening,
052824 and, some, indeed, were believing the things spoken, and some were not believing.
052825 And not being agreed with one another, they were going away, Paul having spoken one word -- 'Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,
052826 saying, Go on unto this people and say, With hearing ye shall hear, and ye shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and ye shall not perceive,
052827 for made gross was the heart of this people, and with the ears they heard heavily, and their eyes they did close, lest they may see with the eyes, and with the heart may understand, and be turned back, and I may heal them.
052828 'Be it known, therefore, to you, that to the nations was sent the salvation of God, these also will hear it;'
052829 and he having said these things, the Jews went away, having much disputation among themselves;
052830 and Paul remained an entire two years in his own hired [house], and was receiving all those coming in unto him,
052831 preaching the reign of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness -- unforbidden.
060101 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, having been separated to the good news of God --
060102 which He announced before through His prophets in holy writings --
060103 concerning His Son, (who is come of the seed of David according to the flesh,
060104 who is marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of sanctification, by the rising again from the dead,) Jesus Christ our Lord;
060105 through whom we did receive grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, in behalf of his name;
060106 among whom are also ye, the called of Jesus Christ;
060107 to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints; Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ!
060108 first, indeed, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world;
060109 for God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you,
060110 always in my prayers beseeching, if by any means now at length I shall have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you,
060111 for I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that ye may be established;
060112 and that is, that I may be comforted together among you, through the faith in one another, both yours and mine.
060113 And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that many times I did purpose to come unto you -- and was hindered till the present time -- that some fruit I might have also among you, even as also among the other nations.
060114 Both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to wise and to thoughtless, I am a debtor,
060115 so, as much as in me is, I am ready also to you who [are] in Rome to proclaim good news,
060116 for I am not ashamed of the good news of the Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation to every one who is believing, both to Jew first, and to Greek.
060117 For the righteousness of God in it is revealed from faith to faith, according as it hath been written, 'And the righteous one by faith shall live,'
060118 for revealed is the wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety and unrighteousness of men, holding down the truth in unrighteousness.
060119 Because that which is known of God is manifest among them, for God did manifest [it] to them,
060120 for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, by the things made being understood, are plainly seen, both His eternal power and Godhead -- to their being inexcusable;
060121 because, having known God they did not glorify [Him] as God, nor gave thanks, but were made vain in their reasonings, and their unintelligent heart was darkened,
060122 professing to be wise, they were made fools,
060123 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of fowls, and of quadrupeds, and of reptiles.
060124 Wherefore also God did give them up, in the desires of their hearts, to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies among themselves;
060125 who did change the truth of God into a falsehood, and did honour and serve the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed to the ages. Amen.
060126 Because of this did God give them up to dishonourable affections, for even their females did change the natural use into that against nature;
060127 and in like manner also the males having left the natural use of the female, did burn in their longing toward one another; males with males working shame, and the recompense of their error that was fit, in themselves receiving.
060128 And, according as they did not approve of having God in knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things not seemly;
060129 having been filled with all unrighteousness, whoredom, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers,
060130 evil-speakers, God-haters, insulting, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
060131 unintelligent, faithless, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful;
060132 who the righteous judgment of God having known -- that those practising such things are worthy of death -- not only do them, but also have delight with those practising them.
060201 Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O man -- every one who is judging -- for in that in which thou dost judge the other, thyself thou dost condemn, for the same things thou dost practise who art judging,
060202 and we have known that the judgment of God is according to truth, upon those practising such things.
060203 And dost thou think this, O man, who art judging those who such things are practising, and art doing them, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
060204 or the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, dost thou despise? -- not knowing that the goodness of God doth lead thee to reformation!
060205 but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou dost treasure up to thyself wrath, in a day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
060206 who shall render to each according to his works;
060207 to those, indeed, who in continuance of a good work, do seek glory, and honour, and incorruptibility -- life age-during;
060208 and to those contentious, and disobedient, indeed, to the truth, and obeying the unrighteousness -- indignation and wrath,
060209 tribulation and distress, upon every soul of man that is working the evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;
060210 and glory, and honour, and peace, to every one who is working the good, both to Jew first, and to Greek.
060211 For there is no acceptance of faces with God,
060212 for as many as without law did sin, without law also shall perish, and as many as did sin in law, through law shall be judged,
060213 for not the hearers of the law [are] righteous before God, but the doers of the law shall be declared righteous: --
060214 For, when nations that have not a law, by nature may do the things of the law, these not having a law -- to themselves are a law;
060215 who do shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also witnessing with them, and between one another the thoughts accusing or else defending,
060216 in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my good news, through Jesus Christ.
060217 Lo, thou art named a Jew, and dost rest upon the law, and dost boast in God,
060218 and dost know the will, and dost approve the distinctions, being instructed out of the law,
060219 and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of blind ones, a light of those in darkness,
060220 an instructor of foolish ones, a teacher of babes, having the form of the knowledge and of the truth in the law.
060221 Thou, then, who art teaching another, thyself dost thou not teach?
060222 thou who art preaching not to steal, dost thou steal? thou who art saying not to commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou who art abhorring the idols, dost thou rob temples?
060223 thou who in the law dost boast, through the transgression of the law God dost thou dishonour?
060224 for the name of God because of you is evil spoken of among the nations, according as it hath been written.
060225 For circumcision, indeed, doth profit, if law thou mayest practise, but if a transgressor of law thou mayest be, thy circumcision hath become uncircumcision.
060226 If, therefore the uncircumcision the righteousness of the law may keep, shall not his uncircumcision for circumcision be reckoned?
060227 and the uncircumcision, by nature, fulfilling the law, shall judge thee who, through letter and circumcision, [art] a transgressor of law.
060228 For he is not a Jew who is [so] outwardly, neither [is] circumcision that which is outward in flesh;
060229 but a Jew [is] he who is [so] inwardly, and circumcision [is] of the heart, in spirit, not in letter, of which the praise is not of men, but of God.
060301 What, then, [is] the superiority of the Jew? or what the profit of the circumcision?
060302 much in every way; for first, indeed, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God;
060303 for what, if certain were faithless? shall their faithlessness the faithfulness of god make useless?
060304 let it not be! and let God become true, and every man false, according as it hath been written, 'That Thou mayest be declared righteous in Thy words, and mayest overcome in Thy being judged.'
060305 And, if our unrighteousness God's righteousness doth establish, what shall we say? is God unrighteous who is inflicting the wrath? (after the manner of a man I speak)
060306 let it not be! since how shall God judge the world?
060307 for if the truth of God in my falsehood did more abound to His glory, why yet am I also as a sinner judged?
060308 and not, as we are evil spoken of, and as certain affirm us to say -- 'We may do the evil things, that the good ones may come?' whose judgment is righteous.
060309 What, then? are we better? not at all! for we did before charge both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin,
060310 according as it hath been written -- 'There is none righteous, not even one;
060311 There is none who is understanding, there is none who is seeking after God.
060312 All did go out of the way, together they became unprofitable, there is none doing good, there is not even one.
060313 A sepulchre opened [is] their throat; with their tongues they used deceit; poison of asps [is] under their lips.
060314 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
060315 Swift [are] their feet to shed blood.
060316 Ruin and misery [are] in their ways.
060317 And a way of peace they did not know.
060318 There is no fear of God before their eyes.'
060319 And we have known that as many things as the law saith, to those in the law it doth speak, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may come under judgment to God;
060320 wherefore by works of law shall no flesh be declared righteous before Him, for through law is a knowledge of sin.
060321 And now apart from law hath the righteousness of God been manifested, testified to by the law and the prophets,
060322 and the righteousness of God [is] through the faith of Jesus Christ to all, and upon all those believing, -- for there is no difference,
060323 for all did sin, and are come short of the glory of God --
060324 being declared righteous freely by His grace through the redemption that [is] in Christ Jesus,
060325 whom God did set forth a mercy seat, through the faith in his blood, for the shewing forth of His righteousness, because of the passing over of the bygone sins in the forbearance of God --
060326 for the shewing forth of His righteousness in the present time, for His being righteous, and declaring him righteous who [is] of the faith of Jesus.
060327 Where then [is] the boasting? it was excluded; by what law? of works? no, but by a law of faith:
060328 therefore do we reckon a man to be declared righteous by faith, apart from works of law.
060329 The God of Jews only [is He], and not also of nations?
060330 yes, also of nations; since one [is] God who shall declare righteous the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through the faith.
060331 Law then do we make useless through the faith? let it not be! yea, we do establish law.
060401 What, then, shall we say Abraham our father, to have found, according to flesh?
060402 for if Abraham by works was declared righteous, he hath to boast -- but not before god;
060403 for what doth the writing say? 'And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;'
060404 and to him who is working, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt;
060405 and to him who is not working, and is believing upon Him who is declaring righteous the impious, his faith is reckoned -- to righteousness:
060406 even as David also doth speak of the happiness of the man to whom God doth reckon righteousness apart from works:
060407 'Happy they whose lawless acts were forgiven, and whose sins were covered;
060408 happy the man to whom the Lord may not reckon sin.'
060409 [Is] this happiness, then, upon the circumcision, or also upon the uncircumcision -- for we say that the faith was reckoned to Abraham -- to righteousness?
060410 how then was it reckoned? he being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;
060411 and a sign he did receive of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith in the uncircumcision, for his being father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for the righteousness also being reckoned to them,
060412 and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, that [is] in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.
060413 For not through law [is] the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, of his being heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith;
060414 for if they who are of law [are] heirs, the faith hath been made void, and the promise hath been made useless;
060415 for the law doth work wrath; for where law is not, neither [is] transgression.
060416 Because of this [it is] of faith, that [it may be] according to grace, for the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that which [is] of the law only, but also to that which [is] of the faith of Abraham,
060417 who is father of us all (according as it hath been written -- 'A father of many nations I have set thee,') before Him whom he did believe -- God, who is quickening the dead, and is calling the things that be not as being.
060418 Who, against hope in hope did believe, for his becoming father of many nations according to that spoken: 'So shall thy seed be;'
060419 and not having been weak in the faith, he did not consider his own body, already become dead, (being about a hundred years old,) and the deadness of Sarah's womb,
060420 and at the promise of God did not stagger in unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God,
060421 and having been fully persuaded that what He hath promised He is able also to do:
060422 wherefore also it was reckoned to him to righteousness.
060423 And it was not written on his account alone, that it was reckoned to him,
060424 but also on ours, to whom it is about to be reckoned -- to us believing on Him who did raise up Jesus our Lord out of the dead,
060425 who was delivered up because of our offences, and was raised up because of our being declared righteous.
060501 Having been declared righteous, then, by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
060502 through whom also we have the access by the faith into this grace in which we have stood, and we boast on the hope of the glory of God.
060503 And not only [so], but we also boast in the tribulations, knowing that the tribulation doth work endurance;
060504 and the endurance, experience; and the experience, hope;
060505 and the hope doth not make ashamed, because the love of God hath been poured forth in our hearts through the Holy Spirit that hath been given to us.
060506 For in our being still ailing, Christ in due time did die for the impious;
060507 for scarcely for a righteous man will any one die, for for the good man perhaps some one also doth dare to die;
060508 and God doth commend His own love to us, that, in our being still sinners, Christ did die for us;
060509 much more, then, having been declared righteous now in his blood, we shall be saved through him from the wrath;
060510 for if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in his life.
060511 And not only [so], but we are also boasting in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we did receive the reconciliation;
060512 because of this, even as through one man the sin did enter into the world, and through the sin the death; and thus to all men the death did pass through, for that all did sin;
060513 for till law sin was in the world: and sin is not reckoned when there is not law;
060514 but the death did reign from Adam till Moses, even upon those not having sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of him who is coming.
060515 But, not as the offence so also [is] the free gift; for if by the offence of the one the many did die, much more did the grace of God, and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ, abound to the many;
060516 and not as through one who did sin [is] the free gift, for the judgment indeed [is] of one to condemnation, but the gift [is] of many offences to a declaration of 'Righteous,'
060517 for if by the offence of the one the death did reign through the one, much more those, who the abundance of the grace and of the free gift of the righteousness are receiving, in life shall reign through the one -- Jesus Christ.
060518 So, then, as through one offence to all men [it is] to condemnation, so also through one declaration of 'Righteous' [it is] to all men to justification of life;
060519 for as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were constituted sinners: so also through the obedience of the one, shall the many be constituted righteous.
060520 And law came in, that the offence might abound, and where the sin did abound, the grace did overabound,
060521 that even as the sin did reign in the death, so also the grace may reign, through righteousness, to life age-during, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
060601 What, then, shall we say? shall we continue in the sin that the grace may abound?
060602 let it not be! we who died to the sin -- how shall we still live in it?
060603 are ye ignorant that we, as many as were baptized to Christ Jesus, to his death were baptized?
060604 we were buried together, then, with him through the baptism to the death, that even as Christ was raised up out of the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we in newness of life might walk.
060605 For, if we have become planted together to the likeness of his death, [so] also we shall be of the rising again;
060606 this knowing, that our old man was crucified with [him], that the body of the sin may be made useless, for our no longer serving the sin;
060607 for he who hath died hath been set free from the sin.
060608 And if we died with Christ, we believe that we also shall live with him,
060609 knowing that Christ, having been raised up out of the dead, doth no more die, death over him hath no more lordship;
060610 for in that he died, to the sin he died once, and in that he liveth, he liveth to God;
060611 so also ye, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to the sin, and living to God in Jesus Christ our Lord.
060612 Let not then the sin reign in your mortal body, to obey it in its desires;
060613 neither present ye your members instruments of unrighteousness to the sin, but present yourselves to God as living out of the dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God;
060614 for sin over you shall not have lordship, for ye are not under law, but under grace.
060615 What then? shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? let it not be!
060616 have ye not known that to whom ye present yourselves servants for obedience, servants ye are to him to whom ye obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
060617 and thanks to God, that ye were servants of the sin, and -- were obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which ye were delivered up;
060618 and having been freed from the sin, ye became servants to the righteousness.
060619 In the manner of men I speak, because of the weakness of your flesh, for even as ye did present your members servants to the uncleanness and to the lawlessness -- to the lawlessness, so now present your members servants to the righteousness -- to sanctification,
060620 for when ye were servants of the sin, ye were free from the righteousness,
060621 what fruit, therefore, were ye having then, in the things of which ye are now ashamed? for the end of those [is] death.
060622 And now, having been freed from the sin, and having become servants to God, ye have your fruit -- to sanctification, and the end life age-during;
060623 for the wages of the sin [is] death, and the gift of God [is] life age-during in Christ Jesus our Lord.
060701 Are ye ignorant, brethren -- for to those knowing law I speak -- that the law hath lordship over the man as long as he liveth?
060702 for the married woman to the living husband hath been bound by law, and if the husband may die, she hath been free from the law of the husband;
060703 so, then, the husband being alive, an adulteress she shall be called if she may become another man's; and if the husband may die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, having become another man's.
060704 So that, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of the Christ, for your becoming another's, who out of the dead was raised up, that we might bear fruit to God;
060705 for when we were in the flesh, the passions of the sins, that [are] through the law, were working in our members, to bear fruit to the death;
060706 and now we have ceased from the law, that being dead in which we were held, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter.
060707 What, then, shall we say? the law [is] sin? let it not be! but the sin I did not know except through law, for also the covetousness I had not known if the law had not said:
060708 'Thou shalt not covet;' and the sin having received an opportunity, through the command, did work in me all covetousness -- for apart from law sin is dead.
060709 And I was alive apart from law once, and the command having come, the sin revived, and I died;
060710 and the command that [is] for life, this was found by me for death;
060711 for the sin, having received an opportunity, through the command, did deceive me, and through it did slay [me];
060712 so that the law, indeed, [is] holy, and the command holy, and righteous, and good.
060713 That which is good then, to me hath it become death? let it not be! but the sin, that it might appear sin, through the good, working death to me, that the sin might become exceeding sinful through the command,
060714 for we have known that the law is spiritual, and I am fleshly, sold by the sin;
060715 for that which I work, I do not acknowledge; for not what I will, this I practise, but what I hate, this I do.
060716 And if what I do not will, this I do, I consent to the law that [it is] good,
060717 and now it is no longer I that work it, but the sin dwelling in me,
060718 for I have known that there doth not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh, good: for to will is present with me, and to work that which is right I do not find,
060719 for the good that I will, I do not; but the evil that I do not will, this I practise.
060720 And if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it, but the sin that is dwelling in me.
060721 I find, then, the law, that when I desire to do what is right, with me the evil is present,
060722 for I delight in the law of God according to the inward man,
060723 and I behold another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of the sin that [is] in my members.
060724 A wretched man I [am]! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?
060725 I thank God -- through Jesus Christ our Lord; so then, I myself indeed with the mind do serve the law of God, and with the flesh, the law of sin.
060801 There is, then, now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit;
060802 for the law of the Spirit of the life in Christ Jesus did set me free from the law of the sin and of the death;
060803 for what the law was not able to do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, His own Son having sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, did condemn the sin in the flesh,
060804 that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
060805 For those who are according to the flesh, the things of the flesh do mind; and those according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit;
060806 for the mind of the flesh [is] death, and the mind of the Spirit -- life and peace;
060807 because the mind of the flesh [is] enmity to God, for to the law of God it doth not subject itself,
060808 for neither is it able; and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God.
060809 And ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God doth dwell in you; and if any one hath not the Spirit of Christ -- this one is not His;
060810 and if Christ [is] in you, the body, indeed, [is] dead because of sin, and the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness,
060811 and if the Spirit of Him who did raise up Jesus out of the dead doth dwell in you, He who did raise up the Christ out of the dead shall quicken also your dying bodies, through His Spirit dwelling in you.
060812 So, then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh;
060813 for if according to the flesh ye do live, ye are about to die; and if, by the Spirit, the deeds of the body ye put to death, ye shall live;
060814 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God;
060815 for ye did not receive a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye did receive a spirit of adoption in which we cry, 'Abba -- Father.'
060816 The Spirit himself doth testify with our spirit, that we are children of God;
060817 and if children, also heirs, heirs, indeed, of God, and heirs together of Christ -- if, indeed, we suffer together, that we may also be glorified together.
060818 For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory about to be revealed in us;
060819 for the earnest looking out of the creation doth expect the revelation of the sons of God;
060820 for to vanity was the creation made subject -- not of its will, but because of Him who did subject [it] -- in hope,
060821 that also the creation itself shall be set free from the servitude of the corruption to the liberty of the glory of the children of God;
060822 for we have known that all the creation doth groan together, and doth travail in pain together till now.
060823 And not only [so], but also we ourselves, having the first-fruit of the Spirit, we also ourselves in ourselves do groan, adoption expecting -- the redemption of our body;
060824 for in hope we were saved, and hope beheld is not hope; for what any one doth behold, why also doth he hope for [it]?
060825 and if what we do not behold we hope for, through continuance we expect [it].
060826 And, in like manner also, the Spirit doth help our weaknesses; for, what we may pray for, as it behoveth [us], we have not known, but the Spirit himself doth make intercession for us with groanings unutterable,
060827 and He who is searching the hearts hath known what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because according to God he doth intercede for saints.
060828 And we have known that to those loving God all things do work together for good, to those who are called according to purpose;
060829 because whom He did foreknow, He also did fore-appoint, conformed to the image of His Son, that he might be first-born among many brethren;
060830 and whom He did fore-appoint, these also He did call; and whom He did call, these also He declared righteous; and whom He declared righteous, these also He did glorify.
060831 What, then, shall we say unto these things? if God [is] for us, who [is] against us?
060832 He who indeed His own Son did not spare, but for us all did deliver him up, how shall He not also with him the all things grant to us?
060833 Who shall lay a charge against the choice ones of God? God [is] He that is declaring righteous,
060834 who [is] he that is condemning? Christ [is] He that died, yea, rather also, was raised up; who is also on the right hand of God -- who also doth intercede for us.
060835 Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
060836 (according as it hath been written -- 'For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long, we were reckoned as sheep of slaughter,')
060837 but in all these we more than conquer, through him who loved us;
060838 for I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor messengers, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
060839 nor things about to be, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of god, that [is] in Christ Jesus our Lord.
060901 Truth I say in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing testimony with me in the Holy Spirit,
060902 that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart --
060903 for I was wishing, I myself, to be anathema from the Christ -- for my brethren, my kindred, according to the flesh,
060904 who are Israelites, whose [is] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises,
060905 whose [are] the fathers, and of whom [is] the Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed to the ages. Amen.
060906 And it is not possible that the word of God hath failed; for not all who [are] of Israel are these Israel;
060907 nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children, but -- 'in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;'
060908 that is, the children of the flesh -- these [are] not children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for seed;
060909 for the word of promise [is] this; 'According to this time I will come, and there shall be to Sarah a son.'
060910 And not only [so], but also Rebecca, having conceived by one -- Isaac our father --
060911 (for they being not yet born, neither having done anything good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to choice, might remain; not of works, but of Him who is calling,) it was said to her --
060912 'The greater shall serve the less;'
060913 according as it hath been written, 'Jacob I did love, and Esau I did hate.'
060914 What, then, shall we say? unrighteousness [is] with God? let it not be!
060915 for to Moses He saith, 'I will do kindness to whom I do kindness, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion;'
060916 so, then -- not of him who is willing, nor of him who is running, but of God who is doing kindness:
060917 for the Writing saith to Pharaoh -- 'For this very thing I did raise thee up, that I might shew in thee My power, and that My name might be declared in all the land;'
060918 so, then, to whom He willeth, He doth kindness, and to whom He willeth, He doth harden.
060919 Thou wilt say, then, to me, 'Why yet doth He find fault? for His counsel who hath resisted?'
060920 nay, but, O man, who art thou that art answering again to God? shall the thing formed say to Him who did form [it], Why me didst thou make thus?
060921 hath not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make the one vessel to honour, and the one to dishonour?
060922 And if God, willing to shew the wrath and to make known His power, did endure, in much long suffering, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,
060923 and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of kindness, that He before prepared for glory, whom also He did call -- us --
060924 not only out of Jews, but also out of nations,
060925 as also in Hosea He saith, 'I will call what [is] not My people -- My people; and her not beloved -- Beloved,
060926 and it shall be -- in the place where it was said to them, Ye [are] not My people; there they shall be called sons of the living God.'
060927 And Isaiah doth cry concerning Israel, 'If the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;
060928 for a matter He is finishing, and is cutting short in righteousness, because a matter cut short will the Lord do upon the land.
060929 and according as Isaiah saith before, 'Except the Lord of Sabaoth did leave to us a seed, as Sodom we had become, and as Gomorrah we had been made like.'
060930 What, then, shall we say? that nations who are not pursuing righteousness did attain to righteousness, and righteousness that [is] of faith,
060931 and Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, at a law of righteousness did not arrive;
060932 wherefore? because -- not by faith, but as by works of law; for they did stumble at the stone of stumbling,
060933 according as it hath been written, 'Lo, I place in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; and every one who is believing thereon shall not be ashamed.'
061001 Brethren, the pleasure indeed of my heart, and my supplication that [is] to God for Israel, is -- for salvation;
061002 for I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge,
061003 for not knowing the righteousness of God, and their own righteousness seeking to establish, to the righteousness of God they did not submit.
061004 For Christ is an end of law for righteousness to every one who is believing,
061005 for Moses doth describe the righteousness that [is] of the law, that, 'The man who did them shall live in them,'
061006 and the righteousness of faith doth thus speak: 'Thou mayest not say in thine heart, Who shall go up to the heaven,' that is, Christ to bring down?
061007 or, 'Who shall go down to the abyss,' that is, Christ out of the dead to bring up.
061008 But what doth it say? 'Nigh thee is the saying -- in thy mouth, and in thy heart:' that is, the saying of the faith, that we preach;
061009 that if thou mayest confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and mayest believe in thy heart that God did raise him out of the dead, thou shalt be saved,
061010 for with the heart doth [one] believe to righteousness, and with the mouth is confession made to salvation;
061011 for the Writing saith, 'Every one who is believing on him shall not be ashamed,'
061012 for there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all [is] rich to all those calling upon Him,
061013 for every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.'
061014 How then shall they call upon [him] in whom they did not believe? and how shall they believe [on him] of whom they did not hear? and how shall they hear apart from one preaching?
061015 and how shall they preach, if they may not be sent? according as it hath been written, 'How beautiful the feet of those proclaiming good tidings of peace, of those proclaiming good tidings of the good things!'
061016 But they were not all obedient to the good tidings, for Isaiah saith, 'Lord, who did give credence to our report?'
061017 so then the faith [is] by a report, and the report through a saying of God,
061018 but I say, Did they not hear? yes, indeed -- 'to all the earth their voice went forth, and to the ends of the habitable world their sayings.'
061019 But I say, Did not Israel know? first Moses saith, 'I will provoke you to jealousy by [that which is] not a nation; by an unintelligent nation I will anger you,'
061020 and Isaiah is very bold, and saith, 'I was found by those not seeking Me; I became manifest to those not inquiring after Me;'
061021 and unto Israel He saith, 'All the day I did stretch out My hands unto a people unbelieving and gainsaying.'
061101 I say, then, Did God cast away His people? let it not be! for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin:
061102 God did not cast away His people whom He knew before; have ye not known -- in Elijah -- what the Writing saith? how he doth plead with God concerning Israel, saying,
061103 'Lord, Thy prophets they did kill, and Thy altars they dug down, and I was left alone, and they seek my life;'
061104 but what saith the divine answer to him? 'I left to Myself seven thousand men, who did not bow a knee to Baal.'
061105 So then also in the present time a remnant according to the choice of grace there hath been;
061106 and if by grace, no more of works, otherwise the grace becometh no more grace; and if of works, it is no more grace, otherwise the work is no more work.
061107 What then? What Israel doth seek after, this it did not obtain, and the chosen did obtain, and the rest were hardened,
061108 according as it hath been written, 'God gave to them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,' -- unto this very day,
061109 and David saith, 'Let their table become for a snare, and for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompense to them;
061110 let their eyes be darkened -- not to behold, and their back do Thou always bow down.'
061111 I say, then, Did they stumble that they might fall? let it not be! but by their fall the salvation [is] to the nations, to arouse them to jealousy;
061112 and if the fall of them [is] the riches of a world, and the diminution of them the riches of nations, how much more the fulness of them?
061113 For to you I speak -- to the nations -- inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle of nations, my ministration I do glorify;
061114 if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh, and shall save some of them,
061115 for if the casting away of them [is] a reconciliation of the world, what the reception -- if not life out of the dead?
061116 and if the first-fruit [is] holy, the lump also; and if the root [is] holy, the branches also.
061117 And if certain of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wast graffed in among them, and a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree didst become --
061118 do not boast against the branches; and if thou dost boast, thou dost not bear the root, but the root thee!
061119 Thou wilt say, then, 'The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in;' right!
061120 by unbelief they were broken off, and thou hast stood by faith; be not high-minded, but be fearing;
061121 for if God the natural branches did not spare -- lest perhaps He also shall not spare thee.
061122 Lo, then, goodness and severity of God -- upon those indeed who fell, severity; and upon thee, goodness, if thou mayest remain in the goodness, otherwise, thou also shalt be cut off.
061123 And those also, if they may not remain in unbelief, shall be graffed in, for God is able again to graff them in;
061124 for if thou, out of the olive tree, wild by nature, wast cut out, and, contrary to nature, wast graffed into a good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who [are] according to nature, be graffed into their own olive tree?
061125 For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this secret -- that ye may not be wise in your own conceits -- that hardness in part to Israel hath happened till the fulness of the nations may come in;
061126 and so all Israel shall be saved, according as it hath been written, 'There shall come forth out of Sion he who is delivering, and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob,
061127 and this to them [is] the covenant from Me, when I may take away their sins.'
061128 As regards, indeed, the good tidings, [they are] enemies on your account; and as regards the choice -- beloved on account of the fathers;
061129 for unrepented of [are] the gifts and the calling of God;
061130 for as ye also once did not believe in God, and now did find kindness by the unbelief of these:
061131 so also these now did not believe, that in your kindness they also may find kindness;
061132 for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief, that to the whole He might do kindness.
061133 O depth of riches, and wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable His judgments, and untraceable His ways!
061134 for who did know the mind of the Lord? or who did become His counsellor?
061135 or who did first give to Him, and it shall be given back to him again?
061136 because of Him, and through Him, and to Him [are] the all things; to Him [is] the glory -- to the ages. Amen.
061201 I call upon you, therefore, brethren, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a sacrifice -- living, sanctified, acceptable to God -- your intelligent service;
061202 and be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, for your proving what [is] the will of God -- the good, and acceptable, and perfect.
061203 For I say, through the grace that was given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think above what it behoveth to think; but to think so as to think wisely, as to each God did deal a measure of faith,
061204 for as in one body we have many members, and all the members have not the same office,
061205 so we, the many, one body are in Christ, and members each one of one another.
061206 And having gifts, different according to the grace that was given to us; whether prophecy -- 'According to the proportion of faith!'
061207 or ministration -- 'In the ministration!' or he who is teaching -- 'In the teaching!'
061208 or he who is exhorting -- 'In the exhortation!' he who is sharing -- 'In simplicity!' he who is leading -- 'In diligence?' he who is doing kindness -- 'In cheerfulness.'
061209 The love unfeigned: abhorring the evil; cleaving to the good;
061210 in the love of brethren, to one another kindly affectioned: in the honour going before one another;
061211 in the diligence not slothful; in the spirit fervent; the Lord serving;
061212 in the hope rejoicing; in the tribulation enduring; in the prayer persevering;
061213 to the necessities of the saints communicating; the hospitality pursuing.
061214 Bless those persecuting you; bless, and curse not;
061215 to rejoice with the rejoicing, and to weep with the weeping,
061216 of the same mind one toward another, not minding the high things, but with the lowly going along; become not wise in your own conceit;
061217 giving back to no one evil for evil; providing right things before all men.
061218 If possible -- so far as in you -- with all men being in peace;
061219 not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it hath been written, 'Vengeance [is] Mine,
061220 I will recompense again, saith the Lord;' if, then, thine enemy doth hunger, feed him; if he doth thirst, give him drink; for this doing, coals of fire thou shalt heap upon his head;
061221 Be not overcome by the evil, but overcome, in the good, the evil.
061301 Let every soul to the higher authorities be subject, for there is no authority except from God, and the authorities existing are appointed by God,
061302 so that he who is setting himself against the authority, against God's ordinance hath resisted; and those resisting, to themselves shall receive judgment.
061303 For those ruling are not a terror to the good works, but to the evil; and dost thou wish not to be afraid of the authority? that which is good be doing, and thou shalt have praise from it,
061304 for of God it is a ministrant to thee for good; and if that which is evil thou mayest do, be fearing, for not in vain doth it bear the sword; for of God it is a ministrant, an avenger for wrath to him who is doing that which is evil.
061305 Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of the wrath, but also because of the conscience,
061306 for because of this also pay ye tribute; for servants of God they are, on this very thing attending continually;
061307 render, therefore, to all [their] dues; to whom tribute, the tribute; to whom custom, the custom; to whom fear, the fear; to whom honour, the honour.
061308 To no one owe anything, except to love one another; for he who is loving the other -- law he hath fulfilled,
061309 for, 'Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false testimony, Thou shalt not covet;' and if there is any other command, in this word it is summed up, in this: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;'
061310 the love to the neighbor doth work no ill; the love, therefore, [is] the fulness of law.
061311 And this, knowing the time, that for us, the hour already [is] to be aroused out of sleep, for now nearer [is] our salvation than when we did believe;
061312 the night did advance, and the day came nigh; let us lay aside, therefore, the works of the darkness, and let us put on the armour of the light;
061313 as in day-time, let us walk becomingly; not in revellings and drunkennesses, not in chamberings and lasciviousnesses, not in strife and emulation;
061314 but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and for the flesh take no forethought -- for desires.
061401 And him who is weak in the faith receive ye -- not to determinations of reasonings;
061402 one doth believe that he may eat all things -- and he who is weak doth eat herbs;
061403 let not him who is eating despise him who is not eating: and let not him who is not eating judge him who is eating, for God did receive him.
061404 Thou -- who art thou that art judging another's domestic? to his own master he doth stand or fall; and he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.
061405 One doth judge one day above another, and another doth judge every day [alike]; let each in his own mind be fully assured.
061406 He who is regarding the day, to the Lord he doth regard [it], and he who is not regarding the day, to the Lord he doth not regard [it]. He who is eating, to the Lord he doth eat, for he doth give thanks to God; and he who is not eating, to the Lord he doth not eat, and doth give thanks to God.
061407 For none of us to himself doth live, and none to himself doth die;
061408 for both, if we may live, to the Lord we live; if also we may die, to the Lord we die; both then if we may live, also if we may die, we are the Lord's;
061409 for because of this Christ both died and rose again, and lived again, that both of dead and of living he may be Lord.
061410 And thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand at the tribunal of the Christ;
061411 for it hath been written, 'I live! saith the Lord -- to Me bow shall every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God;'
061412 so, then, each of us concerning himself shall give reckoning to God;
061413 no longer, therefore, may we judge one another, but this judge ye rather, not to put a stumbling-stone before the brother, or an offence.
061414 I have known, and am persuaded, in the Lord Jesus, that nothing [is] unclean of itself, except to him who is reckoning anything to be unclean -- to that one [it is] unclean;
061415 and if through victuals thy brother is grieved, no more dost thou walk according to love; do not with thy victuals destroy that one for whom Christ died.
061416 Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of,
061417 for the reign of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit;
061418 for he who in these things is serving the Christ, [is] acceptable to God and approved of men.
061419 So, then, the things of peace may we pursue, and the things of building up one another;
061420 for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God; all things, indeed, [are] pure, but evil [is] to the man who is eating through stumbling.
061421 Right [it is] not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to [do anything] in which thy brother doth stumble, or is made to fall, or is weak.
061422 Thou hast faith! to thyself have [it] before God; happy is he who is not judging himself in what he doth approve,
061423 and he who is making a difference, if he may eat, hath been condemned, because [it is] not of faith; and all that [is] not of faith is sin.
061501 And we ought -- we who are strong -- to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves;
061502 for let each one of us please the neighbor for good, unto edification,
061503 for even the Christ did not please himself, but, according as it hath been written, 'The reproaches of those reproaching Thee fell upon me;'
061504 for, as many things as were written before, for our instruction were written before, that through the endurance, and the exhortation of the Writings, we might have the hope.
061505 And may the God of the endurance, and of the exhortation, give to you to have the same mind toward one another, according to Christ Jesus;
061506 that with one accord -- with one mouth -- ye may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;
061507 wherefore receive ye one another, according as also the Christ did receive us, to the glory of God.
061508 And I say Jesus Christ to have become a ministrant of circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises to the fathers,
061509 and the nations for kindness to glorify God, according as it hath been written, 'Because of this I will confess to Thee among nations, and to Thy name I will sing praise,'
061510 and again it saith, 'Rejoice ye nations, with His people;'
061511 and again, 'Praise the Lord, all ye nations; and laud Him, all ye peoples;'
061512 and again, Isaiah saith, 'There shall be the root of Jesse, and he who is rising to rule nations -- upon him shall nations hope;'
061513 and the God of the hope shall fill you with all joy and peace in the believing, for your abounding in the hope in power of the Holy Spirit.
061514 And I am persuaded, my brethren -- I myself also -- concerning you, that ye yourselves also are full of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, able also one another to admonish;
061515 and the more boldly I did write to you, brethren, in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me by God,
061516 for my being a servant of Jesus Christ to the nations, acting as priest in the good news of God, that the offering up of the nations may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
061517 I have, then, a boasting in Christ Jesus, in the things pertaining to God,
061518 for I will not dare to speak anything of the things that Christ did not work through me, to obedience of nations, by word and deed,
061519 in power of signs and wonders, in power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circle as far as Illyricum, have fully preached the good news of the Christ;
061520 and so counting it honour to proclaim good news, not where Christ was named -- that upon another's foundation I might not build --
061521 but according as it hath been written, 'To whom it was not told concerning him, they shall see; and they who have not heard, shall understand.'
061522 Wherefore, also, I was hindered many times from coming unto you,
061523 and now, no longer having place in these parts, and having a longing to come unto you for many years,
061524 when I may go on to Spain I will come unto you, for I hope in going through, to see you, and by you to be set forward thither, if of you first, in part, I shall be filled.
061525 And, now, I go on to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;
061526 for it pleased Macedonia and Achaia well to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who [are] in Jerusalem;
061527 for it pleased well, and their debtors they are, for if in their spiritual things the nations did participate, they ought also, in the fleshly things, to minister to them.
061528 This, then, having finished, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will return through you, to Spain;
061529 and I have known that coming unto you -- in the fulness of the blessing of the good news of Christ I shall come.
061530 And I call upon you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in the prayers for me unto God,
061531 that I may be delivered from those not believing in Judea, and that my ministration, that [is] for Jerusalem, may become acceptable to the saints;
061532 that in joy I may come unto you, through the will of God, and may be refreshed with you,
061533 and the God of the peace [be] with you all. Amen.
061601 And I commend you to Phebe our sister -- being a ministrant of the assembly that [is] in Cenchrea --
061602 that ye may receive her in the Lord, as doth become saints, and may assist her in whatever matter she may have need of you -- for she also became a leader of many, and of myself.
061603 Salute Priscilla and Aquilas, my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus --
061604 who for my life their own neck did lay down, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the nations --
061605 and the assembly at their house; salute Epaenetus, my beloved, who is first-fruit of Achaia to Christ.
061606 Salute Mary, who did labour much for us;
061607 salute Andronicus and Junias, my kindred, and my fellow-captives, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me.
061608 Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord;
061609 salute Arbanus, our fellow-workman in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved;
061610 salute Apelles, the approved in Christ; salute those of the [household] of Aristobulus;
061611 salute Herodion, my kinsman; salute those of the [household] of Narcissus, who are in the Lord;
061612 salute Tryphaena, and Tryphosa, who are labouring in the Lord; salute Persis, the beloved, who did labour much in the Lord.
061613 Salute Rufus, the choice one in the Lord, and his mother and mine,
061614 salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren with them;
061615 salute Philologus, and Julias, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them;
061616 salute one another in a holy kiss; the assemblies of Christ do salute you.
061617 And I call upon you, brethren, to mark those who the divisions and the stumbling-blocks, contrary to the teaching that ye did learn, are causing, and turn ye away from them;
061618 for such our Lord Jesus Christ do not serve, but their own belly; and through the good word and fair speech they deceive the hearts of the harmless,
061619 for your obedience did reach to all; I rejoice, therefore, as regards you, and I wish you to be wise, indeed, as to the good, and harmless as to the evil;
061620 and the God of the peace shall bruise the Adversary under your feet quickly; the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen!
061621 Salute you do Timotheus, my fellow-workman, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kindred;
061622 I Tertius salute you (who wrote the letter) in the Lord;
061623 salute you doth Gaius, my host, and of the whole assembly; salute you doth Erastus, the steward of the city, and Quartus the brother,
061624 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.
061625 And to Him who is able to establish you, according to my good news, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the secret, in the times of the ages having been kept silent,
061626 and now having been made manifest, also, through prophetic writings, according to a command of the age-during God, having been made known to all the nations for obedience of faith --
061627 to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to him [be] glory to the ages. Amen.
070101 Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,
070102 to the assembly of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place -- both theirs and ours:
070103 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!
070104 I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus,
070105 that in every thing ye were enriched in him, in all discourse and all knowledge,
070106 according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in you,
070107 so that ye are not behind in any gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
070108 who also shall confirm you unto the end -- unblamable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ;
070109 faithful [is] God, through whom ye were called to the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
070110 And I call upon you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that the same thing ye may all say, and there may not be divisions among you, and ye may be perfected in the same mind, and in the same judgment,
070111 for it was signified to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe, that contentions are among you;
070112 and I say this, that each one of you saith, 'I, indeed, am of Paul' -- 'and I of Apollos,' -- 'and I of Cephas,' -- 'and I of Christ.'
070113 Hath the Christ been divided? was Paul crucified for you? or to the name of Paul were ye baptized;
070114 I give thanks to God that no one of you did I baptize, except Crispus and Gaius --
070115 that no one may say that to my own name I did baptize;
070116 and I did baptize also Stephanas' household -- further, I have not known if I did baptize any other.
070117 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but -- to proclaim good news; not in wisdom of discourse, that the cross of the Christ may not be made of none effect;
070118 for the word of the cross to those indeed perishing is foolishness, and to us -- those being saved -- it is the power of God,
070119 for it hath been written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nought;'
070120 where [is] the wise? where the scribe? where a disputer of this age? did not God make foolish the wisdom of this world?
070121 for, seeing in the wisdom of God the world through the wisdom knew not God, it did please God through the foolishness of the preaching to save those believing.
070122 Since also Jews ask a sign, and Greeks seek wisdom,
070123 also we -- we preach Christ crucified, to Jews, indeed, a stumbling-block, and to Greeks foolishness,
070124 and to those called -- both Jews and Greeks -- Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God,
070125 because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men;
070126 for see your calling, brethren, that not many [are] wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;
070127 but the foolish things of the world did God choose, that the wise He may put to shame; and the weak things of the world did God choose that He may put to shame the strong;
070128 and the base things of the world, and the things despised did God choose, and the things that are not, that the things that are He may make useless --
070129 that no flesh may glory before Him;
070130 and of Him ye -- ye are in Christ Jesus, who became to us from God wisdom, righteousness also, and sanctification, and redemption,
070131 that, according as it hath been written, 'He who is glorying -- in the Lord let him glory.'
070201 And I, having come unto you, brethren, came -- not in superiority of discourse or wisdom -- declaring to you the testimony of God,
070202 for I decided not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified;
070203 and I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, was with you;
070204 and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power --
070205 that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
070206 And wisdom we speak among the perfect, and wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age -- of those becoming useless,
070207 but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret, that God foreordained before the ages to our glory,
070208 which no one of the rulers of this age did know, for if they had known, the Lord of the glory they would not have crucified;
070209 but, according as it hath been written, 'What eye did not see, and ear did not hear, and upon the heart of man came not up, what God did prepare for those loving Him --'
070210 but to us did God reveal [them] through His Spirit, for the Spirit all things doth search, even the depths of God,
070211 for who of men hath known the things of the man, except the spirit of the man that [is] in him? so also the things of God no one hath known, except the Spirit of God.
070212 And we the spirit of the world did not receive, but the Spirit that [is] of God, that we may know the things conferred by God on us,
070213 which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, with spiritual things spiritual things comparing,
070214 and the natural man doth not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for to him they are foolishness, and he is not able to know [them], because spiritually they are discerned;
070215 and he who is spiritual, doth discern indeed all things, and he himself is by no one discerned;
070216 for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall instruct Him? and we -- we have the mind of Christ.
070301 And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly -- as to babes in Christ;
070302 with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for ye were not yet able, but not even yet are ye now able,
070303 for yet ye are fleshly, for where [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and in the manner of men do walk?
070304 for when one may say, 'I, indeed, am of Paul;' and another, 'I -- of Apollos;' are ye not fleshly?
070305 Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom ye did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?
070306 I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;
070307 so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth -- God;
070308 and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,
070309 for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage, God's building ye are.
070310 According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another doth build on [it],
070311 for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;
070312 and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw --
070313 of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare [it], because in fire it is revealed, and the work of each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove;
070314 if of any one the work doth remain that he built on [it], a wage he shall receive;
070315 if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.
070316 have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God doth dwell in you?
070317 if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which ye are.
070318 Let no one deceive himself; if any one doth seem to be wise among you in this age -- let him become a fool, that he may become wise,
070319 for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it hath been written, 'Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;'
070320 and again, 'The Lord doth know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.'
070321 So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,
070322 whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be -- all are yours,
070323 and ye [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.
070401 Let a man so reckon us as officers of Christ, and stewards of the secrets of God,
070402 and as to the rest, it is required in the stewards that one may be found faithful,
070403 and to me it is for a very little thing that by you I may be judged, or by man's day, but not even myself do I judge,
070404 for of nothing to myself have I been conscious, but not in this have I been declared right -- and he who is discerning me is the Lord:
070405 so, then, nothing before the time judge ye, till the Lord may come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of the darkness, and will manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then the praise shall come to each from God.
070406 And these things, brethren, I did transfer to myself and to Apollos because of you, that in us ye may learn not to think above that which hath been written, that ye may not be puffed up one for one against the other,
070407 for who doth make thee to differ? and what hast thou, that thou didst not receive? and if thou didst also receive, why dost thou glory as not having received?
070408 Already ye are having been filled, already ye were rich, apart from us ye did reign, and I would also ye did reign, that we also with you may reign together,
070409 for I think that God did set forth us the apostles last -- as appointed to death, because a spectacle we became to the world, and messengers, and men;
070410 we [are] fools because of Christ, and ye wise in Christ; we [are] ailing, and ye strong; ye glorious, and we dishonoured;
070411 unto the present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and wander about,
070412 and labour, working with [our] own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer;
070413 being spoken evil of, we entreat; as filth of the world we did become -- of all things an offscouring -- till now.
070414 Not [as] putting you to shame do I write these things, but as my beloved children I do admonish,
070415 for if a myriad of child-conductors ye may have in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, through the good news, I -- I did beget you;
070416 I call upon you, therefore, become ye followers of me;
070417 because of this I sent to you Timotheus, who is my child, beloved and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways in Christ, according as everywhere in every assembly I teach.
070418 And as if I were not coming unto you certain were puffed up;
070419 but I will come quickly unto you, if the Lord may will, and I will know not the word of those puffed up, but the power;
070420 for not in word is the reign of God, but in power?
070421 what do ye wish? with a rod shall I come unto you, or in love, with a spirit also of meekness?
070501 Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations -- as that one hath the wife of the father! --
070502 and ye are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work,
070503 for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who so wrought this thing:
070504 in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ -- ye being gathered together, also my spirit -- with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
070505 to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
070506 Not good [is] your glorying; have ye not known that a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven?
070507 cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened, for also our passover for us was sacrificed -- Christ,
070508 so that we may keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened food of sincerity and truth.
070509 I did write to you in the epistle, not to keep company with whoremongers --
070510 and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing ye ought then to go forth out of the world --
070511 and now, I did write to you not to keep company with [him], if any one, being named a brother, may be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner -- with such a one not even to eat together;
070512 for what have I also those without to judge? those within do ye not judge?
070513 and those without God doth judge; and put ye away the evil from among yourselves.
070601 Dare any one of you, having a matter with the other, go to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
070602 have ye not known that the saints shall judge the world? and if by you the world is judged, are ye unworthy of the smaller judgments?
070603 have ye not known that we shall judge messengers? why not then the things of life?
070604 of the things of life, indeed, then, if ye may have judgment, those despised in the assembly -- these cause ye to sit;
070605 unto your shame I speak: so there is not among you one wise man, not even one, who shall be able to discern in the midst of his brethren!
070606 but brother with brother doth go to be judged, and this before unbelievers!
070607 Already, indeed, then, there is altogether a fault among you, that ye have judgments with one another; wherefore do ye not rather suffer injustice? wherefore be ye not rather defrauded?
070608 but ye -- ye do injustice, and ye defraud, and these -- brethren!
070609 have ye not known that the unrighteous the reign of God shall not inherit? be not led astray; neither whoremongers, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,
070610 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, the reign of God shall inherit.
070611 And certain of you were these! but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were declared righteous, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.
070612 All things are lawful to me, but all things are not profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I -- I will not be under authority by any;
070613 the meats [are] for the belly, and the belly for the meats. And God both this and these shall make useless; and the body [is] not for whoredom, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;
070614 and God both the Lord did raise, and us will raise up through His power.
070615 Have ye not known that your bodies are members of Christ? having taken, then, the members of the Christ, shall I make [them] members of an harlot? let it be not!
070616 have ye not known that he who is joined to the harlot is one body? 'for they shall be -- saith He -- the two for one flesh.'
070617 And he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit;
070618 flee the whoredom; every sin -- whatever a man may commit -- is without the body, and he who is committing whoredom, against his own body doth sin.
070619 Have ye not known that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own,
070620 for ye were bought with a price; glorify, then, God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
070701 And concerning the things of which ye wrote to me: good [it is] for a man not to touch a woman,
070702 and because of the whoredom let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her proper husband;
070703 to the wife let the husband the due benevolence render, and in like manner also the wife to the husband;
070704 the wife over her own body hath not authority, but the husband; and, in like manner also, the husband over his own body hath not authority, but the wife.
070705 Defraud not one another, except by consent for a time, that ye may be free for fasting and prayer, and again may come together, that the Adversary may not tempt you because of your incontinence;
070706 and this I say by way of concurrence -- not of command,
070707 for I wish all men to be even as I myself [am]; but each his own gift hath of God, one indeed thus, and one thus.
070708 And I say to the unmarried and to the widows: it is good for them if they may remain even as I [am];
070709 and if they have not continence -- let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn;
070710 and to the married I announce -- not I, but the Lord -- let not a wife separate from a husband:
070711 but and if she may separate, let her remain unmarried, or to the husband let her be reconciled, and let not a husband send away a wife.
070712 And to the rest I speak -- not the Lord -- if any brother hath a wife unbelieving, and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not send her away;
070713 and a woman who hath a husband unbelieving, and he is pleased to dwell with her, let her not send him away;
070714 for the unbelieving husband hath been sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife hath been sanctified in the husband; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.
070715 And, if the unbelieving doth separate himself -- let him separate himself: the brother or the sister is not under servitude in such [cases], and in peace hath God called us;
070716 for what, hast thou known, O wife, whether the husband thou shalt save? or what, hast thou known, O husband, whether the wife thou shalt save?
070717 if not, as God did distribute to each, as the Lord hath called each -- so let him walk; and thus in all the assemblies do I direct:
070718 being circumcised -- was any one called? let him not become uncircumcised; in uncircumcision was any one called? let him not be circumcised;
070719 the circumcision is nothing, and the uncircumcision is nothing -- but a keeping of the commands of God.
070720 Each in the calling in which he was called -- in this let him remain;
070721 a servant -- wast thou called? be not anxious; but if also thou art able to become free -- use [it] rather;
070722 for he who [is] in the Lord -- having been called a servant -- is the Lord's freedman: in like manner also he the freeman, having been called, is servant of Christ:
070723 with a price ye were bought, become not servants of men;
070724 each, in that in which he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.
070725 And concerning the virgins, a command of the Lord I have not; and I give judgment as having obtained kindness from the Lord to be faithful:
070726 I suppose, therefore, this to be good because of the present necessity, that [it is] good for a man that the matter be thus: --
070727 Hast thou been bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; hast thou been loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
070728 But and if thou mayest marry, thou didst not sin; and if the virgin may marry, she did not sin; and such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I spare you.
070729 And this I say, brethren, the time henceforth is having been shortened -- that both those having wives may be as not having;
070730 and those weeping, as not weeping; and those rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and those buying, as not possessing;
070731 and those using this world, as not using [it] up; for passing away is the fashion of this world.
070732 And I wish you to be without anxiety; the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;
070733 and the married is anxious for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.
070734 The wife and the virgin have been distinguished: the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit, and the married is anxious for the things of the world, how she shall please the husband.
070735 And this for your own profit I say: not that I may cast a noose upon you, but for the seemliness and devotedness to the Lord, undistractedly,
070736 and if any one doth think [it] to be unseemly to his virgin, if she may be beyond the bloom of age, and it ought so to be, what he willeth let him do; he doth not sin -- let him marry.
070737 And he who hath stood stedfast in the heart -- not having necessity -- and hath authority over his own will, and this he hath determined in his heart -- to keep his own virgin -- doth well;
070738 so that both he who is giving in marriage doth well, and he who is not giving in marriage doth better.
070739 A wife hath been bound by law as long time as her husband may live, and if her husband may sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will -- only in the Lord;
070740 and she is happier if she may so remain -- according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God.
070801 And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffeth up, but love buildeth up;
070802 and if any one doth think to know anything, he hath not yet known anything according as it behoveth [him] to know;
070803 and if any one doth love God, this one hath been known by Him.
070804 Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one;
070805 for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon earth -- as there are gods many and lords many --
070806 yet to us [is] one God, the Father, of whom [are] the all things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom [are] the all things, and we through Him;
070807 but not in all men [is] the knowledge, and certain with conscience of the idol, till now, as a thing sacrificed to an idol do eat [it], and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
070808 But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind;
070809 but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a stumbling-block to the infirm,
070810 for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an idol's temple reclining at meat -- shall not his conscience -- he being infirm -- be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols,
070811 and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy knowledge, because of whom Christ died?
070812 and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting their weak conscience -- in regard to Christ ye sin;
070813 wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may eat no flesh -- to the age -- that my brother I may not cause to stumble.
070901 Am not I an apostle? am not I free? Jesus Christ our Lord have I not seen? my work are not ye in the Lord?
070902 if to others I am not an apostle -- yet doubtless to you I am; for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord.
070903 My defence to those who examine me in this;
070904 have we not authority to eat and to drink?
070905 have we not authority a sister -- a wife -- to lead about, as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
070906 or only I and Barnabas, have we not authority -- not to work?
070907 who doth serve as a soldier at his own charges at any time? who doth plant a vineyard, and of its fruit doth not eat? or who doth feed a flock, and of the milk of the flock doth not eat?
070908 According to man do I speak these things? or doth not also the law say these things?
070909 for in the law of Moses it hath been written, 'thou shalt not muzzle an ox treading out corn;' for the oxen doth God care?
070910 or because of us by all means doth He say [it]? yes, because of us it was written, because in hope ought the plower to plow, and he who is treading [ought] of his hope to partake in hope.
070911 If we to you the spiritual things did sow -- great [is it] if we your fleshly things do reap?
070912 if others do partake of the authority over you -- not we more? but we did not use this authority, but all things we bear, that we may give no hindrance to the good news of the Christ.
070913 Have ye not known that those working about the things of the temple -- of the temple do eat, and those waiting at the altar -- with the altar are partakers?
070914 so also did the Lord direct to those proclaiming the good news: of the good news to live.
070915 And I have used none of these things; neither did I write these things that it may be so done in my case, for [it is] good for me rather to die, than that any one may make my glorying void;
070916 for if I may proclaim good news, it is no glorying for me, for necessity is laid upon me, and wo is to me if I may not proclaim good news;
070917 for if willing I do this, I have a reward; and if unwillingly -- with a stewardship I have been entrusted!
070918 What, then, is my reward? -- that proclaiming good news, without charge I shall make the good news of the Christ, not to abuse my authority in the good news;
070919 for being free from all men, to all men I made myself servant, that the more I might gain;
070920 and I became to the Jews as a Jew, that Jews I might gain; to those under law as under law, that those under law I might gain;
070921 to those without law, as without law -- (not being without law to God, but within law to Christ) -- that I might gain those without law;
070922 I became to the infirm as infirm, that the infirm I might gain; to all men I have become all things, that by all means I may save some.
070923 And this I do because of the good news, that a fellow-partaker of it I may become;
070924 have ye not known that those running in a race -- all indeed run, but one doth receive the prize? so run ye, that ye may obtain;
070925 and every one who is striving, is in all things temperate; these, indeed, then, that a corruptible crown they may receive, but we an incorruptible;
070926 I, therefore, thus run, not as uncertainly, thus I fight, as not beating air;
070927 but I chastise my body, and bring [it] into servitude, lest by any means, having preached to others -- I myself may become disapproved.
071001 And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,
071002 and all to Moses were baptized in the cloud, and in the sea;
071003 and all the same spiritual food did eat,
071004 and all the same spiritual drink did drink, for they were drinking of a spiritual rock following them, and the rock was the Christ;
071005 but in the most of them God was not well pleased, for they were strewn in the wilderness,
071006 and those things became types of us, for our not passionately desiring evil things, as also these did desire.
071007 Neither become ye idolaters, as certain of them, as it hath been written, 'The people sat down to eat and to drink, and stood up to play;'
071008 neither may we commit whoredom, as certain of them did commit whoredom, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand;
071009 neither may we tempt the Christ, as also certain of them did tempt, and by the serpents did perish;
071010 neither murmur ye, as also some of them did murmur, and did perish by the destroyer.
071011 And all these things as types did happen to those persons, and they were written for our admonition, to whom the end of the ages did come,
071012 so that he who is thinking to stand -- let him observe, lest he fall.
071013 No temptation hath taken you -- except human; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able, but He will make, with the temptation, also the outlet, for your being able to bear [it].
071014 Wherefore, my beloved, flee from the idolatry;
071015 as to wise men I speak -- judge ye what I say:
071016 The cup of the blessing that we bless -- is it not the fellowship of the blood of the Christ? the bread that we break -- is it not the fellowship of the body of the Christ?
071017 because one bread, one body, are we the many -- for we all of the one bread do partake.
071018 See Israel according to the flesh! are not those eating the sacrifices in the fellowship of the altar?
071019 what then do I say? that an idol is anything? or that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything? --
071020 [no,] but that the things that the nations sacrifice -- they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not wish you to come into the fellowship of the demons.
071021 Ye are not able the cup of the Lord to drink, and the cup of demons; ye are not able of the table of the Lord to partake, and of the table of demons;
071022 do we arouse the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than He?
071023 All things to me are lawful, but all things are not profitable; all things to me are lawful, but all things do not build up;
071024 let no one seek his own -- but each another's.
071025 Whatever in the meat-market is sold eat ye, not inquiring, because of the conscience,
071026 for the Lord's [is] the earth, and its fulness;
071027 and if any one of the unbelieving do call you, and ye wish to go, all that is set before you eat, nothing inquiring, because of the conscience;
071028 and if any one may say to you, 'This is a thing sacrificed to an idol,' -- do not eat, because of that one who shewed [it], and of the conscience, for the Lord's [is] the earth and its fulness:
071029 and conscience, I say, not of thyself, but of the other, for why [is it] that my liberty is judged by another's conscience?
071030 and if I thankfully do partake, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks?
071031 Whether, then, ye eat, or drink, or do anything, do all to the glory of God;
071032 become offenceless, both to Jews and Greeks, and to the assembly of God;
071033 as I also in all things do please all, not seeking my own profit, but that of many -- that they may be saved.
071101 Followers of me become ye, as I also [am] of Christ.
071102 And I praise you, brethren, that in all things ye remember me, and according as I did deliver to you, the deliverances ye keep,
071103 and I wish you to know that of every man the head is the Christ, and the head of a woman is the husband, and the head of Christ is God.
071104 Every man praying or prophesying, having the head covered, doth dishonour his head,
071105 and every woman praying or prophesying with the head uncovered, doth dishonour her own head, for it is one and the same thing with her being shaven,
071106 for if a woman is not covered -- then let her be shorn, and if [it is] a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven -- let her be covered;
071107 for a man, indeed, ought not to cover the head, being the image and glory of God, and a woman is the glory of a man,
071108 for a man is not of a woman, but a woman [is] of a man,
071109 for a man also was not created because of the woman, but a woman because of the man;
071110 because of this the woman ought to have [a token of] authority upon the head, because of the messengers;
071111 but neither [is] a man apart from a woman, nor a woman apart from a man, in the Lord,
071112 for as the woman [is] of the man, so also the man [is] through the woman, and the all things [are] of God.
071113 In your own selves judge ye; is it seemly for a woman uncovered to pray to God?
071114 doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man indeed have long hair, a dishonour it is to him?
071115 and a woman, if she have long hair, a glory it is to her, because the hair instead of a covering hath been given to her;
071116 and if any one doth think to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the assemblies of God.
071117 And this declaring, I give no praise, because not for the better, but for the worse ye come together;
071118 for first, indeed, ye coming together in an assembly, I hear of divisions being among you, and partly I believe [it],
071119 for it behoveth sects also to be among you, that those approved may become manifest among you;
071120 ye, then, coming together at the same place -- it is not to eat the Lord's supper;
071121 for each his own supper doth take before in the eating, and one is hungry, and another is drunk;
071122 why, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or the assembly of God do ye despise, and shame those not having? what may I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I do not praise!
071123 For I -- I received from the Lord that which also I did deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,
071124 and having given thanks, he brake, and said, 'Take ye, eat ye, this is my body, that for you is being broken; this do ye -- to the remembrance of me.'
071125 In like manner also the cup after the supping, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye may drink [it] -- to the remembrance of me;'
071126 for as often as ye may eat this bread, and this cup may drink, the death of the Lord ye do shew forth -- till he may come;
071127 so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, guilty he shall be of the body and blood of the Lord:
071128 and let a man be proving himself, and so of the bread let him eat, and of the cup let him drink;
071129 for he who is eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to himself he doth eat and drink -- not discerning the body of the Lord.
071130 Because of this, among you many [are] weak and sickly, and sleep do many;
071131 for if ourselves we were discerning, we would not be being judged,
071132 and being judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that with the world we may not be condemned;
071133 so then, my brethren, coming together to eat, for one another wait ye;
071134 and if any one is hungry, at home let him eat, that to judgment ye may not come together; and the rest, whenever I may come, I shall arrange.
071201 And concerning the spiritual things, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant;
071202 ye have known that ye were nations, unto the dumb idols -- as ye were led -- being carried away;
071203 wherefore, I give you to understand that no one, in the Spirit of God speaking, saith Jesus [is] anathema, and no one is able to say Jesus [is] Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.
071204 And there are diversities of gifts, and the same Spirit;
071205 and there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord;
071206 and there are diversities of workings, and it is the same God -- who is working the all in all.
071207 And to each hath been given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit;
071208 for to one through the Spirit hath been given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;
071209 and to another faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings in the same Spirit;
071210 and to another in-workings of mighty deeds; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another [divers] kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:
071211 and all these doth work the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each severally as he intendeth.
071212 For, even as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so also [is] the Christ,
071213 for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or freemen, and all into one Spirit were made to drink,
071214 for also the body is not one member, but many;
071215 if the foot may say, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body;' it is not, because of this, not of the body;
071216 and if the ear may say, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body;' it is not, because of this, not of the body?
071217 If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if the whole hearing, where the smelling?
071218 and now, God did set the members each one of them in the body, according as He willed,
071219 and if all were one member, where the body?
071220 and now, indeed, [are] many members, and one body;
071221 and an eye is not able to say to the hand, 'I have no need of thee;' nor again the head to the feet, 'I have no need of you.'
071222 But much more the members of the body which seem to be more infirm are necessary,
071223 and those that we think to be less honourable of the body, around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly things have seemliness more abundant,
071224 and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant honour,
071225 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same anxiety for one another,
071226 and whether one member doth suffer, suffer with [it] do all the members, or one member is glorified, rejoice with [it] do all the members;
071227 and ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
071228 And some, indeed, did God set in the assembly, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, afterwards powers, afterwards gifts of healings, helpings, governings, divers kinds of tongues;
071229 [are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all powers?
071230 have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
071231 and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far excelling way do I shew to you:
071301 If with the tongues of men and of messengers I speak, and have not love, I have become brass sounding, or a cymbal tinkling;
071302 and if I have prophecy, and know all the secrets, and all the knowledge, and if I have all the faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing;
071303 and if I give away to feed others all my goods, and if I give up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.
071304 The love is long-suffering, it is kind, the love doth not envy, the love doth not vaunt itself, is not puffed up,
071305 doth not act unseemly, doth not seek its own things, is not provoked, doth not impute evil,
071306 rejoiceth not over the unrighteousness, and rejoiceth with the truth;
071307 all things it beareth, all it believeth, all it hopeth, all it endureth.
071308 The love doth never fail; and whether [there be] prophecies, they shall become useless; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall become useless;
071309 for in part we know, and in part we prophecy;
071310 and when that which is perfect may come, then that which [is] in part shall become useless.
071311 When I was a babe, as a babe I was speaking, as a babe I was thinking, as a babe I was reasoning, and when I have become a man, I have made useless the things of the babe;
071312 for we see now through a mirror obscurely, and then face to face; now I know in part, and then I shall fully know, as also I was known;
071313 and now there doth remain faith, hope, love -- these three; and the greatest of these [is] love.
071401 Pursue the love, and seek earnestly the spiritual things, and rather that ye may prophecy,
071402 for he who is speaking in an [unknown] tongue -- to men he doth not speak, but to God, for no one doth hearken, and in spirit he doth speak secrets;
071403 and he who is prophesying to men doth speak edification, and exhortation, and comfort;
071404 he who is speaking in an [unknown] tongue, himself doth edify, and he who is prophesying, an assembly doth edify;
071405 and I wish you all to speak with tongues, and more that ye may prophecy, for greater is he who is prophesying than he who is speaking with tongues, except one may interpret, that the assembly may receive edification.
071406 And now, brethren, if I may come unto you speaking tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophesying, or in teaching?
071407 yet the things without life giving sound -- whether pipe or harp -- if a difference in the sounds they may not give, how shall be known that which is piped or that which is harped?
071408 for if also an uncertain sound a trumpet may give, who shall prepare himself for battle?
071409 so also ye, if through the tongue, speech easily understood ye may not give -- how shall that which is spoken be known? for ye shall be speaking to air.
071410 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is unmeaning,
071411 if, then, I do not know the power of the voice, I shall be to him who is speaking a foreigner, and he who is speaking, is to me a foreigner;
071412 so also ye, since ye are earnestly desirous of spiritual gifts, for the building up of the assembly seek that ye may abound;
071413 wherefore he who is speaking in an [unknown] tongue -- let him pray that he may interpret;
071414 for if I pray in an [unknown] tongue, my spirit doth pray, and my understanding is unfruitful.
071415 What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing psalms with the spirit, and I will sing psalms also with the understanding;
071416 since, if thou mayest bless with the spirit, he who is filling the place of the unlearned, how shall he say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, since what thou dost say he hath not known?
071417 for thou, indeed, dost give thanks well, but the other is not built up!
071418 I give thanks to my God -- more than you all with tongues speaking --
071419 but in an assembly I wish to speak five words through my understanding, that others also I may instruct, rather than myriads of words in an [unknown] tongue.
071420 Brethren, become not children in the understanding, but in the evil be ye babes, and in the understanding become ye perfect;
071421 in the law it hath been written, that, 'With other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people, and not even so will they hear Me, saith the Lord;'
071422 so that the tongues are for a sign, not to the believing, but to the unbelieving; and the prophesy [is] not for the unbelieving, but for the believing,
071423 If, therefore, the whole assembly may come together, to the same place, and all may speak with tongues, and there may come in unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
071424 and if all may prophecy, and any one may come in, an unbeliever or unlearned, he is convicted by all, he is discerned by all,
071425 and so the secrets of his heart become manifest, and so having fallen upon [his] face, he will bow before God, declaring that God really is among you.
071426 What then is it, brethren? whenever ye may come together, each of you hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation? let all things be for building up;
071427 if an [unknown] tongue any one do speak, by two, or at the most, by three, and in turn, and let one interpret;
071428 and if there may be no interpreter, let him be silent in an assembly, and to himself let him speak, and to God.
071429 And prophets -- let two or three speak, and let the others discern,
071430 and if to another sitting [anything] may be revealed, let the first be silent;
071431 for ye are able, one by one, all to prophesy, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted,
071432 and the spiritual gift of prophets to prophets are subject,
071433 for God is not [a God] of tumult, but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.
071434 Your women in the assemblies let them be silent, for it hath not been permitted to them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith;
071435 and if they wish to learn anything, at home their own husbands let them question, for it is a shame to women to speak in an assembly.
071436 From you did the word of God come forth? or to you alone did it come?
071437 if any one doth think to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge the things that I write to you -- that of the Lord they are commands;
071438 and if any one is ignorant -- let him be ignorant;
071439 so that, brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and to speak with tongues do not forbid;
071440 let all things be done decently and in order.
071501 And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that I proclaimed to you, which also ye did receive, in which also ye have stood,
071502 through which also ye are being saved, in what words I proclaimed good news to you, if ye hold fast, except ye did believe in vain,
071503 for I delivered to you first, what also I did receive, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Writings,
071504 and that he was buried, and that he hath risen on the third day, according to the Writings,
071505 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve,
071506 afterwards he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain till now, and certain also did fall asleep;
071507 afterwards he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
071508 And last of all -- as to the untimely birth -- he appeared also to me,
071509 for I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I did persecute the assembly of God,
071510 and by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace that [is] towards me came not in vain, but more abundantly than they all did I labour, yet not I, but the grace of God that [is] with me;
071511 whether, then, I or they, so we preach, and so ye did believe.
071512 And if Christ is preached, that out of the dead he hath risen, how say certain among you, that there is no rising again of dead persons?
071513 and if there be no rising again of dead persons, neither hath Christ risen;
071514 and if Christ hath not risen, then void [is] our preaching, and void also your faith,
071515 and we also are found false witnesses of God, because we did testify of God that He raised up the Christ, whom He did not raise if then dead persons do not rise;
071516 for if dead persons do not rise, neither hath Christ risen,
071517 and if Christ hath not risen, vain is your faith, ye are yet in your sins;
071518 then, also, those having fallen asleep in Christ did perish;
071519 if in this life we have hope in Christ only, of all men we are most to be pitied.
071520 And now, Christ hath risen out of the dead -- the first-fruits of those sleeping he became,
071521 for since through man [is] the death, also through man [is] a rising again of the dead,
071522 for even as in Adam all die, so also in the Christ all shall be made alive,
071523 and each in his proper order, a first-fruit Christ, afterwards those who are the Christ's, in his presence,
071524 then -- the end, when he may deliver up the reign to God, even the Father, when he may have made useless all rule, and all authority and power --
071525 for it behoveth him to reign till he may have put all the enemies under his feet --
071526 the last enemy is done away -- death;
071527 for all things He did put under his feet, and, when one may say that all things have been subjected, [it is] evident that He is excepted who did subject the all things to him,
071528 and when the all things may be subjected to him, then the Son also himself shall be subject to Him, who did subject to him the all things, that God may be the all in all.
071529 Seeing what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? why also are they baptized for the dead?
071530 why also do we stand in peril every hour?
071531 Every day do I die, by the glorying of you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord:
071532 if after the manner of a man with wild beasts I fought in Ephesus, what the advantage to me if the dead do not rise? let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die!
071533 Be not led astray; evil communications corrupt good manners;
071534 awake up, as is right, and sin not; for certain have an ignorance of God; for shame to you I say [it].
071535 But some one will say, 'How do the dead rise?
071536 unwise! thou -- what thou dost sow is not quickened except it may die;
071537 and that which thou dost sow, not the body that shall be dost thou sow, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some one of the others,
071538 and God doth give to it a body according as He willed, and to each of the seeds its proper body.
071539 All flesh [is] not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of birds;
071540 and [there are] heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but one [is] the glory of the heavenly, and another that of the earthly;
071541 one glory of sun, and another glory of moon, and another glory of stars, for star from star doth differ in glory.
071542 So also [is] the rising again of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;
071543 it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
071544 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body;
071545 so also it hath been written, 'The first man Adam became a living creature,' the last Adam [is] for a life-giving spirit,
071546 but that which is spiritual [is] not first, but that which [was] natural, afterwards that which [is] spiritual.
071547 The first man [is] out of the earth, earthy; the second man [is] the Lord out of heaven;
071548 as [is] the earthy, such [are] also the earthy; and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] also the heavenly;
071549 and, according as we did bear the image of the earthy, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly.
071550 And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood the reign of God is not able to inherit, nor doth the corruption inherit the incorruption;
071551 lo, I tell you a secret; we indeed shall not all sleep, and we all shall be changed;
071552 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, in the last trumpet, for it shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we -- we shall be changed:
071553 for it behoveth this corruptible to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality;
071554 and when this corruptible may have put on incorruption, and this mortal may have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the word that hath been written, 'The Death was swallowed up -- to victory;
071555 where, O Death, thy sting? where, O Hades, thy victory?'
071556 and the sting of the death [is] the sin, and the power of the sin the law;
071557 and to God -- thanks, to Him who is giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ;
071558 so that, my brethren beloved, become ye stedfast, unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord at all times, knowing that your labour is not vain in the Lord.
071601 And concerning the collection that [is] for the saints, as I directed to the assemblies of Galatia, so also ye -- do ye;
071602 on every first [day] of the week, let each one of you lay by him, treasuring up whatever he may have prospered, that when I may come then collections may not be made;
071603 and whenever I may come, whomsoever ye may approve, through letters, these I will send to carry your favour to Jerusalem;
071604 and if it be meet for me also to go, with me they shall go.
071605 And I will come unto you, when I pass through Macedonia -- for Macedonia I do pass through --
071606 and with you, it may be, I will abide, or even winter, that ye may send me forward whithersoever I go,
071607 for I do not wish to see you now in the passing, but I hope to remain a certain time with you, if the Lord may permit;
071608 and I will remain in Ephesus till the Pentecost,
071609 for a door to me hath been opened -- great and effectual -- and withstanders [are] many.
071610 And if Timotheus may come, see that he may become without fear with you, for the work of the Lord he doth work, even as I,
071611 no one, then, may despise him; and send ye him forward in peace, that he may come to me, for I expect him with the brethren;
071612 and concerning Apollos our brother, much I did entreat him that he may come unto you with the brethren, and it was not at all [his] will that he may come now, and he will come when he may find convenient.
071613 Watch ye, stand in the faith; be men, be strong;
071614 let all your things be done in love.
071615 And I entreat you, brethren, ye have known the household of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruit of Achaia, and to the ministration to the saints they did set themselves --
071616 that ye also be subject to such, and to every one who is working with [us] and labouring;
071617 and I rejoice over the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because the lack of you did these fill up;
071618 for they did refresh my spirit and yours; acknowledge ye, therefore, those who [are] such.
071619 Salute you do the assemblies of Asia; salute you much in the Lord do Aquilas and Priscilla, with the assembly in their house;
071620 salute you do all the brethren; salute ye one another in an holy kiss.
071621 The salutation of [me] Paul with my hand;
071622 if any one doth not love the Lord Jesus Christ -- let him be anathema! The Lord hath come!
071623 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you;
071624 my love [is] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
080101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Timotheus the brother, to the assembly of God that is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:
080102 Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
080103 Blessed [is] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the mercies, and God of all comfort,
080104 who is comforting us in all our tribulation, for our being able to comfort those in any tribulation through the comfort with which we are comforted ourselves by God;
080105 because, as the sufferings of the Christ do abound to us, so through the Christ doth abound also our comfort;
080106 and whether we be in tribulation, [it is] for your comfort and salvation, that is wrought in the enduring of the same sufferings that we also suffer; whether we are comforted, [it is] for your comfort and salvation;
080107 and our hope [is] stedfast for you, knowing that even as ye are partakers of the sufferings -- so also of the comfort.
080108 For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation that happened to us in Asia, that we were exceedingly burdened above [our] power, so that we despaired even of life;
080109 but we ourselves in ourselves the sentence of the death have had, that we may not be trusting on ourselves, but on God, who is raising the dead,
080110 who out of so great a death did deliver us, and doth deliver, in whom we have hoped that even yet He will deliver;
080111 ye working together also for us by your supplication, that the gift through many persons to us, through many may be thankfully acknowledged for us.
080112 For our glorying is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we did conduct ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you;
080113 for no other things do we write to you, but what ye either do read or also acknowledge, and I hope that also unto the end ye shall acknowledge,
080114 according as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that your glory we are, even as also ye [are] ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus;
080115 and in this confidence I was purposing to come unto you before, that a second favour ye might have,
080116 and through you to pass to Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and by you to be sent forward to Judea.
080117 This, therefore, counselling, did I then use the lightness; or the things that I counsel, according to the flesh do I counsel, that it may be with me Yes, yes, and No, no?
080118 and God [is] faithful, that our word unto you became not Yes and No,
080119 for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, among you through us having been preached -- through me and Silvanus and Timotheus -- did not become Yes and No, but in him it hath become Yes;
080120 for as many as [are] promises of God, in him [are] the Yes, and in him the Amen, for glory to God through us;
080121 and He who is confirming you with us into Christ, and did anoint us, [is] God,
080122 who also sealed us, and gave the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
080123 And I for a witness on God do call upon my soul, that sparing you, I came not yet to Corinth;
080124 not that we are lords over your faith, but we are workers together with your joy, for by the faith ye stand.
080201 And I decided this to myself, not again to come in sorrow unto you,
080202 for if I make you sorry, then who is he who is making me glad, except he who is made sorry by me?
080203 and I wrote to you this same thing, that having come, I may not have sorrow from them of whom it behoved me to have joy, having confidence in you all, that my joy is of you all,
080204 for out of much tribulation and pressure of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that ye might be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly toward you.
080205 And if any one hath caused sorrow, he hath not caused sorrow to me, but in part, that I may not burden you all;
080206 sufficient to such a one is this punishment, that [is] by the more part,
080207 so that, on the contrary, [it is] rather for you to forgive and to comfort, lest by over abundant sorrow such a one may be swallowed up;
080208 wherefore, I call upon you to confirm love to him,
080209 for, for this also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether in regard to all things ye are obedient.
080210 And to whom ye forgive anything -- I also; for I also, if I have forgiven anything, to whom I have forgiven [it], because of you -- in the person of Christ -- [I forgive it,]
080211 that we may not be over-reached by the Adversary, for of his devices we are not ignorant.
080212 And having come to Troas for the good news of the Christ, and a door to me having been opened in the Lord,
080213 I have not had rest to my spirit, on my not finding Titus my brother, but having taken leave of them, I went forth to Macedonia;
080214 and to God [are] thanks, who at all times is leading us in triumph in the Christ, and the fragrance of His knowledge He is manifesting through us in every place,
080215 because of Christ a sweet fragrance we are to God, in those being saved, and in those being lost;
080216 to the one, indeed, a fragrance of death to death, and to the other, a fragrance of life to life; and for these things who is sufficient?
080217 for we are not as the many, adulterating the word of God, but as of sincerity -- but as of God; in the presence of God, in Christ we do speak.
080301 Do we begin again to recommend ourselves, except we need, as some, letters of recommendation unto you, or from you?
080302 our letter ye are, having been written in our hearts, known and read by all men,
080303 manifested that ye are a letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in the tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart,
080304 and such trust we have through the Christ toward God,
080305 not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as of ourselves, but our sufficiency [is] of God,
080306 who also made us sufficient [to be] ministrants of a new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit; for the letter doth kill, and the spirit doth make alive.
080307 and if the ministration of the death, in letters, engraved in stones, came in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look stedfastly to the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face -- which was being made useless,
080308 how shall the ministration of the Spirit not be more in glory?
080309 for if the ministration of the condemnation [is] glory, much more doth the ministration of the righteousness abound in glory;
080310 for also even that which hath been glorious, hath not been glorious -- in this respect, because of the superior glory;
080311 for if that which is being made useless [is] through glory, much more that which is remaining [is] in glory.
080312 Having, then, such hope, we use much freedom of speech,
080313 and [are] not as Moses, who was putting a vail upon his own face, for the sons of Israel not stedfastly to look to the end of that which is being made useless,
080314 but their minds were hardened, for unto this day the same vail at the reading of the Old Covenant doth remain unwithdrawn -- which in Christ is being made useless --
080315 but till to-day, when Moses is read, a vail upon their heart doth lie,
080316 and whenever they may turn unto the Lord, the vail is taken away.
080317 And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty;
080318 and we all, with unvailed face, the glory of the Lord beholding in a mirror, to the same image are being transformed, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
080401 Because of this, having this ministration, according as we did receive kindness, we do not faint,
080402 but did renounce for ourselves the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor deceitfully using the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves unto every conscience of men, before God;
080403 and if also our good news is vailed, in those perishing it is vailed,
080404 in whom the god of this age did blind the minds of the unbelieving, that there doth not shine forth to them the enlightening of the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God;
080405 for not ourselves do we preach, but Christ Jesus -- Lord, and ourselves your servants because of Jesus;
080406 because [it is] God who said, Out of darkness light [is] to shine, who did shine in our hearts, for the enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
080407 And we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us;
080408 on every side being in tribulation, but not straitened; perplexed, but not in despair;
080409 persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
080410 at all times the dying of the Lord Jesus bearing about in the body, that the life also of Jesus in our body may be manifested,
080411 for always are we who are living delivered up to death because of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our dying flesh,
080412 so that, the death indeed in us doth work, and the life in you.
080413 And having the same spirit of the faith, according to that which hath been written, 'I believed, therefore I did speak;' we also do believe, therefore also do we speak;
080414 knowing that He who did raise up the Lord Jesus, us also through Jesus shall raise up, and shall present with you,
080415 for the all things [are] because of you, that the grace having been multiplied, because of the thanksgiving of the more, may abound to the glory of God;
080416 wherefore, we faint not, but if also our outward man doth decay, yet the inward is renewed day by day;
080417 for the momentary light matter of our tribulation, more and more exceedingly an age-during weight of glory doth work out for us --
080418 we not looking to the things seen, but to the things not seen; for the things seen [are] temporary, but the things not seen [are] age-during.
080501 For we have known that if our earthly house of the tabernacle may be thrown down, a building from God we have, an house not made with hands -- age-during -- in the heavens,
080502 for also in this we groan, with our dwelling that is from heaven earnestly desiring to clothe ourselves,
080503 if so be that, having clothed ourselves, we shall not be found naked,
080504 for we also who are in the tabernacle do groan, being burdened, seeing we wish not to unclothe ourselves, but to clothe ourselves, that the mortal may be swallowed up of the life.
080505 And He who did work us to this self-same thing [is] God, who also did give to us the earnest of the Spirit;
080506 having courage, then, at all times, and knowing that being at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord, --
080507 for through faith we walk, not through sight --
080508 we have courage, and are well pleased rather to be away from the home of the body, and to be at home with the Lord.
080509 Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well pleasing to him,
080510 for all of us it behoveth to be manifested before the tribunal of the Christ, that each one may receive the things [done] through the body, in reference to the things that he did, whether good or evil;
080511 having known, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, and to God we are manifested, and I hope also in your consciences to have been manifested;
080512 for not again ourselves do we recommend to you, but we are giving occasion to you of glorifying in our behalf, that ye may have [something] in reference to those glorifying in face and not in heart;
080513 for whether we were beside ourselves, [it was] to God; whether we be of sound mind -- [it is] to you,
080514 for the love of the Christ doth constrain us, having judged thus: that if one for all died, then the whole died,
080515 and for all he died, that those living, no more to themselves may live, but to him who died for them, and was raised again.
080516 So that we henceforth have known no one according to the flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him no more;
080517 so that if any one [is] in Christ -- [he is] a new creature; the old things did pass away, lo, become new have the all things.
080518 And the all things [are] of God, who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and did give to us the ministration of the reconciliation,
080519 how that God was in Christ -- a world reconciling to Himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses; and having put in us the word of the reconciliation,
080520 in behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as if God were calling through us, we beseech, in behalf of Christ, 'Be ye reconciled to God;'
080521 for him who did not know sin, in our behalf He did make sin, that we may become the righteousness of God in him.
080601 And working together also we call upon [you] that ye receive not in vain the grace of God --
080602 for He saith, 'In an acceptable time I did hear thee, and in a day of salvation I did help thee, lo, now [is] a well-accepted time; lo, now, a day of salvation,' --
080603 in nothing giving any cause of offence, that the ministration may be not blamed,
080604 but in everything recommending ourselves as God's ministrants; in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses,
080605 in stripes, in imprisonments, in insurrections, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,
080606 in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
080607 in the word of truth, in the power of God, through the armour of the righteousness, on the right and on the left,
080608 through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report, as leading astray, and true;
080609 as unknown, and recognized; as dying, and lo, we live; as chastened, and not put to death;
080610 as sorrowful, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
080611 Our mouth hath been open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart hath been enlarged!
080612 ye are not straitened in us, and ye are straitened in your [own] bowels,
080613 and [as] a recompense of the same kind, (as to children I say [it],) be ye enlarged -- also ye!
080614 Become not yoked with others -- unbelievers, for what partaking [is there] to righteousness and lawlessness?
080615 and what fellowship to light with darkness? and what concord to Christ with Belial? or what part to a believer with an unbeliever?
080616 and what agreement to the sanctuary of God with idols? for ye are a sanctuary of the living God, according as God said -- 'I will dwell in them, and will walk among [them], and I will be their God, and they shall be My people,
080617 wherefore, come ye forth out of the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and an unclean thing do not touch, and I -- I will receive you,
080618 and I will be to you for a Father, and ye -- ye shall be to Me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.'
080701 Having, then, these promises, beloved, may we cleanse ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of God;
080702 receive us; no one did we wrong; no one did we waste; no one did we defraud;
080703 not to condemn you do I say [it], for I have said before that in our hearts ye are to die with and to live with;
080704 great [is] my freedom of speech unto you, great my glory on your behalf; I have been filled with the comfort, I overabound with the joy on all our tribulation,
080705 for also we, having come to Macedonia, no relaxation hath our flesh had, but on every side we are in tribulation, without [are] fightings, within -- fears;
080706 but He who is comforting the cast-down -- God -- He did comfort us in the presence of Titus;
080707 and not only in his presence, but also in the comfort with which he was comforted over you, declaring to us your longing desire, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that the more I did rejoice,
080708 because even if I made you sorry in the letter, I do not repent -- if even I did repent -- for I perceive that the letter, even if for an hour, did make you sorry.
080709 I now do rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry to reformation, for ye were made sorry toward God, that in nothing ye might receive damage from us;
080710 for the sorrow toward God reformation to salvation not to be repented of doth work, and the sorrow of the world doth work death,
080711 for, lo, this same thing -- your being made sorry toward God -- how much diligence it doth work in you! but defence, but displeasure, but fear, but longing desire, but zeal, but revenge; in every thing ye did approve yourselves to be pure in the matter.
080712 If, then, I also wrote to you -- not for his cause who did wrong, nor for his cause who did suffer wrong, but for our diligence in your behalf being manifested unto you before God --
080713 because of this we have been comforted in your comfort, and more abundantly the more did we rejoice in the joy of Titus, that his spirit hath been refreshed from you all;
080714 because if anything to him in your behalf I have boasted, I was not put to shame; but as all things in truth we did speak to you, so also our boasting before Titus became truth,
080715 and his tender affection is more abundantly toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye did receive him;
080716 I rejoice, therefore, that in everything I have courage in you.
080801 And we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God, that hath been given in the assemblies of Macedonia,
080802 because in much trial of tribulation the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, did abound to the riches of their liberality;
080803 because, according to [their] power, I testify, and above [their] power, they were willing of themselves,
080804 with much entreaty calling on us to receive the favour and the fellowship of the ministration to the saints,
080805 and not according as we expected, but themselves they did give first to the Lord, and to us, through the will of God,
080806 so that we exhorted Titus, that, according as he did begin before, so also he may finish to you also this favour,
080807 but even as in every thing ye do abound, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, that also in this grace ye may abound;
080808 not according to command do I speak, but because of the diligence of others, and of your love proving the genuineness,
080809 for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that because of you he became poor -- being rich, that ye by that poverty may become rich.
080810 and an opinion in this do I give: for this to you [is] expedient, who not only to do, but also to will, did begin before -- a year ago,
080811 and now also finish doing [it], that even as [there is] the readiness of the will, so also the finishing, out of that which ye have,
080812 for if the willing mind is present, according to that which any one may have it is well-accepted, not according to that which he hath not;
080813 for not that for others release, and ye pressured, [do I speak,]
080814 but by equality, at the present time your abundance -- for their want, that also their abundance may be for your want, that there may be equality,
080815 according as it hath been written, 'He who [did gather] much, had nothing over; and he who [did gather] little, had no lack.'
080816 And thanks to God, who is putting the same diligence for you in the heart of Titus,
080817 because indeed the exhortation he accepted, and being more diligent, of his own accord he went forth unto you,
080818 and we sent with him the brother, whose praise in the good news [is] through all the assemblies,
080819 and not only so, but who was also appointed by vote by the assemblies, our fellow-traveller, with this favour that is ministered by us, unto the glory of the same Lord, and your willing mind;
080820 avoiding this, lest any one may blame us in this abundance that is ministered by us,
080821 providing right things, not only before the Lord, but also before men;
080822 and we sent with them our brother, whom we proved in many things many times being diligent, and now much more diligent, by the great confidence that is toward you,
080823 whether -- about Titus -- my partner and towards you fellow-worker, whether -- our brethren, apostles of assemblies -- glory of Christ;
080824 the shewing therefore of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf, to them shew ye, even in the face of the assemblies.
080901 For, indeed, concerning the ministration that [is] for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you,
080902 for I have known your readiness of mind, which in your behalf I boast of to Macedonians, that Achaia hath been prepared a year ago, and the zeal of you did stir up the more part,
080903 and I sent the brethren, that our boasting on your behalf may not be made vain in this respect; that, according as I said, ye may be ready,
080904 lest if Macedonians may come with me, and find you unprepared, we -- we may be put to shame (that we say not -- ye) in this same confidence of boasting.
080905 Necessary, therefore, I thought [it] to exhort the brethren, that they may go before to you, and may make up before your formerly announced blessing, that this be ready, as a blessing, and not as covetousness.
080906 And this: He who is sowing sparingly, sparingly also shall reap; and he who is sowing in blessings, in blessings also shall reap;
080907 each one, according as he doth purpose in heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for a cheerful giver doth God love,
080908 and God [is] able all grace to cause to abound to you, that in every thing always all sufficiency having, ye may abound to every good work,
080909 (according as it hath been written, 'He dispersed abroad, he gave to the poor, his righteousness doth remain to the age,')
080910 and may He who is supplying seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,
080911 in every thing being enriched to all liberality, which doth work through us thanksgiving to God,
080912 because the ministration of this service not only is supplying the wants of the saints, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God,
080913 through the proof of this ministration glorifying God for the subjection of your confession to the good news of the Christ, and [for] the liberality of the fellowship to them and to all,
080914 and by their supplication in your behalf, longing after you because of the exceeding grace of God upon you;
080915 thanks also to God for His unspeakable gift!
081001 And I, Paul, myself, do call upon you -- through the meekness and gentleness of the Christ -- who in presence, indeed [am] humble among you, and being absent, have courage toward you,
081002 and I beseech [you], that, being present, I may not have courage, with the confidence with which I reckon to be bold against certain reckoning us as walking according to the flesh;
081003 for walking in the flesh, not according to the flesh do we war,
081004 for the weapons of our warfare [are] not fleshly, but powerful to God for bringing down of strongholds,
081005 reasonings bringing down, and every high thing lifted up against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of the Christ,
081006 and being in readiness to avenge every disobedience, whenever your obedience may be fulfilled.
081007 The things in presence do ye see? if any one hath trusted in himself to be Christ's, this let him reckon again from himself, that according as he is Christ's, so also we [are] Christ's;
081008 for even if also anything more abundantly I shall boast concerning our authority, that the Lord gave us for building up, and not for casting you down, I shall not be ashamed;
081009 that I may not seem as if I would terrify you through the letters,
081010 'because the letters indeed -- saith one -- [are] weighty and strong, and the bodily presence weak, and the speech despicable.'
081011 This one -- let him reckon thus: that such as we are in word, through letters, being absent, such also, being present, [we are] in deed.
081012 For we do not make bold to rank or to compare ourselves with certain of those commending themselves, but they, among themselves measuring themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise,
081013 and we in regard to the unmeasured things will not boast ourselves, but after the measure of the line that the God of measure did appoint to us -- to reach even unto you;
081014 for not as not reaching to you do we stretch ourselves overmuch, for even unto you did we come in the good news of the Christ,
081015 not boasting of the things not measured, in other men's labours, and having hope -- your faith increasing -- in you to be enlarged, according to our line -- into abundance,
081016 in the [places] beyond you to proclaim good news, not in another's line in regard to the things made ready, to boast;
081017 and he who is boasting -- in the Lord let him boast;
081018 for not he who is commending himself is approved, but he whom the Lord doth commend.
081101 O that ye were bearing with me a little of the folly, but ye also do bear with me:
081102 for I am zealous for you with zeal of God, for I did betroth you to one husband, a pure virgin, to present to Christ,
081103 and I fear, lest, as the serpent did beguile Eve in his subtilty, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that [is] in the Christ;
081104 for if, indeed, he who is coming doth preach another Jesus whom we did not preach, or another Spirit ye receive which ye did not receive, or other good news which ye did not accept -- well were ye bearing [it],
081105 for I reckon that I have been nothing behind the very chiefest apostles,
081106 and even if unlearned in word -- yet not in knowledge, but in every thing we were made manifest in all things to you.
081107 The sin did I do -- myself humbling that ye might be exalted, because freely the good news of God I did proclaim to you?
081108 other assemblies I did rob, having taken wages, for your ministration;
081109 and being present with you, and having been in want, I was chargeable to no one, for my lack did the brethren supply -- having come from Macedonia -- and in everything burdenless to you I did keep myself, and will keep.
081110 The truth of Christ is in me, because this boasting shall not be stopped in regard to me in the regions of Achaia;
081111 wherefore? because I do not love you? God hath known!
081112 and what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the occasion of those wishing an occasion, that in that which they boast they may be found according as we also;
081113 for those such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ,
081114 and no wonder -- for even the Adversary doth transform himself into a messenger of light;
081115 no great thing, then, if also his ministrants do transform themselves as ministrants of righteousness -- whose end shall be according to their works.
081116 Again I say, may no one think me to be a fool; and if otherwise, even as a fool receive me, that I also a little may boast.
081117 That which I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this the confidence of boasting;
081118 since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast:
081119 for gladly do ye bear with the fools -- being wise,
081120 for ye bear, if any one is bringing you under bondage, if any one doth devour, if any one doth take away, if any one doth exalt himself, if any one on the face doth smite you;
081121 in reference to dishonour I speak, how that we were weak, and in whatever any one is bold -- in foolishness I say [it] -- I also am bold.
081122 Hebrews are they? I also! Israelites are they? I also! seed of Abraham are they? I also!
081123 ministrants of Christ are they? -- as beside myself I speak -- I more; in labours more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths many times;
081124 from Jews five times forty [stripes] save one I did receive;
081125 thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice was I shipwrecked, a night and a day in the deep I have passed;
081126 journeyings many times, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from kindred, perils from nations, perils in city, perils in wilderness, perils in sea, perils among false brethren;
081127 in laboriousness and painfulness, in watchings many times, in hunger and thirst, in fastings many times, in cold and nakedness;
081128 apart from the things without -- the crowding upon me that is daily -- the care of all the assemblies.
081129 Who is infirm, and I am not infirm? who is stumbled, and I am not fired;
081130 if to boast it behoveth [me], of the things of my infirmity I will boast;
081131 the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ -- who is blessed to the ages -- hath known that I do not lie! --
081132 In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king was watching the city of the Damascenes, wishing to seize me,
081133 and through a window in a rope basket I was let down, through the wall, and fled out of his hands.
081201 To boast, really, is not profitable for me, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
081202 I have known a man in Christ, fourteen years ago -- whether in the body I have not known, whether out of the body I have not known, God hath known -- such an one being caught away unto the third heaven;
081203 and I have known such a man -- whether in the body, whether out of the body, I have not known, God hath known, --
081204 that he was caught away to the paradise, and heard unutterable sayings, that it is not possible for man to speak.
081205 Of such an one I will boast, and of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities,
081206 for if I may wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for truth I will say; but I forebear, lest any one in regard to me may think anything above what he doth see me, or doth hear anything of me;
081207 and that by the exceeding greatness of the revelations I might not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of the Adversary, that he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted overmuch.
081208 Concerning this thing thrice the Lord did I call upon, that it might depart from me,
081209 and He said to me, 'Sufficient for thee is My grace, for My power in infirmity is perfected;' most gladly, therefore, will I rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Christ may rest on me:
081210 wherefore I am well pleased in infirmities, in damages, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses -- for Christ; for whenever I am infirm, then I am powerful;
081211 I have become a fool -- boasting; ye -- ye did compel me; for I ought by you to have been commended, for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles -- even if I am nothing.
081212 The signs, indeed, of the apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds,
081213 for what is there in which ye were inferior to the rest of the assemblies, except that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this injustice!
081214 Lo, a third time I am ready to come unto you, and I will not be a burden to you, for I seek not yours, but you, for the children ought not for the parents to lay up, but the parents for the children,
081215 and I most gladly will spend and be entirely spent for your souls, even if, more abundantly loving you, less I am loved.
081216 And be it [so], I -- I did not burden you, but being crafty, with guile I did take you;
081217 any one of those whom I have sent unto you -- by him did I take advantage of you?
081218 I entreated Titus, and did send with [him] the brother; did Titus take advantage of you? in the same spirit did we not walk? -- did we not in the same steps?
081219 Again, think ye that to you we are making defence? before God in Christ do we speak; and the all things, beloved, [are] for your up-building,
081220 for I fear lest, having come, not such as I wish I may find you, and I -- I may be found by you such as ye do not wish, lest there be strifes, envyings, wraths, revelries, evil-speakings, whisperings, puffings up, insurrections,
081221 lest again having come, my God may humble me in regard to you, and I may bewail many of those having sinned before, and not having reformed concerning the uncleanness, and whoredom, and lasciviousness, that they did practise.
081301 This third time do I come unto you; on the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every saying be established;
081302 I have said before, and I say [it] before, as being present, the second time, and being absent, now, do I write to those having sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare,
081303 since a proof ye seek of the Christ speaking in me, who to you is not infirm, but is powerful in you,
081304 for even if he was crucified from infirmity, yet he doth live from the power of God; for we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him from the power of God toward you.
081305 Your ownselves try ye, if ye are in the faith; your ownselves prove ye; do ye not know your ownselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, if ye be not in some respect disapproved of?
081306 and I hope that ye shall know that we -- we are not disapproved of;
081307 and I pray before God that ye do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is right, and we may be as disapproved;
081308 for we are not able to do anything against the truth, but for the truth;
081309 for we rejoice when we may be infirm, and ye may be powerful; and this also we pray for -- your perfection!
081310 because of this, these things -- being absent -- I write, that being present, I may not treat [any] sharply, according to the authority that the Lord did give me for building up, and not for casting down.
081311 Henceforth, brethren, rejoice; be made perfect, be comforted, be of the same mind, be at peace, and the God of the love and peace shall be with you;
081312 salute one another in an holy kiss;
081313 salute you do all the saints;
081314 the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, [is] with you all! Amen.
090101 Paul, an apostle -- not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who did raise him out of the dead --
090102 and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:
090103 Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
090104 who did give himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil age, according to the will of God even our Father,
090105 to whom [is] the glory to the ages of the ages. Amen.
090106 I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news;
090107 that is not another, except there be certain who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the Christ;
090108 but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you -- anathema let him be!
090109 as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you may proclaim good news different from what ye did receive -- anathema let him be!
090110 for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if yet men I did please -- Christ's servant I should not be.
090111 And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man,
090112 for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught [it], but through a revelation of Jesus Christ,
090113 for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting it,
090114 and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers' deliverances,
090115 and when God was well pleased -- having separated me from the womb of my mother, and having called [me] through His grace --
090116 to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,
090117 nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus,
090118 then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days,
090119 and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the brother of the Lord.
090120 And the things that I write to you, lo, before God -- I lie not;
090121 then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,
090122 and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that [are] in Christ,
090123 and only they were hearing, that 'he who is persecuting us then, doth now proclaim good news -- the faith that then he was wasting;'
090124 and they were glorifying God in me.
090201 Then, after fourteen years again I went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken with me also Titus;
090202 and I went up by revelation, and did submit to them the good news that I preach among the nations, and privately to those esteemed, lest in vain I might run or did run;
090203 but not even Titus, who [is] with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised --
090204 and [that] because of the false brethren brought in unawares, who did come in privily to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus, that us they might bring under bondage,
090205 to whom not even for an hour we gave place by subjection, that the truth of the good news might remain to you.
090206 And from those who were esteemed to be something -- whatever they were then, it maketh no difference to me -- the face of man God accepteth not, for -- to me those esteemed did add nothing,
090207 but, on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of the uncircumcision, as Peter with [that] of the circumcision,
090208 for He who did work with Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, did work also in me in regard to the nations,
090209 and having known the grace that was given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, who were esteemed to be pillars, a right hand of fellowship they did give to me, and to Barnabas, that we to the nations, and they to the circumcision [may go],
090210 only, of the poor that we should be mindful, which also I was diligent -- this very thing -- to do.
090211 And when Peter came to Antioch, to the face I stood up against him, because he was blameworthy,
090212 for before the coming of certain from James, with the nations he was eating, and when they came, he was withdrawing and separating himself, fearing those of the circumcision,
090213 and dissemble with him also did the other Jews, so that also Barnabas was carried away by their dissimulation.
090214 But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, 'If thou, being a Jew, in the manner of the nations dost live, and not in the manner of the Jews, how the nations dost thou compel to Judaize?
090215 we by nature Jews, and not sinners of the nations,
090216 having known also that a man is not declared righteous by works of law, if not through the faith of Jesus Christ, also we in Christ Jesus did believe, that we might be declared righteous by the faith of Christ, and not by works of law, wherefore declared righteous by works of law shall be no flesh.'
090217 And if, seeking to be declared righteous in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, [is] then Christ a ministrant of sin? let it not be!
090218 for if the things I threw down, these again I build up, a transgressor I set myself forth;
090219 for I through law, did die, that to God I may live;
090220 with Christ I have been crucified, and live no more do I, and Christ doth live in me; and that which I now live in the flesh -- in the faith I live of the Son of God, who did love me and did give himself for me;
090221 I do not make void the grace of God, for if righteousness [be] through law -- then Christ died in vain.
090301 O thoughtless Galatians, who did bewitch you, not to obey the truth -- before whose eyes Jesus Christ was described before among you crucified?
090302 this only do I wish to learn from you -- by works of law the Spirit did ye receive, or by the hearing of faith?
090303 so thoughtless are ye! having begun in the Spirit, now in the flesh do ye end?
090304 so many things did ye suffer in vain! if, indeed, even in vain.
090305 He, therefore, who is supplying to you the Spirit, and working mighty acts among you -- by works of law or by the hearing of faith [is it]?
090306 according as Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;
090307 know ye, then, that those of faith -- these are sons of Abraham,
090308 and the Writing having foreseen that by faith God doth declare righteous the nations did proclaim before the good news to Abraham --
090309 'Blessed in thee shall be all the nations;' so that those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham,
090310 for as many as are of works of law are under a curse, for it hath been written, 'Cursed [is] every one who is not remaining in all things that have been written in the Book of the Law -- to do them,'
090311 and that in law no one is declared righteous with God, is evident, because 'The righteous by faith shall live;'
090312 and the law is not by faith, but -- 'The man who did them shall live in them.'
090313 Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law, having become for us a curse, for it hath been written, 'Cursed is every one who is hanging on a tree,'
090314 that to the nations the blessing of Abraham may come in Christ Jesus, that the promise of the Spirit we may receive through the faith.
090315 Brethren, as a man I say [it], even of man a confirmed covenant no one doth make void or doth add to,
090316 and to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed; He doth not say, 'And to seeds,' as of many, but as of one, 'And to thy seed,' which is Christ;
090317 and this I say, A covenant confirmed before by God to Christ, the law, that came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not set aside, to make void the promise,
090318 for if by law [be] the inheritance, [it is] no more by promise, but to Abraham through promise did God grant [it].
090319 Why, then, the law? on account of the transgressions it was added, till the seed might come to which the promise hath been made, having been set in order through messengers in the hand of a mediator --
090320 and the mediator is not of one, and God is one --
090321 the law, then, [is] against the promises of God? -- let it not be! for if a law was given that was able to make alive, truly by law there would have been the righteousness,
090322 but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those believing.
090323 And before the coming of the faith, under law we were being kept, shut up to the faith about to be revealed,
090324 so that the law became our child-conductor -- to Christ, that by faith we may be declared righteous,
090325 and the faith having come, no more under a child-conductor are we,
090326 for ye are all sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus,
090327 for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ;
090328 there is not here Jew or Greek, there is not here servant nor freeman, there is not here male and female, for all ye are one in Christ Jesus;
090329 and if ye [are] of Christ then of Abraham ye are seed, and according to promise -- heirs.
090401 And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differeth nothing from a servant -- being lord of all,
090402 but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father,
090403 so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the world were in servitude,
090404 and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law,
090405 that those under law he may redeem, that the adoption of sons we may receive;
090406 and because ye are sons, God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father!'
090407 so that thou art no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.
090408 But then, indeed, not having known God, ye were in servitude to those not by nature gods,
090409 and now, having known God -- and rather being known by God -- how turn ye again unto the weak and poor elements to which anew ye desire to be in servitude?
090410 days ye observe, and months, and times, and years!
090411 I am afraid of you, lest in vain I did labour toward you.
090412 Become as I [am] -- because I also [am] as ye brethren, I beseech you; to me ye did no hurt,
090413 and ye have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did proclaim good news to you at the first,
090414 and my trial that [is] in my flesh ye did not despise nor reject, but as a messenger of God ye did receive me -- as Christ Jesus;
090415 what then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that if possible, your eyes having plucked out, ye would have given to me;
090416 so that your enemy have I become, being true to you?
090417 they are zealous for you -- [yet] not well, but they wish to shut us out, that for them ye may be zealous;
090418 and [it is] good to be zealously regarded, in what is good, at all times, and not only in my being present with you;
090419 my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till Christ may be formed in you,
090420 and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change my voice, because I am in doubt about you.
090421 Tell me, ye who are willing to be under law, the law do ye not hear?
090422 for it hath been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman,
090423 but he who [is] of the maid-servant, according to flesh hath been, and he who [is] of the free-woman, through the promise;
090424 which things are allegorized, for these are the two covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing forth, which is Hagar;
090425 for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and doth correspond to the Jerusalem that now [is], and is in servitude with her children,
090426 and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother of us all,
090427 for it hath been written, 'Rejoice, O barren, who art not bearing; break forth and cry, thou who art not travailing, because many [are] the children of the desolate -- more than of her having the husband.'
090428 And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise,
090429 but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit, so also now;
090430 but what saith the Writing? 'Cast forth the maid-servant and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman;'
090431 then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant's children, but the free-woman's.
090501 In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free -- stand ye, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude;
090502 lo, I Paul do say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;
090503 and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law;
090504 ye were freed from the Christ, ye who in law are declared righteous; from the grace ye fell away;
090505 for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do wait for,
090506 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.
090507 Ye were running well; who did hinder you -- not to obey the truth?
090508 the obedience [is] not of him who is calling you!
090509 a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven;
090510 I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.
090511 And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am I persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away;
090512 O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!
090513 For ye -- to freedom ye were called, brethren, only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love serve ye one another,
090514 for all the law in one word is fulfilled -- in this: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;'
090515 and if one another ye do bite and devour, see -- that ye may not by one another be consumed.
090516 And I say: In the Spirit walk ye, and the desire of the flesh ye may not complete;
090517 for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to another, that the things that ye may will -- these ye may not do;
090518 and if by the Spirit ye are led, ye are not under law.
090519 And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are: Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
090520 idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths, rivalries, dissensions, sects,
090521 envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like, of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit.
090522 And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
090523 meekness, temperance: against such there is no law;
090524 and those who are Christ's, the flesh did crucify with the affections, and the desires;
090525 if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may walk;
090526 let us not become vain-glorious -- one another provoking, one another envying!
090601 Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, ye who [are] spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself -- lest thou also may be tempted;
090602 of one another the burdens bear ye, and so fill up the law of the Christ,
090603 for if any one doth think [himself] to be something -- being nothing -- himself he doth deceive;
090604 and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to the other,
090605 for each one his own burden shall bear.
090606 And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing -- in all good things.
090607 Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow -- that also he shall reap,
090608 because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap life age-during;
090609 and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at the proper time we shall reap -- not desponding;
090610 therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the faith.
090611 Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand;
090612 as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised -- only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted,
090613 for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law, but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they may glory.
090614 And for me, let it not be -- to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world hath been crucified, and I to the world;
090615 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;
090616 and as many as by this rule do walk -- peace upon them, and kindness, and on the Israel of God!
090617 Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body do bear.
090618 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit, brethren! Amen.
100101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
100102 Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
100103 Blessed [is] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who did bless us in every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,
100104 according as He did choose us in him before the foundation of the world, for our being holy and unblemished before Him, in love,
100105 having foreordained us to the adoption of sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
100106 to the praise of the glory of His grace, in which He did make us accepted in the beloved,
100107 in whom we have the redemption through his blood, the remission of the trespasses, according to the riches of His grace,
100108 in which He did abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
100109 having made known to us the secret of His will, according to His good pleasure, that He purposed in Himself,
100110 in regard to the dispensation of the fulness of the times, to bring into one the whole in the Christ, both the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth -- in him;
100111 in whom also we did obtain an inheritance, being foreordained according to the purpose of Him who the all things is working according to the counsel of His will,
100112 for our being to the praise of His glory, [even] those who did first hope in the Christ,
100113 in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth -- the good news of your salvation -- in whom also having believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise,
100114 which is an earnest of our inheritance, to the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory.
100115 Because of this I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and the love to all the saints,
100116 do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
100117 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the recognition of him,
100118 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, for your knowing what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
100119 and what the exceeding greatness of His power to us who are believing, according to the working of the power of His might,
100120 which He wrought in the Christ, having raised him out of the dead, and did set [him] at His right hand in the heavenly [places],
100121 far above all principality, and authority, and might, and lordship, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in the coming one;
100122 and all things He did put under his feet, and did give him -- head over all things to the assembly,
100123 which is his body, the fulness of Him who is filling the all in all,
100201 Also you -- being dead in the trespasses and the sins,
100202 in which once ye did walk according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience,
100203 among whom also we all did walk once in the desires of our flesh, doing the wishes of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath -- as also the others,
100204 and God, being rich in kindness, because of His great love with which He loved us,
100205 even being dead in the trespasses, did make us to live together with the Christ, (by grace ye are having been saved,)
100206 and did raise [us] up together, and did seat [us] together in the heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus,
100207 that He might show, in the ages that are coming, the exceeding riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus,
100208 for by grace ye are having been saved, through faith, and this not of you -- of God the gift,
100209 not of works, that no one may boast;
100210 for of Him we are workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God did before prepare, that in them we may walk.
100211 Wherefore, remember, that ye [were] once the nations in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that called Circumcision in the flesh made by hands,
100212 that ye were at that time apart from Christ, having been alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope, and without God, in the world;
100213 and now, in Christ Jesus, ye being once afar off became nigh in the blood of the Christ,
100214 for he is our peace, who did make both one, and the middle wall of the enclosure did break down,
100215 the enmity in his flesh, the law of the commands in ordinances having done away, that the two he might create in himself into one new man, making peace,
100216 and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity in it,
100217 and having come, he did proclaim good news -- peace to you -- the far-off and the nigh,
100218 because through him we have the access -- we both -- in one Spirit unto the Father.
100219 Then, therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God,
100220 being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being chief corner-[stone],
100221 in whom all the building fitly framed together doth increase to an holy sanctuary in the Lord,
100222 in whom also ye are builded together, for a habitation of God in the Spirit.
100301 For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you the nations,
100302 if, indeed, ye did hear of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given to me in regard to you,
100303 that by revelation He made known to me the secret, according as I wrote before in few [words] --
100304 in regard to which ye are able, reading [it], to understand my knowledge in the secret of the Christ,
100305 which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit --
100306 that the nations be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in the Christ, through the good news,
100307 of which I became a ministrant, according to the gift of the grace of God that was given to me, according to the working of His power;
100308 to me -- the less than the least of all the saints -- was given this grace, among the nations to proclaim good news -- the untraceable riches of the Christ,
100309 and to cause all to see what [is] the fellowship of the secret that hath been hid from the ages in God, who the all things did create by Jesus Christ,
100310 that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly [places], through the assembly, the manifold wisdom of God,
100311 according to a purpose of the ages, which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,
100312 in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him,
100313 wherefore, I ask [you] not to faint in my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
100314 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
100315 of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named,
100316 that He may give to you, according to the riches of His glory, with might to be strengthened through His Spirit, in regard to the inner man,
100317 that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts, in love having been rooted and founded,
100318 that ye may be in strength to comprehend, with all the saints, what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,
100319 to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding the knowledge, that ye may be filled -- to all the fulness of God;
100320 and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly what we ask or think, according to the power that is working in us,
100321 to Him [is] the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the age of the ages. Amen.
100401 Call upon you, then, do I -- the prisoner of the Lord -- to walk worthily of the calling with which ye were called,
100402 with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love,
100403 being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of the peace;
100404 one body and one Spirit, according as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;
100405 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
100406 one God and Father of all, who [is] over all, and through all, and in you all,
100407 and to each one of you was given the grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ,
100408 wherefore, he saith, 'Having gone up on high he led captive captivity, and gave gifts to men,' --
100409 and that, he went up, what is it except that he also went down first to the lower parts of the earth?
100410 he who went down is the same also who went up far above all the heavens, that He may fill all things --
100411 and He gave some [as] apostles, and some [as] prophets, and some [as] proclaimers of good news, and some [as] shepherds and teachers,
100412 unto the perfecting of the saints, for a work of ministration, for a building up of the body of the Christ,
100413 till we may all come to the unity of the faith and of the recognition of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to a measure of stature of the fulness of the Christ,
100414 that we may no more be babes, tossed and borne about by every wind of the teaching, in the sleight of men, in craftiness, unto the artifice of leading astray,
100415 and, being true in love, we may increase to Him [in] all things, who is the head -- the Christ;
100416 from whom the whole body, being fitly joined together and united, through the supply of every joint, according to the working in the measure of each single part, the increase of the body doth make for the building up of itself in love.
100417 This, then, I say, and I testify in the Lord; ye are no more to walk, as also the other nations walk, in the vanity of their mind,
100418 being darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,
100419 who, having ceased to feel, themselves did give up to the lasciviousness, for the working of all uncleanness in greediness;
100420 and ye did not so learn the Christ,
100421 if so be ye did hear him, and in him were taught, as truth is in Jesus;
100422 ye are to put off concerning the former behaviour the old man, that is corrupt according to the desires of the deceit,
100423 and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
100424 and to put on the new man, which, according to God, was created in righteousness and kindness of the truth.
100425 Wherefore, putting away the lying, speak truth each with his neighbour, because we are members one of another;
100426 be angry and do not sin; let not the sun go down upon your wrath,
100427 neither give place to the devil;
100428 whoso is stealing let him no more steal, but rather let him labour, working the thing that is good with the hands, that he may have to impart to him having need.
100429 Let no corrupt word out of your mouth go forth, but what is good unto the needful building up, that it may give grace to the hearers;
100430 and make not sorrowful the Holy Spirit of God, in which ye were sealed to a day of redemption.
100431 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice,
100432 and become one to another kind, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, according as also God in Christ did forgive you.
100501 Become, then, followers of God, as children beloved,
100502 and walk in love, as also the Christ did love us, and did give himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour of a sweet smell,
100503 and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;
100504 also filthiness, and foolish talking, or jesting, -- the things not fit -- but rather thanksgiving;
100505 for this ye know, that every whoremonger, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, hath no inheritance in the reign of the Christ and God.
100506 Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,
100507 become not, then, partakers with them,
100508 for ye were once darkness, and now light in the Lord; as children of light walk ye,
100509 for the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth,
100510 proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord,
100511 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness and rather even convict,
100512 for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to speak of,
100513 and all the things reproved by the light are manifested, for everything that is manifested is light;
100514 wherefore he saith, 'Arouse thyself, thou who art sleeping, and arise out of the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.'
100515 See, then, how exactly ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise,
100516 redeeming the time, because the days are evil;
100517 because of this become not fools, but -- understanding what [is] the will of the Lord,
100518 and be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in the Spirit,
100519 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,
100520 giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and Father;
100521 subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.
100522 The wives! to your own husbands subject yourselves, as to the Lord,
100523 because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ [is] head of the assembly, and he is saviour of the body,
100524 but even as the assembly is subject to Christ, so also [are] the wives to their own husbands in everything.
100525 The husbands! love your own wives, as also the Christ did love the assembly, and did give himself for it,
100526 that he might sanctify it, having cleansed [it] with the bathing of the water in the saying,
100527 that he might present it to himself the assembly in glory, not having spot or wrinkle, or any of such things, but that it may be holy and unblemished;
100528 so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies: he who is loving his own wife -- himself he doth love;
100529 for no one ever his own flesh did hate, but doth nourish and cherish it, as also the Lord -- the assembly,
100530 because members we are of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones;
100531 'for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh;'
100532 this secret is great, and I speak in regard to Christ and to the assembly;
100533 but ye also, every one in particular -- let each his own wife so love as himself, and the wife -- that she may reverence the husband.
100601 The children! obey your parents in the Lord, for this is righteous;
100602 honour thy father and mother,
100603 which is the first command with a promise, 'That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live a long time upon the land.'
100604 And the fathers! provoke not your children, but nourish them in the instruction and admonition of the Lord.
100605 The servants! obey the masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to the Christ;
100606 not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as servants of the Christ, doing the will of God out of soul,
100607 with good-will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men,
100608 having known that whatever good thing each one may do, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether servant or freeman.
100609 And the masters! the same things do ye unto them, letting threatening alone, having known that also your Master is in the heavens, and acceptance of persons is not with him.
100610 As to the rest, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might;
100611 put on the whole armour of God, for your being able to stand against the wiles of the devil,
100612 because we have not the wrestling with blood and flesh, but with the principalities, with the authorities, with the world-rulers of the darkness of this age, with the spiritual things of the evil in the heavenly places;
100613 because of this take ye up the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to resist in the day of the evil, and all things having done -- to stand.
100614 Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about in truth, and having put on the breastplate of the righteousness,
100615 and having the feet shod in the preparation of the good-news of the peace;
100616 above all, having taken up the shield of the faith, in which ye shall be able all the fiery darts of the evil one to quench,
100617 and the helmet of the salvation receive, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the saying of God,
100618 through all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the Spirit, and in regard to this same, watching in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints --
100619 and in behalf of me, that to me may be given a word in the opening of my mouth, in freedom, to make known the secret of the good news,
100620 for which I am an ambassador in a chain, that in it I may speak freely -- as it behoveth me to speak.
100621 And that ye may know -- ye also -- the things concerning me -- what I do, all things make known to you shall Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful ministrant in the Lord,
100622 whom I did send unto you for this very thing, that ye might know the things concerning us, and that he might comfort your hearts.
100623 Peace to the brethren, and love, with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
100624 The grace with all those loving our Lord Jesus Christ -- undecayingly! Amen.
110101 Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with overseers and ministrants;
110102 Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
110103 I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,
110104 always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy making the supplication,
110105 for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now,
110106 having been confident of this very thing, that He who did begin in you a good work, will perform [it] till a day of Jesus Christ,
110107 according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and [in] the defence and confirmation of the good news, all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace.
110108 For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ,
110109 and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment,
110110 for your proving the things that differ, that ye may be pure and offenceless -- to a day of Christ,
110111 being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that [is] through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
110112 And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have come,
110113 so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium, and to the other places -- all,
110114 and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly to speak the word.
110115 Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;
110116 the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,
110117 and the other out of love, having known that for defence of the good news I am set:
110118 what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed -- and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice.
110119 For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,
110120 according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,
110121 for to me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain.
110122 And if to live in the flesh [is] to me a fruit of work, then what shall I choose? I know not;
110123 for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better,
110124 and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account,
110125 and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy of the faith,
110126 that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you.
110127 Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for the faith of the good news,
110128 and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of salvation, and that from God;
110129 because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer;
110130 the same conflict having, such as ye saw in me, and now hear of in me.
110201 If, then, any exhortation [is] in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
110202 fulfil ye my joy, that ye may mind the same thing -- having the same love -- of one soul -- minding the one thing,
110203 nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind one another counting more excellent than yourselves --
110204 each not to your own look ye, but each also to the things of others.
110205 For, let this mind be in you that [is] also in Christ Jesus,
110206 who, being in the form of God, thought [it] not robbery to be equal to God,
110207 but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made,
110208 and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death -- death even of a cross,
110209 wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that [is] above every name,
110210 that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow -- of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth --
110211 and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
110212 So that, my beloved, as ye always obey, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling your own salvation work out,
110213 for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure.
110214 All things do without murmurings and reasonings,
110215 that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse, among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world,
110216 the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in vain did I labour;
110217 but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,
110218 because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me.
110219 And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you,
110220 for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care,
110221 for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the Christ Jesus,
110222 and the proof of him ye know, that as a child [serveth] a father, with me he did serve in regard to the good news;
110223 him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me -- immediately;
110224 and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come.
110225 And I thought [it] necessary Epaphroditus -- my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need -- to send unto you,
110226 seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because ye heard that he ailed,
110227 for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have.
110228 The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having seen him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful;
110229 receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold such in honour,
110230 because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me.
110301 As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord; the same things to write to you to me indeed is not tiresome, and for you [is] sure;
110302 look to the dogs, look to the evil-workers, look to the concision;
110303 for we are the circumcision, who by the Spirit are serving God, and glorying in Christ Jesus, and in flesh having no trust,
110304 though I also have [cause of] trust in flesh. If any other one doth think to have trust in flesh, I more;
110305 circumcision on the eighth day! of the race of Israel! of the tribe of Benjamin! a Hebrew of Hebrews! according to law a Pharisee!
110306 according to zeal persecuting the assembly! according to righteousness that is in law becoming blameless!
110307 But what things were to me gains, these I have counted, because of the Christ, loss;
110308 yes, indeed, and I count all things to be loss, because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, because of whom of the all things I suffered loss, and do count them to be refuse, that Christ I may gain, and be found in him,
110309 not having my righteousness, which [is] of law, but that which [is] through faith of Christ -- the righteousness that is of God by the faith,
110310 to know him, and the power of his rising again, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,
110311 if anyhow I may attain to the rising again of the dead.
110312 Not that I did already obtain, or have been already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by the Christ Jesus;
110313 brethren, I do not reckon myself to have laid hold; and one thing -- the things behind indeed forgetting, and to the things before stretching forth --
110314 to the mark I pursue for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
110315 As many, therefore, as [are] perfect -- let us think this, and if [in] anything ye think otherwise, this also shall God reveal to you,
110316 but to what we have come -- by the same rule walk, the same thing think;
110317 become followers together of me, brethren, and observe those thus walking, according as ye have us -- a pattern;
110318 for many walk of whom many times I told you -- and now also weeping tell -- the enemies of the cross of the Christ!
110319 whose end [is] destruction, whose god [is] the belly, and whose glory [is] in their shame, who the things on earth are minding.
110320 For our citizenship is in the heavens, whence also a Saviour we await -- the Lord Jesus Christ --
110321 who shall transform the body of our humiliation to its becoming conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working of his power, even to subject to himself the all things.
110401 So then, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand ye in the Lord, beloved.
110402 Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, to be of the same mind in the Lord;
110403 and I ask also thee, genuine yoke-fellow, be assisting those women who in the good news did strive along with me, with Clement also, and the others, my fellow-workers, whose names [are] in the book of life.
110404 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice;
110405 let your forbearance be known to all men; the Lord [is] near;
110406 for nothing be anxious, but in everything by prayer, and by supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God;
110407 and the peace of God, that is surpassing all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
110408 As to the rest, brethren, as many things as are true, as many as [are] grave, as many as [are] righteous, as many as [are] pure, as many as [are] lovely, as many as [are] of good report, if any worthiness, and if any praise, these things think upon;
110409 the things that also ye did learn, and receive, and hear, and saw in me, those do, and the God of the peace shall be with you.
110410 And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye flourished again in caring for me, for which also ye were caring, and lacked opportunity;
110411 not that in respect of want I say [it], for I did learn in the things in which I am -- to be content;
110412 I have known both to be abased, and I have known to abound; in everything and in all things I have been initiated, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.
110413 For all things I have strength, in Christ's strengthening me;
110414 but ye did well, having communicated with my tribulation;
110415 and ye have known, even ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia, no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and receiving except ye only;
110416 because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my need ye sent;
110417 not that I seek after the gift, but I seek after the fruit that is overflowing to your account;
110418 and I have all things, and abound; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you -- an odour of a sweet smell -- a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God:
110419 and my God shall supply all your need, according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus;
110420 and to God, even our Father, [is] the glory -- to the ages of the ages. Amen.
110421 Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus; there salute you the brethren with me;
110422 there salute you all the saints, and specially those of Caesar's house;
110423 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you all. Amen.
120101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timotheus the brother,
120102 to the saints in Colossae, and to the faithful brethren in Christ: Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
120103 We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you,
120104 having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love that [is] to all the saints,
120105 because of the hope that is laid up for you in the heavens, which ye heard of before in the word of the truth of the good news,
120106 which is present to you, as also in all the world, and is bearing fruit, as also in you, from the day in which ye heard, and knew the grace of God in truth;
120107 as ye also learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful ministrant of the Christ,
120108 who also did declare to us your love in the Spirit.
120109 Because of this, we also, from the day in which we heard, do not cease praying for you, and asking that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
120110 to your walking worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, in every good work being fruitful, and increasing to the knowledge of God,
120111 in all might being made mighty according to the power of His glory, to all endurance and long-suffering with joy.
120112 Giving thanks to the Father who did make us meet for the participation of the inheritance of the saints in the light,
120113 who did rescue us out of the authority of the darkness, and did translate [us] into the reign of the Son of His love,
120114 in whom we have the redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of the sins,
120115 who is the image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation,
120116 because in him were the all things created, those in the heavens, and those upon the earth, those visible, and those invisible, whether thrones, whether lordships, whether principalities, whether authorities; all things through him, and for him, have been created,
120117 and himself is before all, and the all things in him have consisted.
120118 And himself is the head of the body -- the assembly -- who is a beginning, a first-born out of the dead, that he might become in all [things] -- himself -- first,
120119 because in him it did please all the fulness to tabernacle,
120120 and through him to reconcile the all things to himself -- having made peace through the blood of his cross -- through him, whether the things upon the earth, whether the things in the heavens.
120121 And you -- once being alienated, and enemies in the mind, in the evil works, yet now did he reconcile,
120122 in the body of his flesh through the death, to present you holy, and unblemished, and unblameable before himself,
120123 if also ye remain in the faith, being founded and settled, and not moved away from the hope of the good news, which ye heard, which was preached in all the creation that [is] under the heaven, of which I became -- I Paul -- a ministrant.
120124 I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and do fill up the things lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the assembly,
120125 of which I -- I did become a ministrant according to the dispensation of God, that was given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God,
120126 the secret that hath been hid from the ages and from the generations, but now was manifested to his saints,
120127 to whom God did will to make known what [is] the riches of the glory of this secret among the nations -- which is Christ in you, the hope of the glory,
120128 whom we proclaim, warning every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,
120129 for which also I labour, striving according to his working that is working in me in power.
120201 For I wish you to know how great a conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,
120202 that their hearts may be comforted, being united in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding, to the full knowledge of the secret of the God and Father, and of the Christ,
120203 in whom are all the treasures of the wisdom and the knowledge hid,
120204 and this I say, that no one may beguile you in enticing words,
120205 for if even in the flesh I am absent -- yet in the spirit I am with you, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in regard to Christ;
120206 as, then, ye did receive Christ Jesus the Lord, in him walk ye,
120207 being rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the faith, as ye were taught -- abounding in it in thanksgiving.
120208 See that no one shall be carrying you away as spoil through the philosophy and vain deceit, according to the deliverance of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ,
120209 because in him doth tabernacle all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,
120210 and ye are in him made full, who is the head of all principality and authority,
120211 in whom also ye were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of the Christ,
120212 being buried with him in the baptism, in which also ye rose with [him] through the faith of the working of God, who did raise him out of the dead.
120213 And you -- being dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh -- He made alive together with him, having forgiven you all the trespasses,
120214 having blotted out the handwriting in the ordinances that is against us, that was contrary to us, and he hath taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross;
120215 having stripped the principalities and the authorities, he made a shew of them openly -- having triumphed over them in it.
120216 Let no one, then, judge you in eating or in drinking, or in respect of a feast, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths,
120217 which are a shadow of the coming things, and the body [is] of the Christ;
120218 let no one beguile you of your prize, delighting in humble-mindedness and [in] worship of the messengers, intruding into the things he hath not seen, being vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh,
120219 and not holding the head, from which all the body -- through the joints and bands gathering supply, and being knit together -- may increase with the increase of God.
120220 If, then, ye did die with the Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances?
120221 -- thou mayest not touch, nor taste, nor handle --
120222 which are all for destruction with the using, after the commands and teachings of men,
120223 which are, indeed, having a matter of wisdom in will-worship, and humble-mindedness, and neglecting of body -- not in any honour, unto a satisfying of the flesh.
120301 If, then, ye were raised with the Christ, the things above seek ye, where the Christ is, on the right hand of God seated,
120302 the things above mind ye, not the things upon the earth,
120303 for ye did die, and your life hath been hid with the Christ in God;
120304 when the Christ -- our life -- may be manifested, then also we with him shall be manifested in glory.
120305 Put to death, then, your members that [are] upon the earth -- whoredom, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and the covetousness, which is idolatry --
120306 because of which things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,
120307 in which also ye -- ye did walk once, when ye lived in them;
120308 but now put off, even ye, the whole -- anger, wrath, malice, evil-speaking, filthy talking -- out of your mouth.
120309 Lie not one to another, having put off the old man with his practices,
120310 and having put on the new, which is renewed in regard to knowledge, after the image of Him who did create him;
120311 where there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, freeman -- but the all and in all -- Christ.
120312 Put on, therefore, as choice ones of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humble-mindedness, meekness, long-suffering,
120313 forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any one with any one may have a quarrel, as also the Christ did forgive you -- so also ye;
120314 and above all these things, [have] love, which is a bond of the perfection,
120315 and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also ye were called in one body, and become thankful.
120316 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing each other, in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, in grace singing in your hearts to the Lord;
120317 and all, whatever ye may do in word or in work, [do] all things in the name of the Lord Jesus -- giving thanks to the God and Father, through him.
120318 The wives! be subject to your own husbands, as is fit in the Lord;
120319 the husbands! love your wives, and be not bitter with them;
120320 the children! obey the parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord;
120321 the fathers! vex not your children, lest they be discouraged.
120322 The servants! obey in all things those who are masters according to the flesh, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God;
120323 and all, whatever ye may do -- out of soul work -- as to the Lord, and not to men,
120324 having known that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance -- for the Lord Christ ye serve;
120325 and he who is doing unrighteously shall receive what he did unrighteously, and there is no acceptance of persons.
120401 The masters! that which is righteous and equal to the servants give ye, having known that ye also have a Master in the heavens.
120402 In the prayer continue ye, watching in it in thanksgiving;
120403 praying at the same time also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of the Christ, because of which also I have been bound,
120404 that I may manifest it, as it behoveth me to speak;
120405 in wisdom walk ye toward those without, the time forestalling;
120406 your word always in grace -- with salt being seasoned -- to know how it behoveth you to answer each one.
120407 All the things concerning me make known to you shall Tychicus -- the beloved brother, and faithful ministrant, and fellow-servant in the Lord --
120408 whom I did send unto you for this very thing, that he might know the things concerning you, and might comfort your hearts,
120409 with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother, who is of you; all things to you shall they make known that [are] here.
120410 Salute you doth Aristarchus, my fellow-captive, and Marcus, the nephew of Barnabas, (concerning whom ye did receive commands -- if he may come unto you receive him,)
120411 and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only [are] fellow-workers for the reign of God who did become a comfort to me.
120412 Salute you doth Epaphras, who [is] of you, a servant of Christ, always striving for you in the prayers, that ye may stand perfect and made full in all the will of God,
120413 for I do testify to him, that he hath much zeal for you, and those in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.
120414 Salute you doth Lukas, the beloved physician, and Demas;
120415 salute ye those in Laodicea -- brethren, and Nymphas, and the assembly in his house;
120416 and when the epistle may be read with you, cause that also in the assembly of the Laodiceans it may be read, and the [epistle] from Laodicea that ye also may read;
120417 and say to Archippus, 'See to the ministration that thou didst receive in the Lord, that thou mayest fulfil it.'
120418 The salutation by the hand of me, Paul; remember my bonds; the grace [is] with you. Amen.
130101 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
130102 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,
130103 unceasingly remembering of you the work of the faith, and the labour of the love, and the endurance of the hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father,
130104 having known, brethren beloved, by God, your election,
130105 because our good news did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as ye have known of what sort we became among you because of you,
130106 and ye -- ye did become imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Spirit,
130107 so that ye became patterns to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia,
130108 for from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God did go forth, so that we have no need to say anything,
130109 for they themselves concerning us do declare what entrance we had unto you, and how ye did turn unto God from the idols, to serve a living and true God,
130110 and to wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He did raise out of the dead -- Jesus, who is rescuing us from the anger that is coming.
130201 For yourselves have known, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it did not become vain,
130202 but having both suffered before, and having been injuriously treated (as ye have known) in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the good news of God in much conflict,
130203 for our exhortation [is] not out of deceit, nor out of uncleanness, nor in guile,
130204 but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who is proving our hearts,
130205 for at no time did we come with speech of flattery, (as ye have known,) nor in a pretext for covetousness, (God [is] witness!)
130206 nor seeking of men glory, neither from you nor from others, being able to be burdensome, as Christ's apostles.
130207 But we became gentle in your midst, as a nurse may cherish her own children,
130208 so being desirous of you, we are well-pleased to impart to you not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because beloved ye have become to us,
130209 for ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail, for, night and day working not to be a burden upon any of you, we did preach to you the good news of God;
130210 ye [are] witnesses -- God also -- how kindly and righteously, and blamelessly to you who believe we became,
130211 even as ye have known, how each one of you, as a father his own children, we are exhorting you, and comforting, and testifying,
130212 for your walking worthily of God, who is calling you to His own reign and glory.
130213 Because of this also, we -- we do give thanks to God continually, that, having received the word of hearing from us of God, ye accepted, not the word of man, but as it is truly, the word of God, who also doth work in you who believe;
130214 for ye became imitators, brethren, of the assemblies of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because such things ye suffered, even ye, from your own countrymen, as also they from the Jews,
130215 who did both put to death the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and did persecute us, and God they are not pleasing, and to all men [are] contrary,
130216 forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always, but the anger did come upon them -- to the end!
130217 And we, brethren, having been taken from you for the space of an hour -- in presence, not in heart -- did hasten the more abundantly to see your face in much desire,
130218 wherefore we wished to come unto you, (I indeed Paul,) both once and again, and the Adversary did hinder us;
130219 for what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? are not even ye before our Lord Jesus Christ in his presence?
130220 for ye are our glory and joy.
130301 Wherefore no longer forbearing, we thought good to be left in Athens alone,
130302 and did send Timotheus -- our brother, and a ministrant of God, and our fellow-workman in the good news of the Christ -- to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith,
130303 that no one be moved in these tribulations, for yourselves have known that for this we are set,
130304 for even when we were with you, we said to you beforehand, that we are about to suffer tribulation, as also it did come to pass, and ye have known [it];
130305 because of this also, I, no longer forbearing, did send to know your faith, lest he who is tempting did tempt you, and in vain might be our labour.
130306 And now Timotheus having come unto us from you, and having declared good news to us of your faith and love, and that ye have a good remembrance of us always, desiring much to see us, as we also [to see] you,
130307 because of this we were comforted, brethren, over you, in all our tribulation and necessity, through your faith,
130308 because now we live, if ye may stand fast in the Lord;
130309 for what thanks are we able to recompense to God for you, for all the joy with which we do joy because of you in the presence of our God?
130310 night and day exceedingly beseeching, that we might see your face, and perfect the things lacking in your faith.
130311 And our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you,
130312 and you the Lord cause to increase and to abound in the love to one another, and to all, even as we also to you,
130313 to the establishing your hearts blameless in sanctification before our God and Father, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.
130401 As to the rest, then, brethren, we request you, and call upon you in the Lord Jesus, as ye did receive from us how it behoveth you to walk and to please God, that ye may abound the more,
130402 for ye have known what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus,
130403 for this is the will of God -- your sanctification; that ye abstain from the whoredom,
130404 that each of you know his own vessel to possess in sanctification and honour,
130405 not in the affection of desire, as also the nations that were not knowing God,
130406 that no one go beyond and defraud in the matter his brother, because an avenger [is] the Lord of all these, as also we spake before to you and testified,
130407 for God did not call us on uncleanness, but in sanctification;
130408 he, therefore, who is despising -- doth not despise man, but God, who also did give His Holy Spirit to us.
130409 And concerning the brotherly love, ye have no need of [my] writing to you, for ye yourselves are God-taught to love one another,
130410 for ye do it also to all the brethren who [are] in all Macedonia; and we call upon you, brethren, to abound still more,
130411 and to study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we did command you,
130412 that ye may walk becomingly unto those without, and may have lack of nothing.
130413 And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, that ye may not sorrow, as also the rest who have not hope,
130414 for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also God those asleep through Jesus he will bring with him,
130415 for this to you we say in the word of the Lord, that we who are living -- who do remain over to the presence of the Lord -- may not precede those asleep,
130416 because the Lord himself, in a shout, in the voice of a chief-messenger, and in the trump of God, shall come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first,
130417 then we who are living, who are remaining over, together with them shall be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in air, and so always with the Lord we shall be;
130418 so, then, comfort ye one another in these words.
130501 And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you,
130502 for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,
130503 for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction doth stand by them, as the travail [doth] her who is with child, and they shall not escape;
130504 and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief;
130505 all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness,
130506 so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober,
130507 for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,
130508 and we, being of the day -- let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet -- a hope of salvation,
130509 because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
130510 who did die for us, that whether we wake -- whether we sleep -- together with him we may live;
130511 wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the one, as also ye do.
130512 And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,
130513 and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;
130514 and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient unto all;
130515 see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue ye, both to one another and to all;
130516 always rejoice ye;
130517 continually pray ye;
130518 in every thing give thanks, for this [is] the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you.
130519 The Spirit quench not;
130520 prophesyings despise not;
130521 all things prove; that which is good hold fast;
130522 from all appearance of evil abstain ye;
130523 and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;
130524 stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do [it].
130525 Brethren, pray for us;
130526 salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;
130527 I charge you [by] the Lord, that the letter be read to all the holy brethren;
130528 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you! Amen.
140101 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:
140102 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
140103 We ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because increase greatly doth your faith, and abound doth the love of each one of you all, to one another;
140104 so that we ourselves do glory in you in the assemblies of God, for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye bear;
140105 a token of the righteous judgment of God, for your being counted worthy of the reign of God, for which also ye suffer,
140106 since [it is] a righteous thing with God to give back to those troubling you -- trouble,
140107 and to you who are troubled -- rest with us in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with messengers of his power,
140108 in flaming fire, giving vengeance to those not knowing God, and to those not obeying the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ;
140109 who shall suffer justice -- destruction age-during -- from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his strength,
140110 when He may come to be glorified in his saints, and to be wondered at in all those believing -- because our testimony was believed among you -- in that day;
140111 for which also we do pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and may fulfil all the good pleasure of goodness, and the work of the faith in power,
140112 that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.
140201 And we ask you, brethren, in regard to the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together unto him,
140202 that ye be not quickly shaken in mind, nor be troubled, neither through spirit, neither through word, neither through letters as through us, as that the day of Christ hath arrived;
140203 let not any one deceive you in any manner, because -- if the falling away may not come first, and the man of sin be revealed -- the son of the destruction,
140204 who is opposing and is raising himself up above all called God or worshipped, so that he in the sanctuary of God as God hath sat down, shewing himself off that he is God -- [the day doth not come].
140205 Do ye not remember that, being yet with you, these things I said to you?
140206 and now, what is keeping down ye have known, for his being revealed in his own time,
140207 for the secret of the lawlessness doth already work, only he who is keeping down now [will hinder] -- till he may be out of the way,
140208 and then shall be revealed the Lawless One, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the manifestation of his presence,
140209 [him,] whose presence is according to the working of the Adversary, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders,
140210 and in all deceitfulness of the unrighteousness in those perishing, because the love of the truth they did not receive for their being saved,
140211 and because of this shall God send to them a working of delusion, for their believing the lie,
140212 that they may be judged -- all who did not believe the truth, but were well pleased in the unrighteousness.
140213 And we -- we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved by the Lord, that God did choose you from the beginning to salvation, in sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth,
140214 to which He did call you through our good news, to the acquiring of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ;
140215 so, then, brethren, stand ye fast, and hold the deliverances that ye were taught, whether through word, whether through our letter;
140216 and may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who did love us, and did give comfort age-during, and good hope in grace,
140217 comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.
140301 As to the rest, pray ye, brethren, concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and may be glorified, as also with you,
140302 and that we may be delivered from the unreasonable and evil men, for the faith [is] not of all;
140303 and stedfast is the Lord, who shall establish you, and shall guard [you] from the evil;
140304 and we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that the things that we command you ye both do and will do;
140305 and the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to the endurance of the Christ.
140306 And we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother disorderly walking, and not after the deliverance that ye received from us,
140307 for yourselves have known how it behoveth [you] to imitate us, because we did not act disorderly among you;
140308 nor for nought did we eat bread of any one, but in labour and in travail, night and day working, not to be chargeable to any of you;
140309 not because we have not authority, but that ourselves a pattern we might give to you, to imitate us;
140310 for even when we were with you, this we did command you, that if any one is not willing to work, neither let him eat,
140311 for we hear of certain walking among you disorderly, nothing working, but over working,
140312 and such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness working, their own bread they may eat;
140313 and ye, brethren, may ye not be weary doing well,
140314 and if any one do not obey our word through the letter, this one note ye, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed,
140315 and as an enemy count [him] not, but admonish ye [him] as a brother;
140316 and may the Lord of the peace Himself give to you the peace always in every way; the Lord [is] with you all!
140317 The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is a sign in every letter; thus I write;
140318 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you all! Amen.
150101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of God our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,
150102 to Timotheus -- genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord,
150103 according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus -- I going on to Macedonia -- that thou mightest charge certain not to teach any other thing,
150104 nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in faith: --
150105 And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,
150106 from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain discourse,
150107 willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate,
150108 and we have known that the law [is] good, if any one may use it lawfully;
150109 having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides, men-slayers,
150110 whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound doctrine is adverse,
150111 according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
150112 And I give thanks to him who enabled me -- Christ Jesus our Lord -- that he did reckon me stedfast, having put [me] to the ministration,
150113 who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did [it] in unbelief,
150114 and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with faith and love that [is] in Christ Jesus:
150115 stedfast [is] the word, and of all acceptation worthy, that Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners -- first of whom I am;
150116 but because of this I found kindness, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern of those about to believe on him to life age-during:
150117 and to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God, [is] honour and glory -- to the ages of the ages! Amen.
150118 This charge I commit to thee, child Timotheus, according to the prophesies that went before upon thee, that thou mayest war in them the good warfare,
150119 having faith and a good conscience, which certain having thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck,
150120 of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I did deliver to the Adversary, that they might be instructed not to speak evil.
150201 I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:
150202 for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,
150203 for this [is] right and acceptable before God our Saviour,
150204 who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;
150205 for one [is] God, one also [is] mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,
150206 who did give himself a ransom for all -- the testimony in its own times --
150207 in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle -- truth I say in Christ, I do not lie -- a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.
150208 I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;
150209 in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,
150210 but -- which becometh women professing godly piety -- through good works.
150211 Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,
150212 and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,
150213 for Adam was first formed, then Eve,
150214 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,
150215 and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.
150301 Stedfast [is] the word: If any one the oversight doth long for, a right work he desireth;
150302 it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach,
150303 not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,
150304 his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity,
150305 (and if any one his own house [how] to lead hath not known, how an assembly of God shall he take care of?)
150306 not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil;
150307 and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil.
150308 Ministrants -- in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,
150309 having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,
150310 and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable.
150311 Women -- in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things.
150312 Ministrants -- let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses,
150313 for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that [is] in Christ Jesus.
150314 These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee soon,
150315 and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth [thee] to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God -- a pillar and foundation of the truth,
150316 and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety -- God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!
150401 And the Spirit expressly speaketh, that in latter times shall certain fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,
150402 in hypocrisy speaking lies, being seared in their own conscience,
150403 forbidding to marry -- to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth,
150404 because every creature of God [is] good, and nothing [is] to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received,
150405 for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.
150406 These things placing before the brethren, thou shalt be a good ministrant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which thou didst follow after,
150407 and the profane and old women's fables reject thou, and exercise thyself unto piety,
150408 for the bodily exercise is unto little profit, and the piety is to all things profitable, a promise having of the life that now is, and of that which is coming;
150409 stedfast [is] the word, and of all acceptation worthy;
150410 for for this we both labour and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Saviour of all men -- especially of those believing.
150411 Charge these things, and teach;
150412 let no one despise thy youth, but a pattern become thou of those believing in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity;
150413 till I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching;
150414 be not careless of the gift in thee, that was given thee through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership;
150415 of these things be careful; in these things be, that thy advancement may be manifest in all things;
150416 take heed to thyself, and to the teaching; remain in them, for this thing doing, both thyself thou shalt save, and those hearing thee.
150501 An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren;
150502 aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters -- in all purity;
150503 honour widows who are really widows;
150504 and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God.
150505 And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day,
150506 and she who is given to luxury, living -- hath died;
150507 and these things charge, that they may be blameless;
150508 and if any one for his own -- and especially for those of the household -- doth not provide, the faith he hath denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse.
150509 A widow -- let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband,
150510 in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints' feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after;
150511 and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry,
150512 having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away,
150513 and at the same time also, they learn [to be] idle, going about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking the things they ought not;
150514 I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling;
150515 for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.
150516 If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve.
150517 The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching,
150518 for the Writing saith, 'An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle,' and 'Worthy [is] the workman of his reward.'
150519 Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three witnesses.
150520 Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear;
150521 I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep, without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality.
150522 Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;
150523 no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;
150524 of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;
150525 in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid.
150601 As many as are servants under a yoke, their own masters worthy of all honour let them reckon, that the name of God and the teaching may not be evil spoken of;
150602 and those having believing masters, let them not slight [them], because they are brethren, but rather let them serve, because they are stedfast and beloved, who of the benefit are partaking. These things be teaching and exhorting;
150603 if any one be teaching otherwise, and do not consent to sound words -- those of our Lord Jesus Christ -- and to the teaching according to piety,
150604 he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and word-striving, out of which doth come envy, strife, evil-speakings, evil-surmisings,
150605 wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such;
150606 but it is great gain -- the piety with contentment;
150607 for nothing did we bring into the world -- [it is] manifest that we are able to carry nothing out;
150608 but having food and raiment -- with these we shall suffice ourselves;
150609 and those wishing to be rich, do fall into temptation and a snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men into ruin and destruction,
150610 for a root of all the evils is the love of money, which certain longing for did go astray from the faith, and themselves did pierce through with many sorrows;
150611 and thou, O man of God, these things flee, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness;
150612 be striving the good strife of the faith, be laying hold on the life age-during, to which also thou wast called, and didst profess the right profession before many witnesses.
150613 I charge thee, before God, who is making all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who did testify before Pontius Pilate the right profession,
150614 that thou keep the command unspotted, unblameable, till the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
150615 which in His own times He shall shew -- the blessed and only potentate, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords,
150616 who only is having immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no one of men did see, nor is able to see, to whom [is] honour and might age-during! Amen.
150617 Those rich in the present age charge thou not to be high-minded, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who is giving to us all things richly for enjoyment; --
150618 to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to impart, willing to communicate,
150619 treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life age-during.
150620 O Timotheus, the thing entrusted guard thou, avoiding the profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named knowledge,
150621 which certain professing -- concerning the faith did swerve; the grace [is] with you. Amen.
160101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, according to a promise of life that [is] in Christ Jesus,
160102 to Timotheus, beloved child: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord!
160103 I am thankful to God, whom I serve from progenitors in a pure conscience, that unceasingly I have remembrance concerning thee in my supplications night and day,
160104 desiring greatly to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that with joy I may be filled,
160105 taking remembrance of the unfeigned faith that is in thee, that dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that also in thee.
160106 For which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God that is in thee through the putting on of my hands,
160107 for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind;
160108 therefore thou mayest not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but do thou suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God,
160109 who did save us, and did call with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages,
160110 and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who indeed did abolish death, and did enlighten life and immortality through the good news,
160111 to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a teacher of nations,
160112 for which cause also these things I suffer, but I am not ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that he is able that which I have committed to him to guard -- to that day.
160113 The pattern hold thou of sound words, which from me thou didst hear, in faith and love that [is] in Christ Jesus;
160114 the good thing committed guard thou through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us;
160115 thou hast known this, that they did turn from me -- all those in Asia, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes;
160116 may the Lord give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus, because many times he did refresh me, and of my chain was not ashamed,
160117 but being in Rome, very diligently he sought me, and found;
160118 may the Lord give to him to find kindness from the Lord in that day; and how many things in Ephesus he did minister thou dost very well know.
160201 Thou, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that [is] in Christ Jesus,
160202 and the things that thou didst hear from me through many witnesses, these things be committing to stedfast men, who shall be sufficient also others to teach;
160203 thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ;
160204 no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please;
160205 and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully;
160206 the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to partake;
160207 be considering what things I say, for the Lord give to thee understanding in all things.
160208 Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news,
160209 in which I suffer evil -- unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God hath not been bound;
160210 because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that [is] in Christ Jesus, with glory age-during.
160211 Stedfast [is] the word: For if we died together -- we also shall live together;
160212 if we do endure together -- we shall also reign together; if we deny [him], he also shall deny us;
160213 if we are not stedfast, he remaineth stedfast; to deny himself he is not able.
160214 These things remind [them] of, testifying fully before the Lord -- not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing;
160215 be diligent to present thyself approved to God -- a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;
160216 and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance,
160217 and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,
160218 who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some;
160219 sure, nevertheless, hath the foundation of God stood, having this seal, 'The Lord hath known those who are His,' and 'Let him depart from unrighteousness -- every one who is naming the name of Christ.'
160220 And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour:
160221 if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master -- to every good work having been prepared,
160222 and the youthful lusts flee thou, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart;
160223 and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife,
160224 and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,
160225 in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,
160226 and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been caught by him at his will.
160301 And this know thou, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,
160302 for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, evil-speakers, to parents disobedient, unthankful, unkind,
160303 without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,
160304 traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,
160305 having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and from these be turning away,
160306 for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden with sins, led away with desires manifold,
160307 always learning, and never to a knowledge of truth able to come,
160308 and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also these do stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith;
160309 but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also did become.
160310 And thou -- thou hast followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,
160311 the persecutions, the afflictions, that befel me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,
160312 and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,
160313 and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.
160314 And thou -- be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with, having known from whom thou didst learn,
160315 and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known, which are able to make thee wise -- to salvation, through faith that [is] in Christ Jesus;
160316 every Writing [is] God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright, for instruction that [is] in righteousness,
160317 that the man of God may be fitted -- for every good work having been completed.
160401 I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his manifestation and his reign --
160402 preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season, convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,
160403 for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer, but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers -- itching in the hearing,
160404 and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away, and to the fables they shall be turned aside.
160405 And thou -- watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full assurance,
160406 for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release hath arrived;
160407 the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished, the faith I have kept,
160408 henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord -- the Righteous Judge -- shall give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those loving his manifestation.
160409 Be diligent to come unto me quickly,
160410 for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia,
160411 Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with thyself, for he is profitable to me for ministration;
160412 and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus;
160413 the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring thou and the books -- especially the parchments.
160414 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the Lord repay to him according to his works,
160415 of whom also do thou beware, for greatly hath he stood against our words;
160416 in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me, (may it not be reckoned to them!)
160417 and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,
160418 and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall save [me] -- to his heavenly kingdom; to whom [is] the glory to the ages of the ages! Amen.
160419 Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus' household;
160420 Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus infirm;
160421 be diligent to come before winter. Salute thee doth Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
160422 The Lord Jesus Christ [is] with thy spirit; the grace [is] with you! Amen.
170101 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that [is] according to piety,
170102 upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,
170103 (and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,
170104 to Titus -- true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!
170105 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;
170106 if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate --
170107 for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God's steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;
170108 but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,
170109 holding -- according to the teaching -- to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;
170110 for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers -- especially they of the circumcision --
170111 whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre's sake.
170112 A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said -- 'Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'
170113 this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
170114 not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;
170115 all things, indeed, [are] pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast [is] nothing pure, but of them defiled [are] even the mind and the conscience;
170116 God they profess to know, and in the works they deny [Him], being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.
170201 And thou -- be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;
170202 aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;
170203 aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,
170204 that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of [their] husbands, lovers of [their] children,
170205 sober, pure, keepers of [their own] houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.
170206 The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;
170207 concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,
170208 discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.
170209 Servants -- to their own masters [are] to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,
170210 not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.
170211 For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,
170212 teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,
170213 waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
170214 who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;
170215 these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!
170301 Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,
170302 of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome -- gentle, showing all meekness to all men,
170303 for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious -- hating one another;
170304 and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear
170305 (not by works that [are] in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,
170306 which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,
170307 that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.
170308 Stedfast [is] the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works -- who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,
170309 and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from -- for they are unprofitable and vain.
170310 A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,
170311 having known that he hath been subverted who [is] such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.
170312 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.
170313 Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,
170314 and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
170315 Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace [is] with you all!
180101 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
180102 and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house:
180103 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
180104 I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my prayers,
180105 hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
180106 that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that [is] in you toward Christ Jesus;
180107 for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
180108 Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit --
180109 because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;
180110 I entreat thee concerning my child -- whom I did beget in my bonds -- Onesimus,
180111 who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to thee,
180112 whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own bowels) receive,
180113 whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,
180114 and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,
180115 for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him,
180116 no more as a servant, but above a servant -- a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord!
180117 If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,
180118 and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to me be reckoning;
180119 I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe.
180120 Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord;
180121 having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;
180122 and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.
180123 Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)
180124 Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!
180125 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit! Amen.
190101 In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,
190102 in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;
190103 who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,
190104 having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they.
190105 For to which of the messengers said He ever, 'My Son thou art -- I to-day have begotten thee?' and again, 'I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'
190106 and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, 'And let them bow before him -- all messengers of God;'
190107 and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, 'Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'
190108 and unto the Son: 'Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the age; a scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of thy reign;
190109 thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint thee -- God, thy God -- with oil of gladness above thy partners;'
190110 and, 'Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found, and a work of thy hands are the heavens;
190111 these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,
190112 and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.'
190113 And unto which of the messengers said He ever, 'Sit at My right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?'
190114 are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?
190201 Because of this it behoveth [us] more abundantly to take heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside,
190202 for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense,
190203 how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation? which a beginning receiving -- to be spoken through the Lord -- by those having heard was confirmed to us,
190204 God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will.
190205 For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak,
190206 and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, 'What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, or a son of man, that Thou dost look after him?
190207 Thou didst make him some little less than messengers, with glory and honour Thou didst crown him, and didst set him over the works of Thy hands,
190208 all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet,' for in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things subjected to him,
190209 and him who was made some little less than messengers we see -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death, with glory and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death.
190210 For it was becoming to Him, because of whom [are] the all things, and through whom [are] the all things, many sons to glory bringing, the author of their salvation through sufferings to make perfect,
190211 for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified [are] all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
190212 saying, 'I will declare Thy name to my brethren, in the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to Thee;' and again, 'I will be trusting on Him;'
190213 and again, 'Behold I and the children that God did give to me.'
190214 Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death -- that is, the devil --
190215 and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,
190216 for, doubtless, of messengers it doth not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it layeth hold,
190217 wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people,
190218 for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
190301 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,
190302 being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,
190303 for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it,
190304 for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build [is] God,
190305 and Moses indeed [was] stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,
190306 and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast.
190307 Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, 'To-day, if His voice ye may hear --
190308 ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,
190309 in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;
190310 wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;
190311 so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- !')
190312 See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,
190313 but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,
190314 for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,
190315 in its being said, 'To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'
190316 for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;
190317 but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
190318 and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? --
190319 and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
190401 We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,
190402 for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,
190403 for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He said, 'So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,
190404 for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh [day] thus: 'And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'
190405 and in this [place] again, 'If they shall enter into My rest -- ;'
190406 since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --
190407 again He doth limit a certain day, 'To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, 'To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,'
190408 for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;
190409 there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,
190410 for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.
190411 May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,
190412 for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;
190413 and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things [are] naked and open to His eyes -- with whom is our reckoning.
190414 Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the profession,
190415 for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but [one] tempted in all things in like manner -- apart from sin;
190416 we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for seasonable help.
190501 For every chief priest -- out of men taken -- in behalf of men is set in things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,
190502 able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since himself also is compassed with infirmity;
190503 and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins;
190504 and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:
190505 so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: 'My Son thou art, I to-day have begotten thee;'
190506 as also in another [place] He saith, 'Thou [art] a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'
190507 who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong crying and tears -- having offered up, and having been heard in respect to that which he feared,
190508 through being a Son, did learn by the things which he suffered -- the obedience,
190509 and having been made perfect, he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,
190510 having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to the order of Melchisedek,
190511 concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing,
190512 for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again ye have need that one teach you what [are] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and ye have become having need of milk, and not of strong food,
190513 for every one who is partaking of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant,
190514 and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both of good and of evil.
190601 Wherefore, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith on God,
190602 of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during,
190603 and this we will do, if God may permit,
190604 for [it is] impossible for those once enlightened, having tasted also of the heavenly gift, and partakers having became of the Holy Spirit,
190605 and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the coming age,
190606 and having fallen away, again to renew [them] to reformation, having crucified again to themselves the Son of God, and exposed to public shame.
190607 For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom also it is dressed, doth partake of blessing from God,
190608 and that which is bearing thorns and briers [is] disapproved of, and nigh to cursing, whose end [is] for burning;
190609 and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus we speak,
190610 for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labour of the love, that ye shewed to His name, having ministered to the saints and ministering;
190611 and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew, unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end,
190612 that ye may not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises.
190613 For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself,
190614 saying, 'Blessing indeed I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;'
190615 and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the promise;
190616 for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all controversy to them for confirmation [is] the oath,
190617 in which God, more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose by an oath,
190618 that through two immutable things, in which [it is] impossible for God to lie, a strong comfort we may have who did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before [us],
190619 which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and entering into that within the vail,
190620 whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus, after the order of Melchisedek chief priest having become -- to the age.
190701 For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,
190702 to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, 'King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)
190703 without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.
190704 And see how great this one [is], to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,
190705 and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;
190706 and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,
190707 and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed --
190708 and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there [he], who is testified to that he was living,
190709 and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,
190710 for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.
190711 If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?
190712 for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,
190713 for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,
190714 for [it is] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
190715 And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,
190716 who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,
190717 for He doth testify -- 'Thou [art] a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'
190718 for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,
190719 (for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.
190720 And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,
190721 and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, 'The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;')
190722 by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,
190723 and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;
190724 and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,
190725 whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession for them.
190726 For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,
190727 who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;
190728 for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that [is] after the law [appointeth] the Son -- to the age having been perfected.
190801 And the sum concerning the things spoken of [is]: we have such a chief priest, who did sit down at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens,
190802 of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord did set up, and not man,
190803 for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence [it is] necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer;
190804 for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest -- (there being the priests who are offering according to the law, the gifts,
190805 who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things, as Moses hath been divinely warned, being about to construct the tabernacle, for 'See (saith He) thou mayest make all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in the mount;') --
190806 and now he hath obtained a more excellent service, how much also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better promises hath been sanctioned,
190807 for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.
190808 For finding fault, He saith to them, 'Lo, days come, saith the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant,
190809 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking [them] by their hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt -- because they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not regard them, saith the Lord, --
190810 because this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws into their mind, and upon their hearts I will write them, and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to Me for a people;
190811 and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his brother, saying, Know thou the Lord, because they shall all know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them,
190812 because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;' --
190813 in the saying 'new,' He hath made the first old, and what doth become obsolete and is old [is] nigh disappearing.
190901 It had, indeed, then (even the first tabernacle) ordinances of service, also a worldly sanctuary,
190902 for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence -- which is called 'Holy;'
190903 and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called 'Holy of holies,'
190904 having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all round about with gold, in which [is] the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of the covenant,
190905 and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat, concerning which we are not now to speak particularly.
190906 And these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in, performing the services,
190907 and into the second, once in the year, only the chief priest, not apart from blood, which he doth offer for himself and the errors of the people,
190908 the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been manifested the way of the holy [places], the first tabernacle having yet a standing;
190909 which [is] a simile in regard to the present time, in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are not able, in regard to conscience, to make perfect him who is serving,
190910 only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and fleshly ordinances -- till the time of reformation imposed upon [them].
190911 And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands -- that is, not of this creation --
190912 neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during redemption having obtained;
190913 for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an heifer, sprinkling those defiled, doth sanctify to the purifying of the flesh,
190914 how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
190915 And because of this, of a new covenant he is mediator, that, death having come, for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise of the age-during inheritance,
190916 for where a covenant [is], the death of the covenant-victim to come in is necessary,
190917 for a covenant over dead victims [is] stedfast, since it is no force at all when the covenant-victim liveth,
190918 whence not even the first apart from blood hath been initiated,
190919 for every command having been spoken, according to law, by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both the book itself and all the people did sprinkle,
190920 saying, 'This [is] the blood of the covenant that God enjoined unto you,'
190921 and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner he did sprinkle,
190922 and with blood almost all things are purified according to the law, and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness doth not come.
190923 [It is] necessary, therefore, the pattern indeed of the things in the heavens to be purified with these, and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these;
190924 for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ enter -- figures of the true -- but into the heaven itself, now to be manifested in the presence of God for us;
190925 nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief priest doth enter into the holy places every year with blood of others;
190926 since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the foundation of the world, but now once, at the full end of the ages, for putting away of sin through his sacrifice, he hath been manifested;
190927 and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this -- judgment,
190928 so also the Christ, once having been offered to bear the sins of many, a second time, apart from a sin-offering, shall appear, to those waiting for him -- to salvation!
191001 For the law having a shadow of the coming good things -- not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near,
191002 since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?
191003 but in those [sacrifices] is a remembrance of sins every year,
191004 for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
191005 Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, 'Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare for me,
191006 in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou didst not delight,
191007 then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;'
191008 saying above -- 'Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering Thou didst not will, nor delight in,' -- which according to the law are offered --
191009 then he said, 'Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;' he doth take away the first that the second he may establish;
191010 in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,
191011 and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins.
191012 And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --
191013 as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies [as] his footstool,
191014 for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified;
191015 and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after that He hath said before,
191016 'This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,'
191017 and 'their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;'
191018 and where forgiveness of these [is], there is no more offering for sin.
191019 Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,
191020 which way he did initiate for us -- new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh --
191021 and a high priest over the house of God,
191022 may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;
191023 may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful [is] He who did promise),
191024 and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,
191025 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain [is], but exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh.
191026 For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice,
191027 but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;
191028 any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,
191029 of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?
191030 for we have known Him who is saying, 'Vengeance [is] Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;' and again, 'The Lord shall judge His people;' --
191031 fearful [is] the falling into the hands of a living God.
191032 And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of sufferings,
191033 partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,
191034 for also with my bonds ye sympathised, and the robbery of your goods with joy ye did receive, knowing that ye have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one.
191035 Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward,
191036 for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having done, ye may receive the promise,
191037 for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry;
191038 and 'the righteous by faith shall live,' and 'if he may draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,'
191039 and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul.
191101 And faith is of things hoped for a confidence, of matters not seen a conviction,
191102 for in this were the elders testified of;
191103 by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come out of things appearing;
191104 by faith a better sacrifice did Abel offer to God than Cain, through which he was testified to be righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and through it, he being dead, doth yet speak.
191105 By faith Enoch was translated -- not to see death, and was not found, because God did translate him; for before his translation he had been testified to -- that he had pleased God well,
191106 and apart from faith it is impossible to please well, for it behoveth him who is coming to God to believe that He is, and to those seeking Him He becometh a rewarder.
191107 By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the things not yet seen, having feared, did prepare an ark to the salvation of his house, through which he did condemn the world, and of the righteousness according to faith he became heir.
191108 By faith Abraham, being called, did obey, to go forth to the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went forth, not knowing whither he doth go;
191109 by faith he did sojourn in the land of the promise as a strange country, in tabernacles having dwelt with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise,
191110 for he was looking for the city having the foundations, whose artificer and constructor [is] God.
191111 By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive seed, and she bare after the time of life, seeing she did judge Him faithful who did promise;
191112 wherefore, also from one were begotten -- and that of one who had become dead -- as the stars of the heaven in multitude, and as sand that [is] by the sea-shore -- the innumerable.
191113 In faith died all these, not having received the promises, but from afar having seen them, and having been persuaded, and having saluted [them], and having confessed that strangers and sojourners they are upon the earth,
191114 for those saying such things make manifest that they seek a country;
191115 and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return,
191116 but now they long for a better, that is, an heavenly, wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He did prepare for them a city.
191117 By faith Abraham hath offered up Isaac, being tried, and the only begotten he did offer up who did receive the promises,
191118 of whom it was said -- 'In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;'
191119 reckoning that even out of the dead God is able to raise up, whence also in a figure he did receive [him].
191120 By faith, concerning coming things, Isaac did bless Jacob and Esau;
191121 by faith Jacob dying -- each of the sons of Joseph did bless, and did bow down upon the top of his staff;
191122 by faith, Joseph dying, concerning the outgoing of the sons of Israel did make mention, and concerning his bones did give command.
191123 By faith Moses, having been born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child comely, and were not afraid of the decree of the king;
191124 by faith Moses, having become great, did refuse to be called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh,
191125 having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have sin's pleasure for a season,
191126 greater wealth having reckoned the reproach of the Christ than the treasures in Egypt, for he did look to the recompense of reward;
191127 by faith he left Egypt behind, not having been afraid of the wrath of the king, for, as seeing the Invisible One -- he endured;
191128 by faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that He who is destroying the first-born might not touch them.
191129 By faith they did pass through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the Egyptians having received a trial of, were swallowed up;
191130 by faith the walls of Jericho did fall, having been surrounded for seven days;
191131 by faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who disbelieved, having received the spies with peace.
191132 And what shall I yet say? for the time will fail me recounting about Gideon, Barak also, and Samson, and Jephthah, David also, and Samuel, and the prophets,
191133 who through faith did subdue kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions,
191134 quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were made powerful out of infirmities, became strong in battle, caused to give way camps of the aliens.
191135 Women received by a rising again their dead, and others were tortured, not accepting the redemption, that a better rising again they might receive,
191136 and others of mockings and scourgings did receive trial, and yet of bonds and imprisonment;
191137 they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried; in the killing of the sword they died; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins -- being destitute, afflicted, injuriously treated,
191138 of whom the world was not worthy; in deserts wandering, and [in] mountains, and [in] caves, and [in] the holes of the earth;
191139 and these all, having been testified to through the faith, did not receive the promise,
191140 God for us something better having provided, that apart from us they might not be made perfect.
191201 Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set around us, every weight having put off, and the closely besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that is set before us,
191202 looking to the author and perfecter of faith -- Jesus, who, over-against the joy set before him -- did endure a cross, shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of God did sit down;
191203 for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the sinners to himself, that ye may not be wearied in your souls -- being faint.
191204 Not yet unto blood did ye resist -- with the sin striving;
191205 and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully with you as with sons, 'My son, be not despising chastening of the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,
191206 for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten, and He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;'
191207 if chastening ye endure, as to sons God beareth Himself to you, for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten?
191208 and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have become partakers, then bastards are ye, and not sons.
191209 Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising [us], and we were reverencing [them]; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live?
191210 for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be partakers of His separation;
191211 and all chastening for the present, indeed, doth not seem to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it -- it doth yield.
191212 Wherefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees set ye up;
191213 and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed;
191214 peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from which no one shall see the Lord,
191215 looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;
191216 lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright,
191217 for ye know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he found not, though with tears having sought it.
191218 For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
191219 and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them,
191220 for they were not bearing that which is commanded, 'And if a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an arrow shot through,'
191221 and, (so terrible was the sight,) Moses said, 'I am fearful exceedingly, and trembling.'
191222 But, ye came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,
191223 to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect,
191224 and to a mediator of a new covenant -- Jesus, and to blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!
191225 See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who [speaketh] from heaven,
191226 whose voice the earth shook then, and now hath he promised, saying, 'Yet once -- I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven;'
191227 and this -- 'Yet once' -- doth make evident the removal of the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the things not shaken may remain;
191228 wherefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly, with reverence and religious fear;
191229 for also our God [is] a consuming fire.
191301 Let brotherly love remain;
191302 of the hospitality be not forgetful, for through this unawares certain did entertain messengers;
191303 be mindful of those in bonds, as having been bound with them, of those maltreated, as also yourselves being in the body;
191304 honourable [is] the marriage in all, and the bed undefiled, and whoremongers and adulterers God shall judge.
191305 Without covetousness the behaviour, being content with the things present, for He hath said, 'No, I will not leave, no, nor forsake thee,'
191306 so that we do boldly say, 'The Lord [is] to me a helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.'
191307 Be mindful of those leading you, who did speak to you the word of God, whose faith -- considering the issue of the behaviour -- be imitating,
191308 Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same, and to the ages;
191309 with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about, for [it is] good that by grace the heart be confirmed, not with meats, in which they who were occupied were not profited;
191310 we have an altar, of which to eat they have no authority who the tabernacle are serving,
191311 for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest -- of these the bodies are burned without the camp.
191312 Wherefore, also Jesus -- that he might sanctify through [his] own blood the people -- without the gate did suffer;
191313 now, then, may we go forth unto him without the camp, his reproach bearing;
191314 for we have not here an abiding city, but the coming one we seek;
191315 through him, then, we may offer up a sacrifice of praise always to God, that is, the fruit of lips, giving thanks to His name;
191316 and of doing good, and of fellowship, be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased.
191317 Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for these do watch for your souls, as about to give account, that with joy they may do this, and not sighing, for this [is] unprofitable to you.
191318 Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, in all things willing to behave well,
191319 and more abundantly do I call upon [you] to do this, that more quickly I may be restored to you.
191320 And the God of the peace, who did bring up out of the dead the great shepherd of the sheep -- in the blood of an age-during covenant -- our Lord Jesus,
191321 make you perfect in every good work to do His will, doing in you that which is well-pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom [is] the glory -- to the ages of the ages! Amen.
191322 And I entreat you, brethren, suffer the word of the exhortation, for also through few words I have written to you.
191323 Know ye that the brother Timotheus is released, with whom, if he may come more shortly, I will see you.
191324 Salute all those leading you, and all the saints; salute you doth those from Italy:
191325 the grace [is] with you all! Amen.
200101 James, of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ a servant, to the Twelve Tribes who are in the dispersion: Hail!
200102 All joy count [it], my brethren, when ye may fall into temptations manifold;
200103 knowing that the proof of your faith doth work endurance,
200104 and let the endurance have a perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire -- in nothing lacking;
200105 and if any of you do lack wisdom, let him ask from God, who is giving to all liberally, and not reproaching, and it shall be given to him;
200106 and let him ask in faith, nothing doubting, for he who is doubting hath been like a wave of the sea, driven by wind and tossed,
200107 for let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord --
200108 a two-souled man [is] unstable in all his ways.
200109 And let the brother who is low rejoice in his exaltation,
200110 and the rich in his becoming low, because as a flower of grass he shall pass away;
200111 for the sun did rise with the burning heat, and did wither the grass, and the flower of it fell, and the grace of its appearance did perish, so also the rich in his way shall fade away!
200112 Happy the man who doth endure temptation, because, becoming approved, he shall receive the crown of the life, which the Lord did promise to those loving Him.
200113 Let no one say, being tempted -- 'From God I am tempted,' for God is not tempted of evil, and Himself doth tempt no one,
200114 and each one is tempted, by his own desires being led away and enticed,
200115 afterward the desire having conceived, doth give birth to sin, and the sin having been perfected, doth bring forth death.
200116 Be not led astray, my brethren beloved;
200117 every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no variation, or shadow of turning;
200118 having counselled, He did beget us with a word of truth, for our being a certain first-fruit of His creatures.
200119 So then, my brethren beloved, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,
200120 for the wrath of a man the righteousness of God doth not work;
200121 wherefore having put aside all filthiness and superabundance of evil, in meekness be receiving the engrafted word, that is able to save your souls;
200122 and become ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves,
200123 because, if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one hath been like to a man viewing his natural face in a mirror,
200124 for he did view himself, and hath gone away, and immediately he did forget of what kind he was;
200125 and he who did look into the perfect law -- that of liberty, and did continue there, this one -- not a forgetful hearer becoming, but a doer of work -- this one shall be happy in his doing.
200126 If any one doth think to be religious among you, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, of this one vain [is] the religion;
200127 religion pure and undefiled with the God and Father is this, to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation -- unspotted to keep himself from the world.
200201 My brethren, hold not, in respect of persons, the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,
200202 for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold ring, in gay raiment, and there may come in also a poor man in vile raiment,
200203 and ye may look upon him bearing the gay raiment, and may say to him, 'Thou -- sit thou here well,' and to the poor man may say, 'Thou -- stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my footstool,' --
200204 ye did not judge fully in yourselves, and did become ill-reasoning judges.
200205 Hearken, my brethren beloved, did not God choose the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the reign that He promised to those loving Him?
200206 and ye did dishonour the poor one; do not the rich oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats;
200207 do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was called upon you?
200208 If, indeed, royal law ye complete, according to the Writing, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,' -- ye do well;
200209 and if ye accept persons, sin ye do work, being convicted by the law as transgressors;
200210 for whoever the whole law shall keep, and shall stumble in one [point], he hath become guilty of all;
200211 for He who is saying, 'Thou mayest not commit adultery,' said also, 'Thou mayest do no murder;' and if thou shalt not commit adultery, and shalt commit murder, thou hast become a transgressor of law;
200212 so speak ye and so do, as about by a law of liberty to be judged,
200213 for the judgment without kindness [is] to him not having done kindness, and exult doth kindness over judgment.
200214 What [is] the profit, my brethren, if faith, any one may speak of having, and works he may not have? is that faith able to save him?
200215 and if a brother or sister may be naked, and may be destitute of the daily food,
200216 and any one of you may say to them, 'Depart ye in peace, be warmed, and be filled,' and may not give to them the things needful for the body, what [is] the profit?
200217 so also the faith, if it may not have works, is dead by itself.
200218 But say may some one, Thou hast faith, and I have works, shew me thy faith out of thy works, and I will shew thee out of my works my faith:
200219 thou -- thou dost believe that God is one; thou dost well, and the demons believe, and they shudder!
200220 And dost thou wish to know, O vain man, that the faith apart from the works is dead?
200221 Abraham our father -- was not he declared righteous out of works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar?
200222 dost thou see that the faith was working with his works, and out of the works the faith was perfected?
200223 and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying, 'And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;' and, 'Friend of God' he was called.
200224 Ye see, then, that out of works is man declared righteous, and not out of faith only;
200225 and in like manner also Rahab the harlot -- was she not out of works declared righteous, having received the messengers, and by another way having sent forth?
200226 for as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also the faith apart from the works is dead.
200301 Many teachers become not, my brethren, having known that greater judgment we shall receive,
200302 for we all make many stumbles; if any one in word doth not stumble, this one [is] a perfect man, able to bridle also the whole body;
200303 lo, the bits we put into the mouths of the horses for their obeying us, and their whole body we turn about;
200304 lo, also the ships, being so great, and by fierce winds being driven, are led about by a very small helm, whithersoever the impulse of the helmsman doth counsel,
200305 so also the tongue is a little member, and doth boast greatly; lo, a little fire how much wood it doth kindle!
200306 and the tongue [is] a fire, the world of the unrighteousness, so the tongue is set in our members, which is spotting our whole body, and is setting on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by the gehenna.
200307 For every nature, both of beasts and of fowls, both of creeping things and things of the sea, is subdued, and hath been subdued, by the human nature,
200308 and the tongue no one of men is able to subdue, [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison,
200309 with it we do bless the God and Father, and with it we do curse the men made according to the similitude of God;
200310 out of the same mouth doth come forth blessing and cursing; it doth not need, my brethren, these things so to happen;
200311 doth the fountain out of the same opening pour forth the sweet and the bitter?
200312 is a fig-tree able, my brethren, olives to make? or a vine figs? so no fountain salt and sweet water [is able] to make.
200313 Who [is] wise and intelligent among you? let him shew out of the good behaviour his works in meekness of wisdom,
200314 and if bitter zeal ye have, and rivalry in your heart, glory not, nor lie against the truth;
200315 this wisdom is not descending from above, but earthly, physical, demon-like,
200316 for where zeal and rivalry [are], there is insurrection and every evil matter;
200317 and the wisdom from above, first, indeed, is pure, then peaceable, gentle, easily entreated, full of kindness and good fruits, uncontentious, and unhypocritical: --
200318 and the fruit of the righteousness in peace is sown to those making peace.
200401 Whence [are] wars and fightings among you? not thence -- out of your passions, that are as soldiers in your members?
200402 ye desire, and ye have not; ye murder, and are zealous, and are not able to attain; ye fight and war, and ye have not, because of your not asking;
200403 ye ask, and ye receive not, because evilly ye ask, that in your pleasures ye may spend [it].
200404 Adulterers and adulteresses! have ye not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever, then, may counsel to be a friend of the world, an enemy of God he is set.
200405 Do ye think that emptily the Writing saith, 'To envy earnestly desireth the spirit that did dwell in us,'
200406 and greater grace he doth give, wherefore he saith, 'God against proud ones doth set Himself up, and to lowly ones He doth give grace?'
200407 be subject, then, to God; stand up against the devil, and he will flee from you;
200408 draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you; cleanse hands, ye sinners! and purify hearts, ye two-souled!
200409 be exceeding afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter to mourning be turned, and the joy to heaviness;
200410 be made low before the Lord, and He shall exalt you.
200411 Speak not one against another, brethren; he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, doth speak against law, and doth judge law, and if law thou dost judge, thou art not a doer of law but a judge;
200412 one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; thou -- who art thou that dost judge the other?
200413 Go, now, ye who are saying, 'To-day and to-morrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year, and traffic, and make gain;'
200414 who do not know the thing of the morrow; for what is your life? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a little, and then is vanishing;
200415 instead of your saying, 'If the Lord may will, we shall live, and do this or that;'
200416 and now ye glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil;
200417 to him, then, knowing to do good, and not doing, sin it is to him.
200501 Go, now, ye rich! weep, howling over your miseries that are coming upon [you];
200502 your riches have rotted, and your garments have become moth-eaten;
200503 your gold and silver have rotted, and the rust of them for a testimony shall be to you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye made treasure in the last days!
200504 lo, the reward of the workmen, of those who in-gathered your fields, which hath been fraudulently kept back by you -- doth cry out, and the exclamations of those who did reap into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth have entered;
200505 ye did live in luxury upon the earth, and were wanton; ye did nourish your hearts, as in a day of slaughter;
200506 ye did condemn -- ye did murder the righteous one, he doth not resist you.
200507 Be patient, then, brethren, till the presence of the Lord; lo, the husbandman doth expect the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, till he may receive rain -- early and latter;
200508 be patient, ye also; establish your hearts, because the presence of the Lord hath drawn nigh;
200509 murmur not against one another, brethren, that ye may not be condemned; lo, the Judge before the door hath stood.
200510 An example take ye of the suffering of evil, my brethren, and of the patience, the prophets who did speak in the name of the Lord;
200511 lo, we call happy those who are enduring; the endurance of Job ye heard of, and the end of the Lord ye have seen, that very compassionate is the Lord, and pitying.
200512 And before all things, my brethren, do not swear, neither by the heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath, and let your Yes be Yes, and the No, No; that under judgment ye may not fall.
200513 Doth any one suffer evil among you? let him pray; is any of good cheer? let him sing psalms;
200514 is any infirm among you? let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil, in the name of the Lord,
200515 and the prayer of the faith shall save the distressed one, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if sins he may have committed, they shall be forgiven to him.
200516 Be confessing to one another the trespasses, and be praying for one another, that ye may be healed; very strong is a working supplication of a righteous man;
200517 Elijah was a man like affected as we, and with prayer he did pray -- not to rain, and it did not rain upon the land three years and six months;
200518 and again he did pray, and the heaven did give rain, and the land did bring forth her fruit.
200519 Brethren, if any among you may go astray from the truth, and any one may turn him back,
200520 let him know that he who did turn back a sinner from the straying of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.
210101 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the choice sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
210102 according to a foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied!
210103 Blessed [is] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to the abundance of His kindness did beget us again to a living hope, through the rising again of Jesus Christ out of the dead,
210104 to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in the heavens for you,
210105 who, in the power of God are being guarded, through faith, unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time,
210106 in which ye are glad, a little now, if it be necessary, being made to sorrow in manifold trials,
210107 that the proof of your faith -- much more precious than of gold that is perishing, and through fire being approved -- may be found to praise, and honour, and glory, in the revelation of Jesus Christ,
210108 whom, not having seen, ye love, in whom, now not seeing and believing, ye are glad with joy unspeakable and glorified,
210109 receiving the end of your faith -- salvation of souls;
210110 concerning which salvation seek out and search out did prophets who concerning the grace toward you did prophecy,
210111 searching in regard to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ that was in them was manifesting, testifying beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory after these,
210112 to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were ministering these, which now were told to you (through those who did proclaim good news to you,) in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, to which things messengers do desire to bend looking.
210113 Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope perfectly upon the grace that is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,
210114 as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance,
210115 but according as He who did call you [is] holy, ye also, become holy in all behaviour,
210116 because it hath been written, 'Become ye holy, because I am holy;'
210117 and if on the Father ye do call, who without acceptance of persons is judging according to the work of each, in fear the time of your sojourn pass ye,
210118 having known that, not with corruptible things -- silver or gold -- were ye redeemed from your foolish behaviour delivered by fathers,
210119 but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted -- Christ's --
210120 foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, and manifested in the last times because of you,
210121 who through him do believe in God, who did raise out of the dead, and glory to him did give, so that your faith and hope may be in God.
210122 Your souls having purified in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to brotherly love unfeigned, out of a pure heart one another love ye earnestly,
210123 being begotten again, not out of seed corruptible, but incorruptible, through a word of God -- living and remaining -- to the age;
210124 because all flesh [is] as grass, and all glory of man as flower of grass; wither did the grass, and the flower of it fell away,
210125 and the saying of the Lord doth remain -- to the age; and this is the saying that was proclaimed good news to you.
210201 Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings,
210202 as new-born babes the word's pure milk desire ye, that in it ye may grow,
210203 if so be ye did taste that the Lord [is] gracious,
210204 to whom coming -- a living stone -- by men, indeed, having been disapproved of, but with God choice, precious,
210205 and ye yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
210206 Wherefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: 'Lo, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is believing on him may not be put to shame;'
210207 to you, then, who are believing [is] the preciousness; and to the unbelieving, a stone that the builders disapproved of, this one did become for the head of a corner,
210208 and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence -- who are stumbling at the word, being unbelieving, -- to which also they were set;
210209 and ye [are] a choice race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired, that the excellences ye may shew forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous light;
210210 who [were] once not a people, and [are] now the people of God; who had not found kindness, and now have found kindness.
210211 Beloved, I call upon [you], as strangers and sojourners, to keep from the fleshly desires, that war against the soul,
210212 having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection.
210213 Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the Lord, whether to a king, as the highest,
210214 whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for punishment, indeed, of evil-doers, and a praise of those doing good;
210215 because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men;
210216 as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the evil, but as servants of God;
210217 to all give ye honour; the brotherhood love ye; God fear ye; the king honour ye.
210218 The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the cross;
210219 for this [is] gracious, if because of conscience toward God any one doth endure sorrows, suffering unrighteously;
210220 for what renown [is it], if sinning and being buffeted, ye do endure [it]? but if, doing good and suffering [for it], ye do endure, this [is] gracious with God,
210221 for to this ye were called, because Christ also did suffer for you, leaving to you an example, that ye may follow his steps,
210222 who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth,
210223 who being reviled -- was not reviling again, suffering -- was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is judging righteously,
210224 who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes ye were healed,
210225 for ye were as sheep going astray, but ye turned back now to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.
210301 In like manner, the wives, be ye subject to your own husbands, that even if certain are disobedient to the word, through the conversation of the wives, without the word, they may be won,
210302 having beheld your pure behaviour in fear,
210303 whose adorning -- let it not be that which is outward, of plaiting of hair, and of putting around of things of gold, or of putting on of garments,
210304 but -- the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible thing of the meek and quiet spirit, which is, before God, of great price,
210305 for thus once also the holy women who did hope on God, were adorning themselves, being subject to their own husbands,
210306 as Sarah was obedient to Abraham, calling him 'sir,' of whom ye did become daughters, doing good, and not fearing any terror.
210307 The husbands, in like manner, dwelling with [them], according to knowledge, as to a weaker vessel -- to the wife -- imparting honour, as also being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.
210308 And finally, being all of one mind, having fellow-feeling, loving as brethren, compassionate, courteous,
210309 not giving back evil for evil, or railing for railing, and on the contrary, blessing, having known that to this ye were called, that a blessing ye may inherit;
210310 for 'he who is willing to love life, and to see good days, let him guard his tongue from evil, and his lips -- not to speak guile;
210311 let him turn aside from evil, and do good, let him seek peace and pursue it;
210312 because the eyes of the Lord [are] upon the righteous, and His ears -- to their supplication, and the face of the Lord [is] upon those doing evil;'
210313 and who [is] he who will be doing you evil, if of Him who is good ye may become imitators?
210314 but if ye also should suffer because of righteousness, happy [are ye]! and of their fear be not afraid, nor be troubled,
210315 and the Lord God sanctify in your hearts. And [be] ready always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that [is] in you, with meekness and fear;
210316 having a good conscience, that in that in which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who are traducing your good behaviour in Christ;
210317 for [it is] better doing good, if the will of God will it, to suffer, than doing evil;
210318 because also Christ once for sin did suffer -- righteous for unrighteous -- that he might lead us to God, having been put to death indeed, in the flesh, and having been made alive in the spirit,
210319 in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did preach,
210320 who sometime disbelieved, when once the long-suffering of God did wait, in days of Noah -- an ark being preparing -- in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;
210321 also to which an antitype doth now save us -- baptism, (not a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a good conscience in regard to God,) through the rising again of Jesus Christ,
210322 who is at the right hand of God, having gone on to heaven -- messengers, and authorities, and powers, having been subjected to him.
210401 Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, ye also with the same mind arm yourselves, because he who did suffer in the flesh hath done with sin,
210402 no more in the desires of men, but in the will of God, to live the rest of the time in the flesh;
210403 for sufficient to us [is] the past time of life the will of the nations to have wrought, having walked in lasciviousnesses, desires, excesses of wines, revelings, drinking-bouts, and unlawful idolatries,
210404 in which they think it strange -- your not running with them to the same excess of dissoluteness, speaking evil,
210405 who shall give an account to Him who is ready to judge living and dead,
210406 for for this also to dead men was good news proclaimed, that they may be judged, indeed, according to men in the flesh, and may live according to God in the spirit.
210407 And of all things the end hath come nigh; be sober-minded, then, and watch unto the prayers,
210408 and, before all things, to one another having the earnest love, because the love shall cover a multitude of sins;
210409 hospitable to one another, without murmuring;
210410 each, according as he received a gift, to one another ministering it, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;
210411 if any one doth speak -- 'as oracles of God;' if any one doth minister -- 'as of the ability which God doth supply;' that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power -- to the ages of the ages. Amen.
210412 Beloved, think it not strange at the fiery suffering among you that is coming to try you, as if a strange thing were happening to you,
210413 but, according as ye have fellowship with the sufferings of the Christ, rejoice ye, that also in the revelation of his glory ye may rejoice -- exulting;
210414 if ye be reproached in the name of Christ -- happy [are ye], because the Spirit of glory and of God upon you doth rest; in regard, indeed, to them, he is evil-spoken of, and in regard to you, he is glorified;
210415 for let none of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evil-doer, or as an inspector into other men's matters;
210416 and if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; and let him glorify God in this respect;
210417 because it is the time of the beginning of the judgment from the house of God, and if first from us, what the end of those disobedient to the good news of God?
210418 And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, the ungodly and sinner -- where shall he appear?
210419 so that also those suffering according to the will of god, as to a stedfast Creator, let them commit their own souls in good doing.
210501 Elders who [are] among you, I exhort, who [am] a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and of the glory about to be revealed a partaker,
210502 feed the flock of God that [is] among you, overseeing not constrainedly, but willingly, neither for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind,
210503 neither as exercising lordship over the heritages, but patterns becoming of the flock,
210504 and at the manifestation of the chief Shepherd, ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory.
210505 In like manner, ye younger, be subject to elders, and all to one another subjecting yourselves; with humble-mindedness clothe yourselves, because God the proud doth resist, but to the humble He doth give grace;
210506 be humbled, then, under the powerful hand of God, that you He may exalt in good time,
210507 all your care having cast upon Him, because He careth for you.
210508 Be sober, vigilant, because your opponent the devil, as a roaring lion, doth walk about, seeking whom he may swallow up,
210509 whom resist, stedfast in the faith, having known the same sufferings to your brotherhood in the world to be accomplished.
210510 And the God of all grace, who did call you to His age-during glory in Christ Jesus, having suffered a little, Himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle [you];
210511 to Him [is] the glory, and the power -- to the ages and the ages! Amen.
210512 Through Silvanus, to you the faithful brother, as I reckon, through few [words] I did write, exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace of God in which ye have stood.
210513 Salute you doth the [assembly] in Babylon jointly elected, and Markus my son.
210514 Salute ye one another in a kiss of love; peace to you all who [are] in Christ Jesus! Amen.
220101 Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who did obtain a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:
220102 Grace to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgement of God and of Jesus our Lord!
220103 As all things to us His divine power (the things pertaining unto life and piety) hath given, through the acknowledgement of him who did call us through glory and worthiness,
220104 through which to us the most great and precious promises have been given, that through these ye may become partakers of a divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world in desires.
220105 And this same also -- all diligence having brought in besides, superadd in your faith the worthiness, and in the worthiness the knowledge,
220106 and in the knowledge the temperance, and in the temperance the endurance, and in the endurance the piety,
220107 and in the piety the brotherly kindness, and in the brotherly kindness the love;
220108 for these things being to you and abounding, do make [you] neither inert nor unfruitful in regard to the acknowledging of our Lord Jesus Christ,
220109 for he with whom these things are not present is blind, dim-sighted, having become forgetful of the cleansing of his old sins;
220110 wherefore, the rather, brethren, be diligent to make stedfast your calling and choice, for these things doing, ye may never stumble,
220111 for so, richly shall be superadded to you the entrance into the age-during reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
220112 Wherefore, I will not be careless always to remind you concerning these things, though, having known them, and having been established in the present truth,
220113 and I think right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up in reminding [you],
220114 having known that soon is the laying aside of my tabernacle, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ did shew to me,
220115 and I will be diligent that also at every time ye have, after my outgoing, power to make to yourselves the remembrance of these things.
220116 For, skilfully devised fables not having followed out, we did make known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but eye-witnesses having become of his majesty --
220117 for having received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being borne to him by the excellent glory: 'This is My Son -- the beloved, in whom I was well pleased;'
220118 and this voice we -- we did hear, out of heaven borne, being with him in the holy mount.
220119 And we have more firm the prophetic word, to which we do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till day may dawn, and a morning star may arise -- in your hearts;
220120 this first knowing, that no prophecy of the Writing doth come of private exposition,
220121 for not by will of man did ever prophecy come, but by the Holy Spirit borne on holy men of God spake.
220201 And there did come also false prophets among the people, as also among you there shall be false teachers, who shall bring in besides destructive sects, and the Master who bought them denying, bringing to themselves quick destruction,
220202 and many shall follow out their destructive ways, because of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of,
220203 and in covetousness, with moulded words, of you they shall make merchandise, whose judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction doth not slumber.
220204 For if God messengers who sinned did not spare, but with chains of thick gloom, having cast [them] down to Tartarus, did deliver [them] to judgment, having been reserved,
220205 and the old world did not spare, but the eighth person, Noah, of righteousness a preacher, did keep, a flood on the world of the impious having brought,
220206 and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah having turned to ashes, with an overthrow did condemn, an example to those about to be impious having set [them];
220207 and righteous Lot, worn down by the conduct in lasciviousness of the impious, He did rescue,
220208 for in seeing and hearing, the righteous man, dwelling among them, day by day the righteous soul with unlawful works was harassing.
220209 The Lord hath known to rescue pious ones out of temptation, and unrighteous ones to a day of judgment, being punished, to keep,
220210 and chiefly those going behind the flesh in desire of uncleanness, and lordship despising; presumptuous, self-complacent, dignities they are not afraid to speak evil of,
220211 whereas messengers, in strength and power being greater, do not bear against them before the Lord an evil speaking judgment;
220212 and these, as irrational natural beasts, made to be caught and destroyed -- in what things they are ignorant of, speaking evil -- in their destruction shall be destroyed,
220213 about to receive a reward of unrighteousness, pleasures counting the luxury in the day, spots and blemishes, luxuriating in their deceits, feasting with you,
220214 having eyes full of adultery, and unable to cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having an heart exercised in covetousnesses, children of a curse,
220215 having forsaken a right way, they did go astray, having followed in the way of Balaam the [son] of Bosor, who a reward of unrighteousness did love,
220216 and had a rebuke of his own iniquity -- a dumb ass, in man's voice having spoken, did forbid the madness of the prophet.
220217 These are wells without water, and clouds by a tempest driven, to whom the thick gloom of the darkness to the age hath been kept;
220218 for overswellings of vanity speaking, they do entice in desires of the flesh -- lasciviousnesses, those who had truly escaped from those conducting themselves in error,
220219 liberty to them promising, themselves being servants of the corruption, for by whom any one hath been overcome, to this one also he hath been brought to servitude,
220220 for, if having escaped from the pollutions of the world, in the acknowledging of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and by these again being entangled, they have been overcome, become to them hath the last things worse than the first,
220221 for it were better to them not to have acknowledged the way of the righteousness, than having acknowledged [it], to turn back from the holy command delivered to them,
220222 and happened to them hath that of the true similitude; 'A dog did turn back upon his own vomit,' and, 'A sow having bathed herself -- to rolling in mire.'
220301 This, now, beloved, a second letter to you I write, in both which I stir up your pure mind in reminding [you],
220302 to be mindful of the sayings said before by the holy prophets, and of the command of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour,
220303 this first knowing, that there shall come in the latter end of the days scoffers, according to their own desires going on,
220304 and saying, 'Where is the promise of his presence? for since the fathers did fall asleep, all things so remain from the beginning of the creation;'
220305 for this is unobserved by them willingly, that the heavens were of old, and the earth out of water and through water standing together by the word of God,
220306 through which the then world, by water having been deluged, was destroyed;
220307 and the present heavens and the earth, by the same word are treasured, for fire being kept to a day of judgment and destruction of the impious men.
220308 And this one thing let not be unobserved by you, beloved, that one day with the Lord [is] as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day;
220309 the Lord is not slow in regard to the promise, as certain count slowness, but is long-suffering to us, not counselling any to be lost but all to pass on to reformation,
220310 and it will come -- the day of the Lord -- as a thief in the night, in which the heavens with a rushing noise will pass away, and the elements with burning heat be dissolved, and earth and the works in it shall be burnt up.
220311 All these, then, being dissolved, what kind of persons doth it behove you to be in holy behaviours and pious acts?
220312 waiting for and hasting to the presence of the day of God, by which the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements with burning heat shall melt;
220313 and for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise we do wait, in which righteousness doth dwell;
220314 wherefore, beloved, these things waiting for, be diligent, spotless and unblameable, by Him to be found in peace,
220315 and the long-suffering of our Lord count ye salvation, according as also our beloved brother Paul -- according to the wisdom given to him -- did write to you,
220316 as also in all the epistles, speaking in them concerning these things, among which things are certain hard to be understood, which the untaught and unstable do wrest, as also the other Writings, unto their own destruction.
220317 Ye, then, beloved, knowing before, take heed, lest, together with the error of the impious being led away, ye may fall from your own stedfastness,
220318 and increase ye in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; to him [is] the glory both now, and to the day of the age! Amen.
230101 That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we did behold, and our hands did handle, concerning the Word of the Life --
230102 and the Life was manifested, and we have seen, and do testify, and declare to you the Life, the age-during, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us --
230103 that which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ;
230104 and these things we write to you, that your joy may be full.
230105 And this is the message that we have heard from Him, and announce to you, that God is light, and darkness in Him is not at all;
230106 if we may say -- 'we have fellowship with Him,' and in the darkness may walk -- we lie, and do not the truth;
230107 and if in the light we may walk, as He is in the light -- we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son doth cleanse us from every sin;
230108 if we may say -- 'we have not sin,' ourselves we lead astray, and the truth is not in us;
230109 if we may confess our sins, stedfast He is and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from every unrighteousness;
230110 if we may say -- 'we have not sinned,' a liar we make Him, and His word is not in us.
230201 My little children, these things I write to you, that ye may not sin: and if any one may sin, an advocate we have with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one,
230202 and he -- he is a propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world,
230203 and in this we know that we have known him, if his commands we may keep;
230204 he who is saying, 'I have known him,' and his command is not keeping, a liar he is, and in him the truth is not;
230205 and whoever may keep his word, truly in him the love of God hath been perfected; in this we know that in him we are.
230206 He who is saying in him he doth remain, ought according as he walked also himself so to walk.
230207 Brethren, a new command I write not to you, but an old command, that ye had from the beginning -- the old command is the word that ye heard from the beginning;
230208 again, a new command I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness doth pass away, and the true light doth now shine;
230209 he who is saying, in the light he is, and his brother is hating, in the darkness he is till now;
230210 he who is loving his brother, in the light he doth remain, and a stumbling-block in him there is not;
230211 and he who is hating his brother, in the darkness he is, and in the darkness he doth walk, and he hath not known whither he doth go, because the darkness did blind his eyes.
230212 I write to you, little children, because the sins have been forgiven you through his name;
230213 I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who [is] from the beginning; I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil. I write to you, little youths, because ye have known the Father:
230214 I did write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who [is] from the beginning; I did write to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God in you doth remain, and ye have overcome the evil.
230215 Love not ye the world, nor the things in the world; if any one doth love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,
230216 because all that [is] in the world -- the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the ostentation of the life -- is not of the Father, but of the world,
230217 and the world doth pass away, and the desire of it, and he who is doing the will of God, he doth remain -- to the age.
230218 Little youths, it is the last hour; and even as ye heard that the antichrist doth come, even now antichrists have become many -- whence we know that it is the last hour;
230219 out of us they went forth, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but -- that they might be manifested that they are not all of us.
230220 And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and have known all things;
230221 I did not write to you because ye have not known the truth, but because ye have known it, and because no lie is of the truth.
230222 Who is the liar, except he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? this one is the antichrist who is denying the Father and the Son;
230223 every one who is denying the Son, neither hath he the Father, [he who is confessing the Son hath the Father also.]
230224 Ye, then, that which ye heard from the beginning, in you let it remain; if in you may remain that which from the beginning ye did hear, ye also in the Son and in the Father shall remain,
230225 and this is the promise that He did promise us -- the life the age-during.
230226 These things I did write to you concerning those leading you astray;
230227 and you, the anointing that ye did receive from him, in you it doth remain, and ye have no need that any one may teach you, but as the same anointing doth teach you concerning all, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as was taught you, ye shall remain in him.
230228 And now, little children, remain in him, that when he may be manifested, we may have boldness, and may not be ashamed before him, in his presence;
230229 if ye know that he is righteous, know ye that every one doing the righteousness, of him hath been begotten.
230301 See ye what love the Father hath given to us, that children of God we may be called; because of this the world doth not know us, because it did not know Him;
230302 beloved, now, children of God are we, and it was not yet manifested what we shall be, and we have known that if he may be manifested, like him we shall be, because we shall see him as he is;
230303 and every one who is having this hope on him, doth purify himself, even as he is pure.
230304 Every one who is doing the sin, the lawlessness also he doth do, and the sin is the lawlessness,
230305 and ye have known that he was manifested that our sins he may take away, and sin is not in him;
230306 every one who is remaining in him doth not sin; every one who is sinning, hath not seen him, nor known him.
230307 Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who is doing the righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous,
230308 he who is doing the sin, of the devil he is, because from the beginning the devil doth sin; for this was the Son of God manifested, that he may break up the works of the devil;
230309 every one who hath been begotten of God, sin he doth not, because his seed in him doth remain, and he is not able to sin, because of God he hath been begotten.
230310 In this manifest are the children of God, and the children of the devil; every one who is not doing righteousness, is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother,
230311 because this is the message that ye did hear from the beginning, that we may love one another,
230312 not as Cain -- of the evil one he was, and he did slay his brother, and wherefore did he slay him? because his works were evil, and those of his brother righteous.
230313 Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world doth hate you;
230314 we -- we have known that we have passed out of the death to the life, because we love the brethren; he who is not loving the brother doth remain in the death.
230315 Every one who is hating his brother -- a man-killer he is, and ye have known that no man-killer hath life age-during in him remaining,
230316 in this we have known the love, because he for us his life did lay down, and we ought for the brethren the lives to lay down;
230317 and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view his brother having need, and may shut up his bowels from him -- how doth the love of God remain in him?
230318 My little children, may we not love in word nor in tongue, but in word and in truth!
230319 and in this we know that of the truth we are, and before Him we shall assure our hearts,
230320 because if our heart may condemn -- because greater is God than our heart, and He doth know all things.
230321 Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness toward God,
230322 and whatever we may ask, we receive from Him, because His commands we keep, and the things pleasing before Him we do,
230323 and this is His command, that we may believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and may love one another, even as He did give command to us,
230324 and he who is keeping His commands, in Him he doth remain, and He in him; and in this we know that He doth remain in us, from the Spirit that He gave us.
230401 Beloved, every spirit believe not, but prove the spirits, if of God they are, because many false prophets have gone forth to the world;
230402 in this know ye the Spirit of God; every spirit that doth confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is,
230403 and every spirit that doth not confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is not; and this is that of the antichrist, which ye heard that it doth come, and now in the world it is already.
230404 Ye -- of God ye are, little children, and ye have overcome them; because greater is He who [is] in you, than he who is in the world.
230405 They -- of the world they are; because of this from the world they speak, and the world doth hear them;
230406 we -- of God we are; he who is knowing God doth hear us; he who is not of God, doth not hear us; from this we know the spirit of the truth, and the spirit of the error.
230407 Beloved, may we love one another, because the love is of God, and every one who is loving, of God he hath been begotten, and doth know God;
230408 he who is not loving did not know God, because God is love.
230409 In this was manifested the love of God in us, because His Son -- the only begotten -- hath God sent to the world, that we may live through him;
230410 in this is the love, not that we loved God, but that He did love us, and did send His Son a propitiation for our sins.
230411 Beloved, if thus did God love us, we also ought one another to love;
230412 God no one hath ever seen; if we may love one another, God in us doth remain, and His love is having been perfected in us;
230413 in this we know that in Him we do remain, and He in us, because of His Spirit He hath given us.
230414 And we -- we have seen and do testify, that the Father hath sent the Son -- Saviour of the world;
230415 whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God in him doth remain, and he in God;
230416 and we -- we have known and believed the love, that God hath in us; God is love, and he who is remaining in the love, in God he doth remain, and God in him.
230417 In this made perfect hath been the love with us, that boldness we may have in the day of the judgment, because even as He is, we -- we also are in this world;
230418 fear is not in the love, but the perfect love doth cast out the fear, because the fear hath punishment, and he who is fearing hath not been made perfect in the love;
230419 we -- we love him, because He -- He first loved us;
230420 if any one may say -- 'I love God,' and his brother he may hate, a liar he is; for he who is not loving his brother whom he hath seen, God -- whom he hath not seen -- how is he able to love?
230421 and this [is] the command we have from Him, that he who is loving God, may also love his brother.
230501 Every one who is believing that Jesus is the Christ, of God he hath been begotten, and every one who is loving Him who did beget, doth love also him who is begotten of Him:
230502 in this we know that we love the children of God, when we may love God, and His commands may keep;
230503 for this is the love of God, that His commands we may keep, and His commands are not burdensome;
230504 because every one who is begotten of God doth overcome the world, and this is the victory that did overcome the world -- our faith;
230505 who is he who is overcoming the world, if not he who is believing that Jesus is the Son of God?
230506 This one is he who did come through water and blood -- Jesus the Christ, not in the water only, but in the water and the blood; and the Spirit it is that is testifying, because the Spirit is the truth,
230507 because three are who are testifying [in the heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these -- the three -- are one;
230508 and three are who are testifying in the earth], the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, and the three are into the one.
230509 If the testimony of men we receive, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He hath testified concerning His Son.
230510 He who is believing in the Son of God, hath the testimony in himself; he who is not believing God, a liar hath made Him, because he hath not believed in the testimony that God hath testified concerning His Son;
230511 and this is the testimony, that life age-during did God give to us, and this -- the life -- is in His Son;
230512 he who is having the Son, hath the life; he who is not having the Son of God -- the life he hath not.
230513 These things I did write to you who are believing in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that life ye have age-during, and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God.
230514 And this is the boldness that we have toward Him, that if anything we may ask according to his will, He doth hear us,
230515 and if we have known that He doth hear us, whatever we may ask, we have known that we have the requests that we have requested from Him.
230516 If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and He shall give to him life to those sinning not unto death; there is sin to death, not concerning it do I speak that he may beseech;
230517 all unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death.
230518 We have known that every one who hath been begotten of God doth not sin, but he who was begotten of God doth keep himself, and the evil one doth not touch him;
230519 we have known that of God we are, and the whole world in the evil doth lie;
230520 and we have known that the Son of God is come, and hath given us a mind, that we may know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ; this one is the true God and the life age-during!
230521 Little children, guard yourselves from the idols! Amen.
240101 The Elder to the choice Kyria, and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those having known the truth,
240102 because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us shall be to the age,
240103 there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
240104 I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the Father;
240105 and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as writing to thee a new command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another,
240106 and this is the love, that we may walk according to His commands; this is the command, even as ye did hear from the beginning, that in it ye may walk,
240107 because many leading astray did enter into the world, who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is he who is leading astray, and the antichrist.
240108 See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we wrought, but a full reward may receive;
240109 every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is remaining in the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father and the Son;
240110 if any one doth come unto you, and this teaching doth not bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him, 'Hail!'
240111 for he who is saying to him, 'Hail,' hath fellowship with his evil works.
240112 Many things having to write to you, I did not intend through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;
240113 salute thee do the children of thy choice sister. Amen.
250101 The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!
250102 beloved, concerning all things I desire thee to prosper, and to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper,
250103 for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk;
250104 greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking.
250105 Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work to the brethren and to the strangers,
250106 who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,
250107 because for [His] name they went forth, nothing receiving from the nations;
250108 we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may become to the truth.
250109 I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them -- Diotrephes -- doth not receive us;
250110 because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast.
250111 Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil hath not seen God;
250112 to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all, and by the truth itself, and we also -- we do testify, and ye have known that our testimony is true.
250113 Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to thee,
250114 and I hope straightway to see thee, and mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to thee! salute thee do the friends; be saluting the friends by name.
260101 Judas, of Jesus Christ a servant, and brother of James, to those sanctified in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ kept -- called,
260102 kindness to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied!
260103 Beloved, all diligence using to write to you concerning the common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, exhorting to agonize for the faith once delivered to the saints,
260104 for there did come in unobserved certain men, long ago having been written beforehand to this judgment, impious, the grace of our God perverting to lasciviousness, and our only Master, God, and Lord -- Jesus Christ -- denying,
260105 and to remind you I intend, you knowing once this, that the Lord, a people out of the land of Egypt having saved, again those who did not believe did destroy;
260106 messengers also, those who did not keep their own principality, but did leave their proper dwelling, to a judgment of a great day, in bonds everlasting, under darkness He hath kept,
260107 as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, in like manner to these, having given themselves to whoredom, and gone after other flesh, have been set before -- an example, of fire age-during, justice suffering.
260108 In like manner, nevertheless, those dreaming also the flesh indeed do defile, and lordship they put away, and dignities they speak evil of,
260109 yet Michael, the chief messenger, when, with the devil contending, he was disputing about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring up an evil-speaking judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke thee!'
260110 and these, as many things indeed as they have not known, they speak evil of; and as many things as naturally (as the irrational beasts) they understand, in these they are corrupted;
260111 wo to them! because in the way of Cain they did go on, and to the deceit of Balaam for reward they did rush, and in the gainsaying of Korah they did perish.
260112 These are in your love-feasts craggy rocks; feasting together with you, without fear shepherding themselves; clouds without water, by winds carried about; trees autumnal, without fruit, twice dead, rooted up;
260113 wild waves of a sea, foaming out their own shames; stars going astray, to whom the gloom of the darkness to the age hath been kept.
260114 And prophesy also to these did the seventh from Adam -- Enoch -- saying, 'Lo, the Lord did come in His saintly myriads,
260115 to do judgment against all, and to convict all their impious ones, concerning all their works of impiety that they did impiously, and concerning all the stiff things that speak against Him did impious sinners.'
260116 These are murmurers, repiners; according to their desires walking, and their mouth doth speak great swellings, giving admiration to persons for the sake of profit;
260117 and ye, beloved, remember ye the sayings spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:
260118 that they said to you, that in the last time there shall be scoffers, after their own desires of impieties going on,
260119 these are those setting themselves apart, natural men, the Spirit not having.
260120 And ye, beloved, on your most holy faith building yourselves up, in the Holy Spirit praying,
260121 yourselves in the love of God keep ye, waiting for the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ -- to life age-during;
260122 and to some be kind, judging thoroughly,
260123 and some in fear save ye, out of the fire snatching, hating even the coat from the flesh spotted.
260124 And to Him who is able to guard you not stumbling, and to set [you] in the presence of His glory unblemished, in gladness,
260125 to the only wise God our Saviour, [is] glory and greatness, power and authority, both now and to all the ages! Amen.
270101 A revelation of Jesus Christ, that God gave to him, to shew to his servants what things it behoveth to come to pass quickly; and he did signify [it], having sent through his messenger to his servant John,
270102 who did testify the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as many things also as he did see.
270103 Happy is he who is reading, and those hearing, the words of the prophecy, and keeping the things written in it -- for the time is nigh!
270104 John to the seven assemblies that [are] in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the Seven Spirits that are before His throne,
270105 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born out of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth; to him who did love us, and did bathe us from our sins in his blood,
270106 and did make us kings and priests to his God and Father, to him [is] the glory and the power to the ages of the ages! Amen.
270107 Lo, he doth come with the clouds, and see him shall every eye, even those who did pierce him, and wail because of him shall all the tribes of the land. Yes! Amen!
270108 'I am the Alpha and the Omega, beginning and end, saith the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is coming -- the Almighty.'
270109 I, John, who also [am] your brother, and fellow-partner in the tribulation, and in the reign and endurance, of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, because of the word of God, and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ;
270110 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's-day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, saying,
270111 'I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last;' and, 'What thou dost see, write in a scroll, and send to the seven assemblies that [are] in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.'
270112 And I did turn to see the voice that did speak with me, and having turned, I saw seven golden lamp-stands,
270113 and in the midst of the seven lamp-stands, [one] like to a son of man, clothed to the foot, and girt round at the breast with a golden girdle,
270114 and his head and hairs white, as if white wool -- as snow, and his eyes as a flame of fire;
270115 and his feet like to fine brass, as in a furnace having been fired, and his voice as a sound of many waters,
270116 and having in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword is proceeding, and his countenance [is] as the sun shining in its might.
270117 And when I saw him, I did fall at his feet as dead, and he placed his right hand upon me, saying to me, 'Be not afraid; I am the First and the Last,
270118 and he who is living, and I did become dead, and, lo, I am living to the ages of the ages. Amen! and I have the keys of the hades and of the death.
270119 'Write the things that thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to come after these things;
270120 the secret of the seven stars that thou hast seen upon my right hand, and the seven golden lamp-stands: the seven stars are messengers of the seven assemblies, and the seven lamp-stands that thou hast seen are seven assemblies.
270201 'To the messenger of the Ephesian assembly write: These things saith he who is holding the seven stars in his right hand, who is walking in the midst of the seven lamp-stands -- the golden:
270202 I have known thy works, and thy labour, and thy endurance, and that thou art not able to bear evil ones, and that thou hast tried those saying themselves to be apostles and are not, and hast found them liars,
270203 and thou didst bear, and hast endurance, and because of my name hast toiled, and hast not been weary.
270204 'But I have against thee: That thy first love thou didst leave!
270205 remember, then, whence thou hast fallen, and reform, and the first works do; and if not, I come to thee quickly, and will remove thy lamp-stand from its place -- if thou mayest not reform;
270206 but this thou hast, that thou dost hate the works of the Nicolaitans, that I also hate.
270207 He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies: To him who is overcoming -- I will give to him to eat of the tree of life that is in the midst of the paradise of God.
270208 'And to the messenger of the assembly of the Smyrneans write: These things saith the First and the Last, who did become dead and did live;
270209 I have known thy works, and tribulation, and poverty -- yet thou art rich -- and the evil-speaking of those saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but [are] a synagogue of the Adversary.
270210 'Be not afraid of the things that thou art about to suffer; lo, the devil is about to cast of you to prison, that ye may be tried, and ye shall have tribulation ten days; become thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of the life.
270211 He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies: He who is overcoming may not be injured of the second death.
270212 'And to the messenger of the assembly in Pergamos write: These things saith he who is having the sharp two-edged sword:
270213 I have known thy works, and where thou dost dwell -- where the throne of the Adversary [is] -- and thou dost hold fast my name, and thou didst not deny my faith, even in the days in which Antipas [was] my faithful witness, who was put to death beside you, where the Adversary doth dwell.
270214 'But I have against thee a few things: That thou hast there those holding the teaching of Balaam, who did teach Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol-sacrifices, and to commit whoredom;
270215 so hast thou, even thou, those holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans -- which thing I hate.
270216 'Reform! and if not, I come to thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
270217 He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies: To him who is overcoming, I will give to him to eat from the hidden manna, and will give to him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, that no one knew except him who is receiving [it].
270218 'And to the messenger of the assembly of Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who is having his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like to fine brass;
270219 I have known thy works, and love, and ministration, and faith, and thy endurance, and thy works -- and the last [are] more than the first.
270220 'But I have against thee a few things: That thou dost suffer the woman Jezebel, who is calling herself a prophetess, to teach, and to lead astray, my servants to commit whoredom, and idol-sacrifices to eat;
270221 and I did give to her a time that she might reform from her whoredom, and she did not reform;
270222 lo, I will cast her into a couch, and those committing adultery with her into great tribulation -- if they may not repent of their works,
270223 and her children I will kill in death, and know shall all the assemblies that I am he who is searching reins and hearts; and I will give to you -- to each -- according to your works.
270224 'And to you I say, and to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, and who did not know the depths of the Adversary, as they say; I will not put upon you other burden;
270225 but that which ye have -- hold ye, till I may come;
270226 and he who is overcoming, and who is keeping unto the end my works, I will give to him authority over the nations,
270227 and he shall rule them with a rod of iron -- as the vessels of the potter they shall be broken -- as I also have received from my Father;
270228 and I will give to him the morning star.
270229 He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies.
270301 And to the messenger of the assembly in Sardis write: These things saith he who is having the Seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I have known thy works, and that thou hast the name that thou dost live, and thou art dead;
270302 become watching, and strengthen the rest of the things that are about to die, for I have not found thy works fulfilled before God.
270303 'Remember, then, how thou hast received, and heard, and be keeping, and reform: if, then, thou mayest not watch, I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou mayest not know what hour I will come upon thee.
270304 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis who did not defile their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy.
270305 He who is overcoming -- this one -- shall be arrayed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the scroll of the life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before His messengers.
270306 He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies.
270307 'And to the messenger of the assembly in Philadelphia write: These things saith he who is holy, he who is true, he who is having the key of David, he who is opening and no one doth shut, and he shutteth and no one doth open!
270308 I have known thy works; lo, I have set before thee a door -- opened, and no one is able to shut it, because thou hast a little power, and didst keep my word, and didst not deny my name;
270309 lo, I make of the synagogue of the Adversary those saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but do lie; lo, I will make them that they may come and bow before thy feet, and may know that I loved thee.
270310 'Because thou didst keep the word of my endurance, I also will keep thee from the hour of the trial that is about to come upon all the world, to try those dwelling upon the earth.
270311 Lo, I come quickly, be holding fast that which thou hast, that no one may receive thy crown.
270312 He who is overcoming -- I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of my God, and without he may not go any more, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, that doth come down out of the heaven from my God -- also my new name.
270313 He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies.
270314 'And to the messenger of the assembly of the Laodiceans write: These things saith the Amen, the witness -- the faithful and true -- the chief of the creation of God;
270315 I have known thy works, that neither cold art thou nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot.
270316 So -- because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to vomit thee out of my mouth;
270317 because thou sayest -- I am rich, and have grown rich, and have need of nothing, and hast not known that thou art the wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked,
270318 I counsel thee to buy from me gold fired by fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white garments that thou mayest be arrayed, and the shame of thy nakedness may not be manifest, and with eye-salve anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see.
270319 'As many as I love, I do convict and chasten; be zealous, then, and reform;
270320 lo, I have stood at the door, and I knock; if any one may hear my voice, and may open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
270321 He who is overcoming -- I will give to him to sit with me in my throne, as I also did overcome and did sit down with my Father in His throne.
270322 He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies.'
270401 After these things I saw, and lo, a door opened in the heaven, and the first voice that I heard [is] as of a trumpet speaking with me, saying, 'Come up hither, and I will shew thee what it behoveth to come to pass after these things;'
270402 and immediately I was in the Spirit, and lo, a throne was set in the heaven, and upon the throne is [one] sitting,
270403 and He who is sitting was in sight like a stone, jasper and sardine: and a rainbow was round the throne in sight like an emerald.
270404 And around the throne [are] thrones twenty and four, and upon the thrones I saw the twenty and four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and they had upon their heads crowns of gold;
270405 and out of the throne proceed do lightnings, and thunders, and voices; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the Seven Spirits of God,
270406 and before the throne [is] a sea of glass like to crystal, and in the midst of the throne, and round the throne, [are] four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind;
270407 and the first living creature [is] like a lion, and the second living creature [is] like a calf, and the third living creature hath the face as a man, and the fourth living creature [is] like an eagle flying.
270408 And the four living creatures, each by itself severally, had six wings, around and within [are] full of eyes, and rest they have not day and night, saying, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming;'
270409 and when the living creatures do give glory, and honour, and thanks, to Him who is sitting upon the throne, who is living to the ages of the ages,
270410 fall down do the twenty and four elders before Him who is sitting upon the throne, and bow before Him who is living to the ages of the ages, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
270411 'Worthy art Thou, O Lord, to receive the glory, and the honour, and the power, because Thou -- Thou didst create the all things, and because of Thy will are they, and they were created.'
270501 And I saw upon the right hand of Him who is sitting upon the throne a scroll, written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals;
270502 and I saw a strong messenger crying with a great voice, 'Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose the seals of it?'
270503 and no one was able in the heaven, nor upon the earth, nor under the earth, to open the scroll, nor to behold it.
270504 And I was weeping much, because no one was found worthy to open and to read the scroll, nor to behold it,
270505 and one of the elders saith to me, 'Weep not; lo, overcome did the Lion, who is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, to open the scroll, and to loose the seven seals of it;
270506 and I saw, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb hath stood as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the Seven Spirits of God, which are sent to all the earth,
270507 and he came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who is sitting upon the throne.
270508 And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, having each one harps and golden vials full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints,
270509 and they sing a new song, saying, 'Worthy art thou to take the scroll, and to open the seals of it, because thou wast slain, and didst redeem us to God in thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,
270510 and didst make us to our God kings and priests, and we shall reign upon the earth.'
270511 And I saw, and I heard the voice of many messengers round the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders -- and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands --
270512 saying with a great voice, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing!'
270513 and every creature that is in the heaven, and in the earth, and under the earth, and the things that are upon the sea, and the all things in them, heard I saying, 'To Him who is sitting upon the throne, and to the Lamb, [is] the blessing, and the honour, and the glory, and the might -- to the ages of the ages!'
270514 and the four living creatures said, 'Amen!' and the twenty-four elders fell down and they bow before Him who is living to the ages of the ages.
270601 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as it were a voice of thunder, 'Come and behold!'
270602 and I saw, and lo, a white horse, and he who is sitting upon it is having a bow, and there was given to him a crown, and he went forth overcoming, and that he may overcome.
270603 And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, 'Come and behold!'
270604 and there went forth another horse -- red, and to him who is sitting upon it, there was given to him to take the peace from the land, and that one another they may slay, and there was given to him a great sword.
270605 And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, 'Come and behold!' and I saw, and lo, a black horse, and he who is sitting upon it is having a balance in his hand,
270606 and I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, 'A measure of wheat for a denary, and three measures of barley for a denary,' and 'The oil and the wine thou mayest not injure.'
270607 And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, 'Come and behold!'
270608 and I saw, and lo, a pale horse, and he who is sitting upon him -- his name is Death, and Hades doth follow with him, and there was given to them authority to kill, (over the fourth part of the land,) with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and by the beasts of the land.
270609 And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony that they held,
270610 and they were crying with a great voice, saying, 'Till when, O Master, the Holy and the True, dost Thou not judge and take vengeance of our blood from those dwelling upon the land?'
270611 and there was given to each one white robes, and it was said to them that they may rest themselves yet a little time, till may be fulfilled also their fellow-servants and their brethren, who are about to be killed -- even as they.
270612 And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and lo, a great earthquake came, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood,
270613 and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth -- as a fig-tree doth cast her winter figs, by a great wind being shaken --
270614 and heaven departed as a scroll rolled up, and every mountain and island -- out of their places they were moved;
270615 and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chiefs of thousands, and the mighty, and every servant, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains,
270616 and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, 'Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of Him who is sitting upon the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb,'
270617 because come did the great day of His anger, and who is able to stand?
270701 And after these things I saw four messengers, standing upon the four corners of the land, holding the four winds of the land, that the wind may not blow upon the land, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree;
270702 and I saw another messenger going up from the rising of the sun, having a seal of the living God, and he did cry with a great voice to the four messengers, to whom it was given to injure the land and the sea, saying,
270703 'Do not injure the land, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we may seal the servants of our God upon their foreheads.'
270704 And I heard the number of those sealed, (144 thousands were sealed out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel):
270705 of the tribe of Judah 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad 12 thousand were sealed;
270706 of the tribe of Asher 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh 12 thousand were sealed;
270707 of the tribe of Simeon 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar 12 thousand were sealed;
270708 of the tribe of Zebulun 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin 12 thousand were sealed.
270709 After these things I saw, and lo, a great multitude, which to number no one was able, out of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands,
270710 and crying with a great voice, saying, 'The salvation [is] to Him who is sitting upon the throne -- to our God, and to the Lamb!'
270711 And all the messengers stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell upon their face, and bowed before God,
270712 saying, 'Amen! the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power, and the strength, [are] to our God -- to the ages of the ages! Amen!'
270713 And answer did one of the elders, saying to me, 'These, who have been arrayed with the white robes -- who are they, and whence came they?'
270714 and I have said to him, 'Sir, thou hast known;' and he said to me, 'These are those who are coming out of the great tribulation, and they did wash their robes, and they made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb;
270715 because of this are they before the throne of God, and they do service to Him day and night in His sanctuary, and He who is sitting upon the throne shall tabernacle over them;
270716 they shall not hunger any more, nor may the sun fall upon them, nor any heat,
270717 because the Lamb that [is] in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and wipe away shall God every tear from their eyes.'
270801 And when he openeth the seventh seal, there came silence in the heaven about half-an-hour,
270802 and I saw the seven messengers who before God have stood, and there were given to them seven trumpets,
270803 and another messenger did come, and he stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given to him much perfume, that he may give [it] to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that [is] before the throne,
270804 and go up did the smoke of the perfumes to the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the messenger, before God;
270805 and the messenger took the censer, and did fill it out of the fire of the altar, and did cast [it] to the earth, and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
270806 And the seven messengers who are having the seven trumpets did prepare themselves that they may sound;
270807 and the first messenger did sound, and there came hail and fire, mingled with blood, and it was cast to the land, and the third of the trees was burnt up, and all the green grass was burnt up.
270808 And the second messenger did sound, and as it were a great mountain with fire burning was cast into the sea, and the third of the sea became blood,
270809 and die did the third of the creatures that [are] in the sea, those having life, and the third of the ships were destroyed.
270810 And the third messenger did sound, and there fell out of the heaven a great star, burning as a lamp, and it did fall upon the third of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters,
270811 and the name of the star is called Wormwood, and the third of the waters doth become wormwood, and many of the men did die of the waters, because they were made bitter.
270812 And the fourth messenger did sound, and smitten was the third of the sun, and the third of the moon, and the third of the stars, that darkened may be the third of them, and that the day may not shine -- the third of it, and the night in like manner.
270813 And I saw, and I heard one messenger, flying in the mid-heaven, saying with a great voice, 'Wo, wo, wo, to those dwelling upon the land from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three messengers who are about to sound.'
270901 And the fifth messenger did sound, and I saw a star out of the heaven having fallen to the earth, and there was given to it the key of the pit of the abyss,
270902 and he did open the pit of the abyss, and there came up a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace, and darkened was the sun and the air, from the smoke of the pit.
270903 And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and there was given to them authority, as scorpions of the earth have authority,
270904 and it was said to them that they may not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but -- the men only who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads,
270905 and it was given to them that they may not kill them, but that they may be tormented five months, and their torment [is] as the torment of a scorpion, when it may strike a man;
270906 and in those days shall men seek the death, and they shall not find it, and they shall desire to die, and the death shall flee from them.
270907 And the likenesses of the locusts [are] like to horses made ready to battle, and upon their heads as crowns like gold, and their faces as faces of men,
270908 and they had hair as hair of women, and their teeth were as [those] of lions,
270909 and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings [is] as the noise of chariots of many horses running to battle;
270910 and they have tails like to scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their authority [is] to injure men five months;
270911 and they have over them a king -- the messenger of the abyss -- a name [is] to him in Hebrew, Abaddon, and in the Greek he hath a name, Apollyon.
270912 The first wo did go forth, lo, there come yet two woes after these things.
270913 And the sixth messenger did sound, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the altar of gold that is before God,
270914 saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet, 'Loose the four messengers who are bound at the great river Euphrates;'
270915 and loosed were the four messengers, who have been made ready for the hour, and day, and month, and year, that they may kill the third of men;
270916 and the number of the forces of the horsemen [is] two myriads of myriads, and I heard the number of them.
270917 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting upon them, having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses [are] as heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceedeth fire, and smoke, and brimstone;
270918 by these three were the third of men killed, from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the brimstone, that is proceeding out of their mouth,
270919 for their authorities are in their mouth, and in their tails, for their tails [are] like serpents, having heads, and with them they do injure;
270920 and the rest of men, who were not killed in these plagues, neither did reform from the works of their hands, that they may not bow before the demons, and idols, those of gold, and those of silver, and those of brass, and those of stone, and those of wood, that are neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk,
270921 yea they did not reform from their murders, nor from their sorceries, nor from their whoredoms, nor from their thefts.
271001 And I saw another strong messenger coming down out of the heaven, arrayed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon the head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire,
271002 and he had in his hand a little scroll opened, and he did place his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the land,
271003 and he cried with a great voice, as a lion doth roar, and when he cried, speak out did the seven thunders their voices;
271004 and when the seven thunders spake their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, 'Seal the things that the seven thunders spake,' and, 'Thou mayest not write these things.'
271005 And the messenger whom I saw standing upon the sea, and upon the land, did lift up his hand to the heaven,
271006 and did swear in Him who doth live to the ages of the ages, who did create the heaven and the things in it, and the land and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it -- that time shall not be yet,
271007 but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, when he may be about to sound, and the secret of God may be finished, as He did declare to His own servants, to the prophets.
271008 And the voice that I heard out of the heaven is again speaking with me, and saying, 'Go, take the little scroll that is open in the hand of the messenger who hath been standing upon the sea, and upon the land:'
271009 and I went away unto the messenger, saying to him, 'Give me the little scroll;' and he saith to me, 'Take, and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet -- as honey.'
271010 And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the messenger, and did eat it up, and it was in my mouth as honey -- sweet, and when I did eat it -- my belly was made bitter;
271011 and he saith to me, 'It behoveth thee again to prophesy about peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings -- many.'
271101 And there was given to me a reed like to a rod, and the messenger stood, saying, 'Rise, and measure the sanctuary of God, and the altar, and those worshipping in it;
271102 and the court that is without the sanctuary leave out, and thou mayest not measure it, because it was given to the nations, and the holy city they shall tread down forty-two months;
271103 and I will give to My two witnesses, and they shall prophesy days, a thousand, two hundred, sixty, arrayed with sackcloth;
271104 these are the two olive [trees], and the two lamp-stands that before the God of the earth do stand;
271105 and if any one may will to injure them, fire doth proceed out of their mouth, and doth devour their enemies, and if any one may will to injure them, thus it behoveth him to be killed.
271106 These have authority to shut the heaven, that it may not rain rain in the days of their prophecy, and authority they have over the waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the land with every plague, as often as they may will.
271107 'And when they may finish their testimony, the beast that is coming up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them,
271108 and their dead bodies [are] upon the broad-place of the great city (that is called spiritually Sodom, and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified,)
271109 and they shall behold -- they of the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations -- their dead bodies three days and a half, and their dead bodies they shall not suffer to be put into tombs,
271110 and those dwelling upon the land shall rejoice over them, and shall make merry, and gifts they shall send to one another, because these -- the two prophets -- did torment those dwelling upon the land.'
271111 And after the three days and a half, a spirit of life from God did enter into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those beholding them,
271112 and they heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, 'Come up hither;' and they went up to the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them;
271113 and in that hour came a great earthquake, and the tenth of the city did fall, and killed in the earthquake were names of men -- seven thousands, and the rest became affrighted, and they gave glory to the God of the heaven.
271114 The second wo did go forth, lo, the third wo doth come quickly.
271115 And the seventh messenger did sound, and there came great voices in the heaven, saying, 'The kingdoms of the world did become [those] of our Lord and of His Christ, and he shall reign to the ages of the ages!'
271116 and the twenty and four elders, who before God are sitting upon their thrones, did fall upon their faces, and did bow before God,
271117 saying, 'We give thanks to Thee, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art, and who wast, and who art coming, because Thou hast taken Thy great power and didst reign;
271118 and the nations were angry, and Thine anger did come, and the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give the reward to Thy servants, to the prophets, and to the saints, and to those fearing Thy name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the land.'
271119 And opened was the sanctuary of God in the heaven, and there was seen the ark of His covenant in His sanctuary, and there did come lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.
271201 And a great sign was seen in the heaven, a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars,
271202 and being with child she doth cry out, travailing and pained to bring forth.
271203 And there was seen another sign in the heaven, and, lo, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems,
271204 and his tail doth draw the third of the stars of the heaven, and he did cast them to the earth; and the dragon did stand before the woman who is about to bring forth, that when she may bring forth, her child he may devour;
271205 and she brought forth a male child, who is about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, and caught away was her child unto God and His throne,
271206 and the woman did flee to the wilderness, where she hath a place made ready from God, that there they may nourish her -- days a thousand, two hundred, sixty.
271207 And there came war in the heaven; Michael and his messengers did war against the dragon, and the dragon did war, and his messengers,
271208 and they did not prevail, nor was their place found any more in the heaven;
271209 and the great dragon was cast forth -- the old serpent, who is called 'Devil,' and 'the Adversary,' who is leading astray the whole world -- he was cast forth to the earth, and his messengers were cast forth with him.
271210 And I heard a great voice saying in the heaven, 'Now did come the salvation, and the power, and the reign, of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because cast down was the accuser of our brethren, who is accusing them before our God day and night;
271211 and they did overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life -- unto death;
271212 because of this be glad, ye heavens, and those in them who do tabernacle; wo to those inhabiting the land and the sea, because the Devil did go down unto you, having great wrath, having known that he hath little time.'
271213 And when the dragon saw that he was cast forth to the earth, he pursued the woman who did bring forth the male,
271214 and there were given to the woman two wings of the great eagle, that she may fly to the wilderness, to her place, where she is nourished a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent;
271215 and the serpent did cast forth after the woman, out of his mouth, water as a river, that he may cause her to be carried away by the river,
271216 and the land did help the woman, and the land did open its mouth and did swallow up the river, that the dragon did cast forth out of his mouth;
271217 and the dragon was angry against the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commands of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ.
271301 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw out of the sea a beast coming up, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon its horns ten diadems, and upon its heads a name of evil speaking,
271302 and the beast that I saw was like to a leopard, and its feet as of a bear, and its mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon did give to it his power, and his throne, and great authority.
271303 And I saw one of its heads as slain to death, and its deadly stroke was healed, and all the earth did wonder after the beast,
271304 and they did bow before the dragon who did give authority to the beast, and they did bow before the beast, saying, 'Who [is] like to the beast? who is able to war with it?'
271305 And there was given to it a mouth speaking great things, and evil-speakings, and there was given to it authority to make war forty-two months,
271306 and it did open its mouth for evil-speaking toward God, to speak evil of His name, and of His tabernacle, and of those who in the heaven tabernacle,
271307 and there was given to it to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and there was given to it authority over every tribe, and tongue, and nation.
271308 And bow before it shall all who are dwelling upon the land, whose names have not been written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world;
271309 if any one hath an ear -- let him hear:
271310 if any one a captivity doth gather, into captivity he doth go away; if any one by sword doth kill, it behoveth him by sword to be killed; here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
271311 And I saw another beast coming up out of the land, and it had two horns, like a lamb, and it was speaking as a dragon,
271312 and all the authority of the first beast doth it do before it, and it maketh the land and those dwelling in it that they shall bow before the first beast, whose deadly stroke was healed,
271313 and it doth great signs, that fire also it may make to come down from the heaven to the earth before men,
271314 and it leadeth astray those dwelling on the land, because of the signs that were given it to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling upon the land to make an image to the beast that hath the stroke of the sword and did live,
271315 and there was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast, that also the image of the beast may speak, and [that] it may cause as many as shall not bow before the image of the beast, that they may be killed.
271316 And it maketh all, the small, and the great, and the rich, and the poor, and the freemen, and the servants, that it may give to them a mark upon their right hand or upon their foreheads,
271317 and that no one may be able to buy, or to sell, except he who is having the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
271318 Here is the wisdom! He who is having the understanding, let him count the number of the beast, for the number of a man it is, and its number [is] 666.
271401 And I saw, and lo, a Lamb having stood upon the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousands, having the name of his Father written upon their foreheads;
271402 and I heard a voice out of the heaven, as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder, and a voice I heard of harpers harping with their harps,
271403 and they sing, as it were, a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders, and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred forty-four thousands, who have been bought from the earth;
271404 these are they who with women were not defiled, for they are virgin; these are they who are following the Lamb whithersoever he may go; these were bought from among men -- a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb --
271405 and in their mouth there was not found guile, for unblemished are they before the throne of God.
271406 And I saw another messenger flying in mid-heaven, having good news age-during to proclaim to those dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,
271407 saying in a great voice, 'Fear ye God, and give to Him glory, because come did the hour of His judgment, and bow ye before Him who did make the heaven, and the land, and sea, and fountains of waters.'
271408 And another messenger did follow, saying, 'Fall, fall, did Babylon, the great city, because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom she hath given to all nations to drink.'
271409 And a third messenger did follow them, saying in a great voice, 'If any one the beast doth bow before, and his image, and doth receive a mark upon his forehead, or upon his hand,
271410 he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, that hath been mingled unmixed in the cup of His anger, and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy messengers, and before the Lamb,
271411 and the smoke of their torment doth go up to ages of ages; and they have no rest day and night, who are bowing before the beast and his image, also if any doth receive the mark of his name.
271412 Here is endurance of the saints: here [are] those keeping the commands of God, and the faith of Jesus.'
271413 And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, 'Write: Happy are the dead who in the Lord are dying from this time!' 'Yes, (saith the Spirit,) That they may rest from their labours -- and their works do follow them!'
271414 And I saw, and lo, a white cloud, and upon the cloud [one] sitting like to a son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle;
271415 and another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary crying in a great voice to him who is sitting upon the cloud, 'Send forth thy sickle and reap, because come to thee hath the hour of reaping, because ripe hath been the harvest of the earth;'
271416 and he who is sitting upon the cloud did put forth his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.
271417 And another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary that [is] in the heaven, having -- he also -- a sharp sickle,
271418 and another messenger did come forth out from the altar, having authority over the fire, and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, 'Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, because come to perfection have her grapes;'
271419 and the messenger did put forth his sickle to the earth, and did gather the vine of the earth, and did cast [it] to the great wine-press of the wrath of God;
271420 and trodden was the wine-press outside of the city, and blood did come forth out of the wine-press -- unto the bridles of the horses, a thousand, six hundred furlongs.
271501 And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful, seven messengers having the seven last plagues, because in these was completed the wrath of God,
271502 and I saw as a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who do gain the victory over the beast, and his image, and his mark, [and] the number of his name, standing by the sea of the glass, having harps of God,
271503 and they sing the song of Moses, servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, 'Great and wonderful [are] Thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty, righteous and true [are] Thy ways, O King of saints,
271504 who may not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? because Thou alone [art] kind, because all the nations shall come and bow before Thee, because Thy righteous acts were manifested.'
271505 And after these things I saw, and lo, opened was the sanctuary of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven;
271506 and come forth did the seven messengers having the seven plagues, out of the sanctuary, clothed in linen, pure and shining, and girded round the breasts with golden girdles:
271507 and one of the four living creatures did give to the seven messengers seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who is living to the ages of the ages;
271508 and filled was the sanctuary with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power, and no one was able to enter into the sanctuary till the seven plagues of the seven messengers may be finished.
271601 And I heard a great voice out of the sanctuary saying to the seven messengers, 'Go away, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God to the earth;'
271602 and the first did go away, and did pour out his vial upon the land, and there came a sore -- bad and grievous -- to men, those having the mark of the beast, and those bowing to his image.
271603 And the second messenger did pour out his vial to the sea, and there came blood as of [one] dead, and every living soul died in the sea.
271604 And the third messenger did pour out his vial to the rivers, and to the fountains of the waters, and there came blood,
271605 and I heard the messenger of the waters, saying, 'righteous, O Lord, art Thou, who art, and who wast, and who shalt be, because these things Thou didst judge,
271606 because blood of saints and prophets they did pour out, and blood to them Thou didst give to drink, for they are worthy;'
271607 and I heard another out of the altar, saying, 'Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous [are] Thy judgments.'
271608 And the fourth messenger did pour out his vial upon the sun, and there was given to him to scorch men with fire,
271609 and men were scorched with great heat, and they did speak evil of the name of God, who hath authority over these plagues, and they did not reform -- to give to Him glory.
271610 And the fifth messenger did pour out his vial upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom did become darkened, and they were gnawing their tongues from the pain,
271611 and they did speak evil of the God of the heaven, from their pains, and from their sores, and they did not reform from their works.
271612 And the sixth messenger did pour out his vial upon the great river, the Euphrates, and dried up was its water, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun may be made ready;
271613 and I saw [come] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs --
271614 for they are spirits of demons, doing signs -- which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God the Almighty; --
271615 'lo, I do come as a thief; happy [is] he who is watching, and keeping his garments, that he may not walk naked, and they may see his unseemliness,' --
271616 and they did bring them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon.
271617 And the seventh messenger did pour out his vial to the air, and there came forth a great voice from the sanctuary of the heaven, from the throne, saying, 'It hath come!'
271618 and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and a great earthquake came, such as came not since men came upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake -- so great!
271619 And it came -- the great city -- into three parts, and the cities of the nations did fall, and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the wrath of His anger,
271620 and every island did flee away, and mountains were not found,
271621 and great hail (as of talent weight) doth come down out of the heaven upon men, and men did speak evil of God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague is very great.
271701 And there came one of the seven messengers, who were having the seven vials, and he spake with me, saying to me, 'Come, I will shew to thee the judgment of the great whore, who is sitting upon the many waters,
271702 with whom the kings of the earth did commit whoredom; and made drunk from the wine of her whoredom were those inhabiting the earth;'
271703 and he carried me away to a wilderness in the Spirit, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of evil-speaking, having seven heads and ten horns,
271704 and the woman was arrayed with purple and scarlet-colour, and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom,
271705 and upon her forehead was a name written: 'Secret, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Whores, and the Abominations of the earth.'
271706 And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the saints, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, and I did wonder -- having seen her -- with great wonder;
271707 and the messenger said to me, 'Wherefore didst thou wonder? I -- I will tell thee the secret of the woman and of the beast that [is] carrying her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.
271708 'The beast that thou didst see: it was, and it is not; and it is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go away to destruction, and wonder shall those dwelling upon the earth, whose names have not been written upon the scroll of the life from the foundation of the world, beholding the beast that was, and is not, although it is.
271709 'Here [is] the mind that is having wisdom; the seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman doth sit,
271710 and there are seven kings, the five did fall, and the one is, the other did not yet come, and when he may come, it behoveth him to remain a little time;
271711 and the beast that was, and is not, he also is eighth, and out of the seven he is, and to destruction he doth go away.
271712 'And the ten horns that thou sawest, are ten kings, who a kingdom did not yet receive, but authority as kings the same hour do receive with the beast,
271713 these have one mind, and their own power and authority to the beast they shall give over;
271714 these with the Lamb shall make war, and the Lamb shall overcome them, because Lord of lords he is, and King of kings, and those with him are called, and choice, and stedfast.'
271715 And he saith to me, 'The waters that thou didst see, where the whore doth sit, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues;'
271716 and the ten horns that thou didst see upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her in fire,
271717 for God did give into their hearts to do its mind, and to make one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast till the sayings of God may be complete,
271718 and the woman that thou didst see is the great city that is having reign over the kings of the land.'
271801 And after these things I saw another messenger coming down out of the heaven, having great authority, and the earth was lightened from his glory,
271802 and he did cry in might -- a great voice, saying, 'Fall, fall did Babylon the great, and she became a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird,
271803 because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom have all the nations drunk, and the kings of the earth with her did commit whoredom, and merchants of the earth from the power of her revel were made rich.
271804 And I heard another voice out of the heaven, saying, 'Come forth out of her, My people, that ye may not partake with her sins, and that ye may not receive of her plagues,
271805 because her sins did follow -- unto the heaven, and God did remember her unrighteousness.
271806 Render to her as also she did render to you, and double to her doubles according to her works; in the cup that she did mingle mingle to her double.
271807 'As much as she did glorify herself and did revel, so much torment and sorrow give to her, because in her heart she saith, I sit a queen, and a widow I am not, and sorrow I shall not see;
271808 because of this, in one day, shall come her plagues, death, and sorrow, and famine; and in fire she shall be utterly burned, because strong [is] the Lord God who is judging her;
271809 and weep over her, and smite themselves for her, shall the kings of the earth, who with her did commit whoredom and did revel, when they may see the smoke of her burning,
271810 from afar having stood because of the fear of her torment, saying, Wo, wo, the great city! Babylon, the strong city! because in one hour did come thy judgment.
271811 'And the merchants of the earth shall weep and sorrow over her, because their lading no one doth buy any more;
271812 lading of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyne wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood, and brass, and iron, and marble,
271813 and cinnamon, and odours, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies and souls of men.
271814 'And the fruits of the desire of thy soul did go away from thee, and all things -- the dainty and the bright -- did go away from thee, and no more at all mayest thou find them.
271815 The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, far off shall stand because of the fear of her torment, weeping, and sorrowing,
271816 and saying, Wo, wo, the great city, that was arrayed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and gilded in gold, and precious stone, and pearls -- because in one hour so much riches were made waste!
271817 'And every shipmaster, and all the company upon the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, far off stood,
271818 and were crying, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city is] like to the great city?
271819 and they did cast dust upon their heads, and were crying out, weeping and sorrowing, saying, Wo, wo, the great city! in which were made rich all having ships in the sea, out of her costliness -- for in one hour was she made waste.
271820 'Be glad over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, because God did judge your judgment of her!'
271821 And one strong messenger did take up a stone as a great millstone, and did cast [it] to the sea, saying, 'Thus with violence shall Babylon be cast, the great city, and may not be found any more at all;
271822 and voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, may not be heard at all in thee any more; and any artizan of any art may not be found at all in thee any more; and noise of a millstone may not be heard at all in thee any more;
271823 and light of a lamp may not shine at all in thee any more; and voice of bridegroom and of bride may not be heard at all in thee any more; because thy merchants were the great ones of the earth, because in thy sorcery were all the nations led astray,
271824 and in her blood of prophets and of saints was found, and of all those who have been slain on the earth.'
271901 And after these things I heard a great voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, 'Alleluia! the salvation, and the glory, and the honour, and the power, [is] to the Lord our God;
271902 because true and righteous [are] His judgments, because He did judge the great whore who did corrupt the earth in her whoredom, and He did avenge the blood of His servants at her hand;'
271903 and a second time they said, 'Alleluia;' and her smoke doth come up -- to the ages of the ages!
271904 And fall down did the elders -- the twenty and four -- and the four living creatures, and they did bow before God who is sitting upon the throne, saying, 'Amen, Alleluia.'
271905 And a voice out of the throne did come forth, saying, 'Praise our God, all ye His servants, and those fearing Him, both the small and the great;'
271906 and I heard as the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, 'Alleluia! because reign did the Lord God -- the Almighty!
271907 may we rejoice and exult, and give the glory to Him, because come did the marriage of the Lamb, and his wife did make herself ready;
271908 and there was given to her that she may be arrayed with fine linen, pure and shining, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.'
271909 And he saith to me, 'Write: Happy [are] they who to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb have been called;' and he saith to me, 'These [are] the true words of God;'
271910 and I fell before his feet, to bow before him, and he saith to me, 'See -- not! fellow servant of thee am I, and of thy brethren, those having the testimony of Jesus; bow before God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.'
271911 And I saw the heaven having been opened, and lo, a white horse, and he who is sitting upon it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness doth he judge and war,
271912 and his eyes [are] as a flame of fire, and upon his head [are] many diadems -- having a name written that no one hath known, except himself,
271913 and he is arrayed with a garment covered with blood, and his name is called, The Word of God.
271914 And the armies in the heaven were following him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen -- white and pure;
271915 and out of his mouth doth proceed a sharp sword, that with it he may smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he doth tread the press of the wine of the wrath and the anger of God the Almighty,
271916 and he hath upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written, 'King of kings, and Lord of lords.'
271917 And I saw one messenger standing in the sun, and he cried, a great voice, saying to all the birds that are flying in mid-heaven, 'Come and be gathered together to the supper of the great God,
271918 that ye may eat flesh of kings, and flesh of chiefs of thousands, and flesh of strong men, and flesh of horses, and of those sitting on them, and the flesh of all -- freemen and servants -- both small and great.'
271919 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, having been gathered together to make war with him who is sitting upon the horse, and with his army;
271920 and the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him, in which he led astray those who did receive the mark of the beast, and those who did bow before his image; living they were cast -- the two -- to the lake of the fire, that is burning with brimstone;
271921 and the rest were killed with the sword of him who is sitting on the horse, which [sword] is proceeding out of his mouth, and all the birds were filled out of their flesh.
272001 And I saw a messenger coming down out of the heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain over his hand,
272002 and he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, who is Devil and Adversary, and did bind him a thousand years,
272003 and he cast him to the abyss, and did shut him up, and put a seal upon him, that he may not lead astray the nations any more, till the thousand years may be finished; and after these it behoveth him to be loosed a little time.
272004 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them, and the souls of those who have been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God, and who did not bow before the beast, nor his image, and did not receive the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand, and they did live and reign with Christ the thousand years;
272005 and the rest of the dead did not live again till the thousand years may be finished; this [is] the first rising again.
272006 Happy and holy [is] he who is having part in the first rising again; over these the second death hath not authority, but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
272007 And when the thousand years may be finished, the Adversary shall be loosed out of his prison,
272008 and he shall go forth to lead the nations astray, that are in the four corners of the earth -- Gog and Magog -- to gather them together to war, of whom the number [is] as the sand of the sea;
272009 and they did go up over the breadth of the land, and did surround the camp of the saints, and the beloved city, and there came down fire from God out of the heaven, and devoured them;
272010 and the Devil, who is leading them astray, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where [are] the beast and the false prophet, and they shall be tormented day and night -- to the ages of the ages.
272011 And I saw a great white throne, and Him who is sitting upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven did flee away, and place was not found for them;
272012 and I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and scrolls were opened, and another scroll was opened, which is that of the life, and the dead were judged out of the things written in the scrolls -- according to their works;
272013 and the sea did give up those dead in it, and the death and the hades did give up the dead in them, and they were judged, each one according to their works;
272014 and the death and the hades were cast to the lake of the fire -- this [is] the second death;
272015 and if any one was not found written in the scroll of the life, he was cast to the lake of the fire.
272101 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth did pass away, and the sea is not any more;
272102 and I, John, saw the holy city -- new Jerusalem -- coming down from God out of the heaven, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband;
272103 and I heard a great voice out of the heaven, saying, 'Lo, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them -- their God,
272104 and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and the death shall not be any more, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor shall there be any more pain, because the first things did go away.'
272105 And He who is sitting upon the throne said, 'Lo, new I make all things; and He saith to me, 'Write, because these words are true and stedfast;'
272106 and He said to me, 'It hath been done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End; I, to him who is thirsting, will give of the fountain of the water of the life freely;
272107 he who is overcoming shall inherit all things, and I will be to him -- a God, and he shall be to me -- the son,
272108 and to fearful, and unstedfast, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, their part [is] in the lake that is burning with fire and brimstone, which is a second death.'
272109 And there came unto me one of the seven messengers, who have the seven vials that are full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, 'Come, I will shew thee the bride of the Lamb -- the wife,'
272110 and he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and did shew to me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,
272111 having the glory of God, and her light [is] like a stone most precious, as a jasper stone clear as crystal,
272112 having also a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve messengers, and names written thereon, which are [those] of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel,
272113 at the east three gates, at the north three gates, at the south three gates, at the west three gates;
272114 and the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
272115 And he who is speaking with me had a golden reed, that he may measure the city, and its gates, and its wall;
272116 and the city lieth square, and the length of it is as great as the breadth; and he did measure the city with the reed -- furlongs twelve thousand; the length, and the breadth, and the height, of it are equal;
272117 and he measured its wall, an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of the messenger;
272118 and the building of its wall was jasper, and the city [is] pure gold -- like to pure glass;
272119 and the foundations of the wall of the city with every precious stone have been adorned; the first foundation jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
272120 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
272121 And the twelve gates [are] twelve pearls, each several one of the gates was of one pearl; and the broad-place of the city [is] pure gold -- as transparent glass.
272122 And a sanctuary I did not see in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, is its sanctuary, and the Lamb,
272123 and the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they may shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp of it [is] the Lamb;
272124 and the nations of the saved in its light shall walk, and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it,
272125 and its gates shall not at all be shut by day, for night shall not be there;
272126 and they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it;
272127 and there may not at all enter into it any thing defiling and doing abomination, and a lie, but -- those written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb.
272201 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb:
272202 in the midst of its broad place, and of the river on this side and on that, [is] a tree of life, yielding twelve fruits, in each several month rendering its fruits, and the leaves of the tree [are] for the service of the nations;
272203 and any curse there shall not be any more, and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him,
272204 and they shall see His face, and His name [is] upon their foreheads,
272205 and night shall not be there, and they have no need of a lamp and light of a sun, because the Lord God doth give them light, and they shall reign -- to the ages of the ages.
272206 And he said to me, 'These words [are] stedfast and true, and the Lord God of the holy prophets did send His messenger to shew to His servants the things that it behoveth to come quickly:
272207 Lo, I come quickly; happy [is] he who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this scroll.'
272208 And I, John, am he who is seeing these things and hearing, and when I heard and beheld, I fell down to bow before the feet of the messenger who is shewing me these things;
272209 and he saith to me, 'See -- not; for fellow-servant of thee am I, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of those keeping the words of this scroll; before God bow.'
272210 And he saith to me, 'Thou mayest not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is nigh;
272211 he who is unrighteous -- let him be unrighteous still, and he who is filthy -- let him be filthy still, and he who is righteous -- let him be declared righteous still, and he who is sanctified -- let him be sanctified still:
272212 And lo, I come quickly, and my reward [is] with me, to render to each as his work shall be;
272213 I am the Alpha and the Omega -- the Beginning and End -- the First and the Last.
272214 'Happy are those doing His commands that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of the life, and by the gates they may enter into the city;
272215 and without [are] the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the whoremongers, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one who is loving and is doing a lie.
272216 'I, Jesus did send my messenger to testify to you these things concerning the assemblies; I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star!
272217 And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and he who is hearing -- let him say, Come; and he who is thirsting -- let him come; and he who is willing -- let him take the water of life freely.
272218 'For I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this scroll, if any one may add unto these, God shall add to him the plagues that have been written in this scroll,
272219 and if any one may take away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the scroll of the life, and out of the holy city, and the things that have been written in this scroll;'
272220 he saith -- who is testifying these things -- 'Yes, I come quickly!' Amen! Yes, be coming, Lord Jesus!
272221 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you all. Amen.
