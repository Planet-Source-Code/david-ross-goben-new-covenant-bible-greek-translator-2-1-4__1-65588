010101 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
010102 Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.
010103 And Judah fathered Pharez and Zarah of Tamar. And Pharez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram,
010104 and Ram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.
010105 And Salmon fathered Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed of Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,
010106 and Jesse fathered David the king. And David the king fathered Solomon of her who had been wife of Uriah.
010107 And Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa.
010108 And Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Jehoram, and Jehoram fathered Uzziah.
010109 And Uzziah fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.
010110 And Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah.
010111 And Josiah fathered Jehoiachin and his brothers, at the time they were carried away to Babylon.
010112 And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jehoiachin fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.
010113 And Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.
010114 And Azor fathered Sadoc, and Sadoc fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud.
010115 And Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.
010116 And Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband to be of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.
010117 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations. And from David until the carrying away into Babylon, fourteen generations. And from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ, fourteen generations.
010118 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was this way (for His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph) before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
010119 But Joseph, her husband to be , being just, and not willing to make her a public example, he purposed to put her away secretly.
010120 And as he thought upon these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take to you Mary as your wife. For that in her is fathered of the Holy Spirit.
010121 And she shall bear a son, and you shall call His name JESUS: for He shall save His people from their sins.
010122 Now all this happened so that might be fulfilled that which was spoken of the LORD by the prophet, saying,
010123 "Behold, the virgin shall conceive in her womb, and will bear a son. And they will call His name Emmanuel," which being interpreted is, God with us.
010124 And Joseph, being roused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife,
010125 and did not know her until she bore her son, the First-born. And he called His name JESUS.
010201 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem,
010202 saying, Where is He who is born king of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east and have come to worship Him.
010203 But when Herod the king heard these things , he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
010204 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
010205 And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea. For so it is written by the prophet,
010206 "And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the governors of Judah. For out of you shall come a Governor who shall rule My people Israel."
010207 Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, inquired of them exactly what time the star appeared.
010208 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child. And when you have found him , bring me word again so that I may come and worship him also.
010209 When they had heard the king, they departed. And lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them until it came and stood over where the child was.
010210 And seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
010211 And coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary His mother. And they fell down and worshiped Him. And opening their treasures, they presented gifts to Him, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
010212 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
010213 And when they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and His mother and flee into Egypt. And be there until I bring you word, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy Him.
010214 And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt.
010215 And he was there until the death of Herod; so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the LORD through the prophet, "Out of Egypt I have called My Son."
010216 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was greatly enraged. And he sent and killed all the boys in Bethlehem, and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had carefully inquired of the wise men.
010217 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
010218 "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not ."
010219 But Herod having expired, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
010220 saying, Arise, and take the child and His mother. And go into the land of Israel. For the ones who sought the child's life are dead.
010221 And he arose and took the child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.
010222 But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea in his father Herod's place, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee.
010223 And he came and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
010301 In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
010302 and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
010303 For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight."
010304 And the same John had his clothing of camel's hair and a leather girdle about his loins. And his food was locusts and wild honey.
010305 Then Jerusalem and all Judea went out to him, and all the region round about Jordan.
010306 And they were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
010307 But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
010308 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance;
010309 and do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
010310 And now also, the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
010311 I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. But He who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire;
010312 whose fan is in His hand, and He will cleanse His floor and gather His wheat into the storehouse; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
010313 Then Jesus came from Galilee to Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.
010314 But John restrained Him, saying, I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?
010315 And answering Jesus said to him, Allow it now, for it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed Him.
010316 And Jesus, when He had been baptized, went up immediately out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon Him.
010317 And lo, a voice from Heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
010401 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wilderness, to be tempted by the Devil.
010402 And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He was afterwards hungry.
010403 And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If You are the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
010404 But He answered and said, It is written, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God."
010405 Then the Devil took Him up into the holy city and set Him upon a pinnacle of the Temple.
010406 And he said to Him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down. For it is written, "He shall give His angels charge concerning You, and in their hands they shall bear You up, lest at any time You dash Your foot against a stone."
010407 Jesus said to him, It is written again, "You shall not tempt the Lord your God."
010408 Again, the Devil took Him up into a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
010409 And he said to Him, All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.
010410 Then Jesus said to him, Go, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve."
010411 Then the Devil left him. And behold, angels came and ministered to Him.
010412 But when Jesus heard that John was thrown into prison, He went back into Galilee.
010413 And leaving Nazareth, He came and lived in Capernaum, which is on the seacoast, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,
010414 so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
010415 "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations!
010416 The people who sat in darkness saw a great Light; and Light has sprung up to those who sat in the region and shadow of death."
010417 From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent! For the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
010418 And walking by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea. For they were fishermen.
010419 And He said to them, Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.
010420 And they immediately left their nets and followed him.
010421 And going on from there, he saw another two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them;
010422 and they immediately left the boat and their father and followed Him.
010423 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people.
010424 And His fame went throughout all Syria. And they brought to Him all those being badly ill suffering various diseases and torments, and those who had been possessed with demons, and those who had been moonstruck, and paralytics. And He healed them.
010425 And great multitudes of people followed Him, from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond Jordan.
010501 And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain. And when He had sat down, His disciples came to Him.
010502 And He opened His mouth and taught them, saying,
010503 Blessed are the poor in spirit! For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.
010504 Blessed are they that mourn! For they shall be comforted.
010505 Blessed are the meek! For they shall inherit the earth.
010506 Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness! For they shall be filled.
010507 Blessed are the merciful! For they shall obtain mercy.
010508 Blessed are the pure in heart! For they shall see God.
010509 Blessed are the peacemakers! For they shall be called the sons of God.
010510 Blessed are they who have been persecuted for righteousness sake! For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.
010511 Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you , and shall say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for My sake.
010512 Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward in Heaven is great. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
010513 You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its savor, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything, but to be thrown out and to be trodden underfoot by men.
010514 You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
010515 Nor do men light a lamp and put it under the grain-measure, but on a lampstand. And it gives light to all who are in the house.
010516 Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in Heaven.
010517 Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.
010518 For truly I say to you, Till the heaven and the earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall in any way pass from the law until all is fulfilled.
010519 Therefore whoever shall break one of these commandments, the least, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of Heaven. But whoever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of Heaven.
010520 For I say to you that unless your righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven.
010521 You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "You shall not kill" --and, "Whoever shall kill shall be liable to the judgment."
010522 But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be liable to the judgment. And whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the sanhedrin; but whoever shall say, Fool! shall be liable to be thrown into the fire of hell.
010523 Therefore if you offer your gift on the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,
010524 leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
010525 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him; that the opponent not deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
010526 Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you have paid the last kodrantes.
010527 You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "You shall not commit adultery."
010528 But I say to you that whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
010529 And if your right eye offends you, pluck it out and throw it from you. For it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
010530 And if your right hand offends you, cut it off and throw it from you. For it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
010531 It was also said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.
010532 But I say to you that whoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever shall marry her who is put away commits adultery.
010533 Again, you have heard that it has been said to the ancients, "You shall not swear falsely, but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord."
010534 But I say to you, Do not swear at all! Not by Heaven, because it is God's throne;
010535 not by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; not by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King;
010536 nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.
010537 But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no. For whatever is more than these comes from evil.
010538 You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."
010539 But I say to you, Do not resist evil. But whoever shall strike you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.
010540 And to him desiring to sue you, and to take away your tunic, let him have your coat also.
010541 And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.
010542 Give to him who asks of you, and you shall not turn away from him who would borrow from you.
010543 You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
010544 But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who despitefully use you and persecute you,
010545 so that you may become sons of your Father in Heaven. For He makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
010546 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax-collectors do the same?
010547 And if you greet your brothers only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax-collectors do so?
010548 Therefore be perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.
010601 Take heed that you do not do your merciful deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward with your Father in Heaven.
010602 Therefore when you do your merciful deeds, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.
010603 But when you do merciful deeds, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does,
010604 so that your merciful deeds may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret Himself shall reward you openly.
010605 And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.
010606 But you, when you pray, enter into your room. And shutting your door, pray to your Father in secret; and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you openly.
010607 But when you pray, do not babble vain words, as the nations. For they think that in their much speaking they shall be heard.
010608 Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask Him.
010609 Therefore pray in this way: Our Father, who is in Heaven, Hallowed be Your name.
010610 Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.
010611 Give us this day our daily bread;
010612 and forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.
010613 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil. For Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
010614 For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;
010615 but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
010616 And when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, of a sad face. For they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.
010617 But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
010618 so that you do not appear to men to fast, but to your Father in secret. And your Father who sees in secret shall reward you openly.
010619 Do not lay up treasures on earth for yourselves, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal.
010620 But lay up treasures in Heaven for yourselves, where neither moth nor rust corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
010621 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
010622 The light of the body is the eye. Therefore if your eye is sound, your whole body shall be full of light.
010623 But if your eye is evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
010624 No one can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
010625 Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
010626 Behold the birds of the air; for they sow not, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them; are you not much better than they are?
010627 Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?
010628 And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, nor do they spin,
010629 but I say to you that even Solomon in his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
010630 Therefore if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much rather clothe you, little-faiths?
010631 Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?
010632 For the nations seek after all these things. For your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.
010633 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.
010634 Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow; for tomorrow shall be anxious for its own things. Sufficient to the day is the evil of it.
010701 Judge not, that you may not be judged.
010702 For with whatever judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with whatever measure you measure out, it shall be measured to you again.
010703 And why do you look on the splinter that is in your brother's eye, but do not consider the beam that is in your own eye?
010704 Or how will you say to your brother, Let me pull the splinter out of your eye; and, behold, a beam is in your own eye?
010705 Hypocrite! First cast the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to cast the splinter out of your brother's eye.
010706 Do not give that which is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and tear you.
010707 Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.
010708 For each one who asks receives; and he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, it shall be opened.
010709 Or what man is there of you, if his son asks a loaf, will he give him a stone?
010710 Or if he asks a fish, will he give him a snake?
010711 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him?
010712 Therefore all things, whatever you desire that men should do to you, do even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.
010713 Go in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there are who go in through it.
010714 Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.
010715 Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
010716 You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
010717 Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.
010718 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruits, nor can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
010719 Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
010720 Therefore by their fruits you shall know them.
010721 Not everyone who says to Me, Lord! Lord! shall enter the kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in Heaven.
010722 Many will say to Me in that day, Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in Your name, and through Your name throw out demons, and through Your name do many wonderful works?
010723 And then I will say to them I never knew you! Depart from Me, those working lawlessness!
010724 Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on a rock.
010725 And the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house. And it did not fall, for it was founded on a rock.
010726 And everyone who hears these sayings of Mine and does not do them shall be compared to a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
010727 And the rain came down, and the floods came, and the wind blew and beat on that house. And it fell, and great was its fall.
010728 And it happened, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His doctrine.
010729 For He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
010801 When He had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
010802 And behold, a leper came and worshiped him, saying, Lord, if You will, You can make me clean.
010803 And Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, I will; be clean! And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
010804 And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest. And offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
010805 And when Jesus had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, beseeching Him,
010806 and saying, Lord, my son lies at home paralyzed and grievously tormented.
010807 And Jesus says to him, I will come and heal him.
010808 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my boy will be healed.
010809 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go! And he goes; and to another, Come! And he comes; and to my servant, Do this! And he does it .
010810 When Jesus heard, He marvelled and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.
010811 And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of Heaven.
010812 But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
010813 And Jesus said to the centurion, Go. And as you have believed, so let it be to you. And his boy was healed in that hour.
010814 And when Jesus had come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's mother laid out and in a fever.
010815 And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them.
010816 And evening coming on, they brought to Him many who had been possessed with demons. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick
010817 so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "He took on Himself our weaknesses and bore our sicknesses."
010818 And seeing great crowds, Jesus gave orders to depart to the other side.
010819 And a certain scribe came and said to him, Master, I will follow You wherever You go.
010820 And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay His head.
010821 And another of His disciples said to him, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.
010822 But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their dead.
010823 And He entering into a boat, His disciples followed Him.
010824 And behold, a great tempest arose in the sea, so much so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep.
010825 And His disciples came to Him and awakened Him, saying, Lord, save us! We perish!
010826 And He said to them, Why are you afraid, little-faiths? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
010827 But the men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
010828 And when He had come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, two demon-possessed ones met Him, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one might pass by that way.
010829 And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?
010830 And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine, feeding.
010831 And the demons begged Him, saying, If You cast us out, allow us to go away into the herd of swine.
010832 And He said to them, Go! And when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters.
010833 And those who fed them fled. And going into the city, they told everything, and what had happened to the ones who had been possessed of demons.
010834 And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged that He would depart out of their borders.
010901 And He entered into a boat, and passed over, and came to His own city.
010902 And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Child, be of good cheer. Your sins are forgiven you.
010903 And lo, some of the scribes said within themselves, This one blasphemes.
010904 And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?
010905 For which is easier? To say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Arise and walk!
010906 But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins, then He said to the paralytic, Arise, take up your bed and go to your house.
010907 And he arose and departed to his house.
010908 But when the crowds saw, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
010909 And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax-office. And He said to him, Follow Me! And he arose and followed Him.
010910 And it happened as Jesus reclined in the house, behold, many tax-collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Him and His disciples.
010911 And when the Pharisees saw, they said to His disciples, Why does your master eat with tax-collectors and sinners?
010912 But when Jesus heard, He said to them, The ones who are whole do not need a physician, but the ones who are sick.
010913 But go and learn what this is , I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
010914 Then the disciples of John came to Him saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?
010915 And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast.
010916 No one puts a piece of new cloth onto an old garment; for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the tear is made worse.
010917 Nor do men put new wine into old wineskins; else the wineskins burst, and the wine runs out, and the wineskins perish. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.
010918 While He spoke these things to them, behold, a certain ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, My daughter has just now died. But come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.
010919 And Jesus arose and followed him. And so did His disciples.
010920 And behold, a woman, who had a flow of blood for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the hem of His garment.
010921 For she said within herself, If only I shall touch His robe, I will be whole.
010922 But turning and seeing her, Jesus said, Daughter, be comforted; your faith has saved you. And the woman was saved from that hour.
010923 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
010924 He said to them, Go back, for the little girl is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed Him to scorn.
010925 But when the people were put out, He went in and took her by the hand, and the little girl arose.
010926 And this report went out into all that land.
010927 And when Jesus passed on from there, two blind ones followed Him, crying and saying, Son of David, have mercy on us.
010928 And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.
010929 Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith let it be to you.
010930 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See, let no one know.
010931 But going out, they made Him known in all that land.
010932 As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a dumb man, who had been demon-possessed.
010933 And when the demon had been cast out, the dumb one spoke. And multitudes marveled, saying, Never was it seen like this in Israel!
010934 But the Pharisees said, He throws out demons by the ruler of the demons.
010935 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
010936 But seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion on them, because they were tired and scattered like sheep having no shepherd.
010937 Then He said to His disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.
010938 Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest that He will send out laborers into His harvest.
011001 And when He had called to Him His twelve disciples, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease.
011002 And the names of the twelve apostles are these: First, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee and John his brother;
011003 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-collector; James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname was Thaddeus;
011004 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
011005 Jesus sent out these twelve, commanding them, saying, Do not go into the way of the nations, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.
011006 But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
011007 And as you go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
011008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. You have received freely, freely give.
011009 Do not provide gold nor silver, nor copper in your purses,
011010 nor a bag for the journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor staves. For the workman is worthy of his food.
011011 And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who within it is worthy. And there abide until you go away from there.
011012 And when you come into a house, greet it.
011013 And if the house is worthy, let your peace come on it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
011014 And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
011015 Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
011016 Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves.
011017 But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the sanhedrins, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.
011018 And you shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them and the nations.
011019 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak; for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak.
011020 For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
011021 And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. And the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.
011022 And you will be hated of all men for My name's sake, but the one who endures to the end shall be kept safe.
011023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee into another; for truly I say to you, In no way shall you have finished the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
011024 A disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.
011025 It is enough for the disciple that he is like his master, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household?
011026 Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and nothing hidden which shall not be known.
011027 What I tell you in darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear, proclaim on the housetops.
011028 And do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
011029 Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
011030 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
011031 Therefore do not fear, you are of more value than many sparrows.
011032 Then everyone who shall confess Me before men, I will confess him before My Father who is in Heaven.
011033 But whoever shall deny Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in Heaven.
011034 Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did not come to send peace, but a sword.
011035 For I have come to set a man against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
011036 And a man's foes shall be those of his own household.
011037 He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
011038 And he who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.
011039 He who finds his life shall lose it. And he who loses his life for My sake shall find it.
011040 He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
011041 He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. And he who receives a just one in the name of a just one will receive a just one's reward.
011042 And whoever shall give to one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink, only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, He shall in no way lose his reward.
011101 And it happened, when Jesus had finished commanding His twelve disciples, He left there to teach and to proclaim in their cities.
011102 But when John heard in the prison of the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples.
011103 And they said to Him, Are You he who should come, or do we look for another?
011104 Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John again those things which you hear and see:
011105 the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel proclaimed to them.
011106 And blessed is he , whoever shall not be offended in Me.
011107 And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
011108 But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing ? Behold, they who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
011109 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and one more excellent than a prophet.
011110 For this is the one of whom it is written, "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You."
011111 Truly I say to you, Among those who have been born of women there has not risen a greater one than John the Baptist. But the least in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
011112 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of Heaven is taken by violence, and the violent take it by force.
011113 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
011114 And if you will receive it , this is Elijah who is to come.
011115 He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
011116 But to what shall I compare to this generation? It is like little children sitting in the markets and calling to their playmates,
011117 saying, We played the flute to you, and you did not dance! We mourned to you, but you did not wail!
011118 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.
011119 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man who is a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners. But wisdom was justified by her children.
011120 Then He began to upbraid the cities in which most of His mighty works were done, because they did not repent.
011121 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the powerful acts which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes!
011122 But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
011123 And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to the heaven, shall be brought down to hell. For if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
011124 But I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.
011125 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank You, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the sophisticated and cunning, and revealed them to babes.
011126 Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.
011127 All things are delivered to Me by My Father. And no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son will reveal Him.
011128 Come to Me all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
011129 Take My yoke on you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest to your souls.
011130 For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.
011201 At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on the sabbath day. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the heads of grain and to eat.
011202 But when the Pharisees saw, they said to Him, Behold, your disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day.
011203 But He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him,
011204 how he entered into the house of God and ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
011205 Or have you not read in the Law that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless?
011206 But I say to you that One greater than the temple is in this place.
011207 But if you had known what this is, "I desire mercy and not sacrifice," you would not have condemned those who are not guilty.
011208 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.
011209 And when He had departed from there, He went into their synagogue.
011210 And behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbaths? This so that they might accuse Him.
011211 And He said to them, What man among you will be, who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the sabbaths, will he not lay hold on it and lift it out?
011212 How much better is a man then than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
011213 Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and it was restored whole like the other.
011214 Then the Pharisees went out and held council against Him, as to how they might destroy Him.
011215 But when Jesus knew it , He withdrew Himself from there. And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them all.
011216 And He warned them that they not make Him known,
011217 so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
011218 "Behold My Child whom I have chosen; My Beloved, in whom My soul is well pleased. I will put My Spirit on Him, and He shall declare judgment to the nations.
011219 He shall not strive, nor cry, nor shall any one hear His voice in the streets.
011220 He will not break a bruised reed, and He will not quench a smoking wick, until He sends out judgment to victory.
011221 And in His name the nations shall trust."
011222 Then one who had been demon-possessed was brought to Him, blind and dumb. And He healed him, so much so that the blind and dumb one both spoke and saw.
011223 And all the people were amazed and said, Is not this the son of David?
011224 But when the Pharisees heard, they said, This one does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub the ruler of the demons.
011225 And Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.
011226 And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
011227 But if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
011228 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
011229 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods, unless first he binds the strong one, and then he will plunder his house.
011230 The one who is not with Me is against Me, and the one who does not gather with Me scatters.
011231 Therefore I say to you, All kinds of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.
011232 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this world or in the world to come.
011233 Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.
011234 Offspring of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
011235 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart brings out good things; and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings out evil things.
011236 But I say to you that every idle word, whatever men may speak, they shall give account of it in the day of judgment.
011237 For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.
011238 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we want to see a sign from you.
011239 But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign. And there shall be no sign given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
011240 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the huge fish, so the Son of man shall be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
011241 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, because they repented at the proclaiming of Jonah, and behold, One greater than Jonah is here.
011242 The queen of the south shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, One greater than Solomon is here.
011243 When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he walks through dry places seeking rest, and finds none.
011244 Then he said, I will return into my house from where I came out. And when he has come, he finds it empty, swept, and decorated.
011245 Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and live there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so it also shall be to this evil generation.
011246 But while He yet talked with the people, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside, desiring to speak with Him.
011247 Then one said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers stand outside, desiring to speak with You.
011248 And He answered and said to him who told Him, Who is My mother? And who are My brothers?
011249 And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said, Behold, My mother and My brothers!
011250 For whoever shall do the will of My Father in Heaven, the same is My brother and sister and mother.
011301 In that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside.
011302 And great crowds were gathered to Him, so that He went into a boat and sat. And all the crowd stood on the shore.
011303 And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow.
011304 And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them.
011305 Some fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth. And they sprang up immediately, because they had no deepness of earth.
011306 And the sun rising, they were scorched, and because they had no root, they withered away.
011307 And some fell among thorns. And the thorns sprung up and choked them.
011308 And some fell on the good ground and yielded fruit, indeed one a hundredfold, and one sixty, and one thirty.
011309 He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
011310 And the disciples said to Him, Why do You speak to them in parables?
011311 He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.
011312 For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance. But whoever does not have, from him shall be taken away even that which he has.
011313 Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not; nor do they understand.
011314 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which said, "By hearing you shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive;
011315 for this people's heart has become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes, lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
011316 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
011317 For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear what you hear, and have not heard them.
011318 Therefore hear the parable of the sower.
011319 When anyone hears the Word of the kingdom and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown by the wayside.
011320 But that which was sown on the stony places is this: he who hears the Word and immediately receives it with joy.
011321 But he has no root in himself, and is temporary. For when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, he immediately stumbles.
011322 And that sown into the thorns is this: he who hears the Word; and the anxiety of this world, and the deceit of riches, choke the Word, and he becomes unfruitful.
011323 But that sown on the good ground is this: he who hears the Word and understands; who also bears fruit and produces one truly a hundredfold; and one sixty; and one thirty.
011324 He put out another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.
011325 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel among the wheat and went his way.
011326 But when the blade had sprung up and had produced fruit, then the darnel also appeared.
011327 So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then where have the darnel come from?
011328 He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and gather them up?
011329 But he said, No, lest while you gather up the darnel you also root up the wheat with them.
011330 Let both grow together until the harvest. And in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather together the darnel and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my granary.
011331 He put out another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;
011332 which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.
011333 He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.
011334 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable,
011335 so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world."
011336 Then sending the crowds away, Jesus went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field.
011337 He answered and said to them, He who sows the good seed is the Son of man;
011338 the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; but the darnel are the sons of the evil one .
011339 The enemy who sowed them is the Devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
011340 Therefore as the darnel are gathered and burned in the fire, so it shall be in the end of this world.
011341 The Son of man shall send out His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who do iniquity,
011342 and shall cast them into a furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
011343 Then the righteous shall shine out like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
011344 Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which when a man has found it, he hides it, and for the joy of it goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
011345 Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls;
011346 who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
011347 Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered some of every kind;
011348 which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.
011349 So it shall be at the end of the world. The angels shall come out and separate the wicked from among the just,
011350 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
011351 Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.
011352 Then He said to them, Therefore every scribe who is instructed to the kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out things new and old out of his treasure.
011353 And it happened when Jesus finished these parables, He departed from there.
011354 And when He had come into His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so much so that they were astonished and said, From where does this man have this wisdom and these mighty works?
011355 Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas,
011356 and his sisters, are they not all with us? Then from where does this man have all these things?
011357 And they were offended in Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house.
011358 And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
011401 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus
011402 and said to his servants, This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead, and therefore the powerful works are working in him.
011403 For Herod had laid hold on John, and had bound him, and had put him in prison because of Herodias his brother Philip's wife.
011404 For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.
011405 And when he desired to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
011406 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.
011407 So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.
011408 And she, being instructed before by her mother, said, Give me John the Baptist's head here on a platter.
011409 And the king was sorry. But for the oath's sake, and those reclining with him , he commanded it to be given.
011410 And he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
011411 And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl. And she brought it to her mother.
011412 And his disciples came and took up the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
011413 When Jesus heard, He departed from there by boat into a deserted place apart. And hearing, the crowds followed Him on foot out of the cities.
011414 And Jesus went out and saw a great crowd, and He was moved with compassion toward them. And He healed their sick.
011415 And evening coming on, His disciples came to Him, saying, The place is deserted and the time has already gone by. Send the crowd away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.
011416 But Jesus said to them, They do not need to leave, you give them something to eat.
011417 And they said to Him, We have here only five loaves and two fish.
011418 And He said, Bring them here to Me.
011419 And He commanded the crowd to recline on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to Heaven He blessed and broke, and gave the loaves to His disciples. And the disciples gave to the crowd.
011420 And they all ate and were filled. And they took up twelve hand baskets full from the fragments that remained.
011421 And they who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
011422 And immediately Jesus constrained His disciples to get into a boat and to go before Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.
011423 And when He had sent the crowds away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray. And when evening had come, He was there alone.
011424 But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves; for the wind was against them.
011425 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
011426 And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a phantom! And they cried out for fear.
011427 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer, I AM! Do not fear.
011428 And Peter answered Him and said, LORD, if it is You, tell me to come to You on the water.
011429 And He said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus.
011430 But seeing that the wind was strong, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me!
011431 And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him; and said to him, Little-faith! Why did you doubt?
011432 And when they had come into the boat, the wind ceased.
011433 And those in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God.
011434 And when they had passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
011435 And recognizing Him, the men of that place sent to all that neighborhood, and brought to Him all who were diseased.
011436 And they begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His robe. And as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
011501 Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,
011502 Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
011503 But He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
011504 For God commanded, saying, "Honor your father and mother"; and, "He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him die by death."
011505 But you say, Whoever says to his father or mother, Whatever you would gain from me, It is a gift to God;
011506 and in no way he honors his father or his mother. And you voided the commandment of God by your tradition.
011507 Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
011508 "This people draws near to Me with their mouth, and honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
011509 But in vain they worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."
011510 And He called the crowd and said to them, Hear and understand.
011511 Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.
011512 Then His disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?
011513 But He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.
011514 Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
011515 Then Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.
011516 And Jesus said, Are you also still without understanding?
011517 Do you not yet understand that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into the waste-bowl?
011518 But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile the man.
011519 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies;
011520 these are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.
011521 And going out from there, Jesus withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
011522 And behold, a woman of Canaan coming out of these borders cried to Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.
011523 But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and begged Him, saying, Send her away, for she cries after us.
011524 But He answered and said, I am not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
011525 Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, Lord, help me!
011526 But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children's bread and to throw it to dogs.
011527 And she said, True, O Lord; but even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' tables.
011528 Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! So be it to you even as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
011529 And moving from there Jesus came beside the Sea of Galilee. And He went up into a mountain and sat there.
011530 And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others. And they cast them down at Jesus' feet. And He healed them,
011531 so much so that the crowd wondered when they saw the dumb speak, the maimed sound, the lame walk, and the blind see. And they glorified the God of Israel.
011532 Then Jesus called His disciples and said, I have compassion on the crowd because they continue with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat. And I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
011533 And His disciples said to Him, From where should we get so many loaves in the wilderness, so as to fill so great a crowd?
011534 And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few little fish.
011535 And He commanded the crowd to sit on the ground.
011536 And He took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to His disciples. And the disciples gave to the crowd.
011537 And they all ate, and were filled; and they took up seven lunch baskets full of the pieces that was left.
011538 And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
011539 And sending the crowd away, He went into the boat and came into the borders of Magdala.
011601 The Pharisees and the Sadducees came to Him, tempting Him. And they asked Him that He would show them a sign from Heaven.
011602 He answered and said to them, When it is evening, you say, Fair weather; for the sky is red.
011603 And in the morning, Foul weather today; for the sky is red and gloomy. Hypocrites! You can discern the face of the sky, but you cannot see the signs of the times!
011604 A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign. And there shall no sign be given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah. And He left them and went away.
011605 And when His disciples had come to the other side, they forgot to take loaves.
011606 And Jesus said to them, Take heed, and beware the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
011607 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no loaves.
011608 And knowing Jesus said to them, Why do you reason among yourselves because you took no loaves, little-faiths?
011609 Do you not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many hand baskets you took up;
011610 nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many lunch baskets you took up?
011611 How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about loaves, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
011612 Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
011613 And coming into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say Me to be, the Son of man?
011614 And they said, Some say , John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
011615 He said to them, But who do you say I am?
011616 And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
011617 Jesus answered and said to him, You are blessed, Simon, son of Jonah, for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in Heaven.
011618 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
011619 And I will give the keys of the kingdom of Heaven to you. And whatever you may bind on earth shall occur, having been bound in Heaven, and whatever you may loose on earth shall occur, having been loosed in Heaven.
011620 Then He warned His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.
011621 From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
011622 Then Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be gracious to You, Lord! This shall never be to You.
011623 But He turned and said to Peter, Go, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you do not savor the things that are of God, but those that are of men.
011624 Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.
011625 For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whoever desires to lose his life for My sake shall find it.
011626 For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
011627 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He shall reward each one according to his works.
011628 Truly I say to you, There are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the Son of man coming in His kingdom.
011701 And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain apart.
011702 And He was transfigured before them. And His face shone as the sun, and His clothing was white as the light.
011703 And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with Him.
011704 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You will, let us make here three tabernacles; one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
011705 While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold a voice out of the cloud which said, This is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, hear Him.
011706 And when the disciples heard, they fell on their face and were greatly terrified.
011707 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise and do not be terrified.
011708 And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus alone.
011709 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man has risen from the dead.
011710 And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
011711 And answering Jesus said to them, Elijah truly shall come first and restore all things.
011712 But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him, but have done to him whatever they desired. Likewise also the Son of man shall suffer from them.
011713 Then His disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist.
011714 And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying,
011715 Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and grievously vexed; for oftentimes he falls into the fire, and often into the water.
011716 And I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him.
011717 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him here to Me.
011718 And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he departed out of him. And the child was cured from that very hour.
011719 Then the disciples came to Jesus apart, and said, Why could we not cast him out?
011720 And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief. For truly I say to you, If you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Move from here to there. And it shall move. And nothing shall be impossible to you.
011721 However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
011722 And while they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men.
011723 And they will kill Him, and the third day He will be raised again. And they grieved exceedingly.
011724 And when they had come to Capernaum, those who received the didrachmas came to Peter and said, Does your master not pay the didrachmas?
011725 He said, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? From their sons, or from strangers?
011726 Peter said to Him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then truly the sons are free.
011727 But lest we should offend them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. And when you have opened its mouth, you shall find a stater; take that, and give it to them for Me and you.
011801 At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is the greater in the kingdom of Heaven?
011802 And Jesus called a little child to Him and set him in their midst,
011803 and said, Truly I say to you, Unless you are converted and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven.
011804 Therefore whoever shall humble himself like this little child, this one is the greater in the kingdom of Heaven.
011805 And whoever shall receive one such little child in My name receives Me.
011806 But whoever shall offend one of these little ones who believes in Me, it would be better for him that an ass's millstone were hung around his neck, and he be sunk in the depth of the sea.
011807 Woe to the world because of offenses! For it is necessary that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!
011808 And if your hand or your foot causes you to offend, cut them off and throw them from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
011809 And if your eye offends you, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.
011810 Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones . For I say to you that in Heaven their angels always behold the face of My Father in Heaven.
011811 For the Son of man has come to save that which was lost.
011812 What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them strays, does he not leave the ninety and nine and go into the mountains and seek the straying one?
011813 And if it happens that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety and nine which did not stray.
011814 Even so it is not the will of your Father in Heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
011815 But if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.
011816 But if he will not hear you , take one or two more with you, so that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
011817 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he neglects to hear the church, let him be to you as a heathen and a tax-collector.
011818 Truly I say to you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall occur, having been bound in Heaven; and whatever you shall loose on earth shall occur, having been loosed in Heaven.
011819 Again I say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth as regarding anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by My Father in Heaven.
011820 For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.
011821 Then Peter came to Him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Until seven times?
011822 Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.
011823 Therefore the kingdom of Heaven has been compared to a certain king who desired to make an accounting with his servants.
011824 And when he had begun to count, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
011825 But as he had nothing to pay, his lord commanded that he, and his wife and children, and all that he had, be sold, and payment be made.
011826 Then the servant fell down and worshiped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me and I will pay you all.
011827 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the debt.
011828 But the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.
011829 And his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, Have patience with me and I will pay you all.
011830 And he would not, but went and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt.
011831 So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry. And they came and told their lord all that was done.
011832 Then his lord, after he had called him, said to him, O wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
011833 Should you not also have pitied your fellow servant, even as I had pity on you?
011834 And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was due to him.
011835 So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also to you, unless each one of you from your hearts forgive his brother their trespasses.
011901 And it happened, when Jesus had finished these sayings, that He departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond Jordan.
011902 And great crowds followed Him. And He healed them there.
011903 And the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him and saying to Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
011904 And He answered and said to them, Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning "made them male and female",
011905 and said, For this cause a man shall leave father and mother and shall cling to his wife, and the two of them shall be one flesh?
011906 Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.
011907 They said to Him, Why did Moses then command to give a bill of divorce and to put her away?
011908 He said to them, Because of your hard-heartedness Moses allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.
011909 And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is put away commits adultery.
011910 His disciples said to Him, If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not good to marry.
011911 But He said to them, Not all receive this word, except those to whom it is given.
011912 For there are some eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven's sake. He who is able to receive it , let him receive it.
011913 Then little children were brought to Him, that He should put His hands on them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them.
011914 But Jesus said, Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.
011915 And He laid His hands on them, and departed from there.
011916 And behold, one came and said to Him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?
011917 And He said to him, Why do you call Me good? There is none good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.
011918 He said to Him, Which? Jesus said, You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,
011919 honor your father and mother, and, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
011920 The young man said to Him, I have kept all these things from my youth up; what do I lack yet?
011921 Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come, follow Me.
011922 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.
011923 Then Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you that a rich man will with great difficulty enter into the kingdom of Heaven.
011924 And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
011925 When His disciples heard, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
011926 But Jesus looked on them and said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
011927 Then answering Peter said to Him, Behold, we have forsaken all and have followed You. Therefore what shall we have?
011928 And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
011929 And everyone who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
011930 But many who are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
012001 For the kingdom of Heaven is like a man, a housemaster, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.
012002 And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
012003 And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
012004 And he said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went.
012005 And he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise.
012006 And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why do you stand here all day idle?
012007 They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and you shall receive whatever is right.
012008 So when evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and pay them their wage, beginning from the last to the first.
012009 And when they who were hired about the eleventh hour came, they each one received a denarius.
012010 But when the first came, they supposed that they would received more; and they also each one received a denarius.
012011 And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,
012012 saying, These last have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and heat of the day.
012013 But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
012014 Take yours, and go; I will give to this last one the same as to you.
012015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with my own? Is your eye evil because I am good?
012016 So the last shall be first, and the first last, for many are called, but few are chosen.
012017 And going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,
012018 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem. And the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death.
012019 And they shall deliver Him to the nations to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He shall rise again.
012020 Then the mother of Zebedee's children came to Him with her sons, worshiping and desiring a certain thing from Him.
012021 And He said to her, What do you desire? She said to Him, Grant that these my two sons may sit in Your kingdom, the one on Your right hand and the other on the left.
012022 But Jesus answered and said, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They said to Him, We are able.
012023 And He said to them, You shall indeed drink of My cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but to those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.
012024 And when the ten heard it , they were indignant concerning the two brothers.
012025 But Jesus called them and said, You know that the rulers of the nations exercise dominion over them, and they who are great exercise authority over them.
012026 However, it shall not be so among you. But whoever desires to be great among you, let him be your servant.
012027 And whoever desires to be chief among you, let him be your servant;
012028 even as the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.
012029 And as they departed from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.
012030 And behold, two blind men were sitting by the wayside. When they heard that Jesus passed by, they cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!
012031 And the crowd rebuked them, saying that they should be silent. But they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!
012032 And Jesus stood still and called them, and said, What do you desire that I should do to you?
012033 They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
012034 So Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.
012101 And when they drew near Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
012102 saying to them, Go into the village across from you. And immediately you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to Me.
012103 And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them, and immediately He will send them.
012104 All this was done so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
012105 "Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King comes to you, meek, and sitting on an ass, even a colt the foal of an ass."
012106 And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
012107 And they brought the ass, even the colt, and put their clothes on them, and He sat on them.
012108 And a very great crowd spread their garments in the way. Others cut down branches from the trees and spread them in the way.
012109 And the crowds who went before, and those who followed, cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
012110 And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
012111 And the crowd said, This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.
012112 And Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves.
012113 And He said to them, It is written, "My house shall be called the house of prayer"; but you have made it a den of thieves.
012114 And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
012115 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things which He did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were angry.
012116 And they said to Him, Do you hear what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes, have you never read, "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings You have perfected praise?"
012117 And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.
012118 And returning early to the city, He hungered.
012119 And seeing a fig tree in the way, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And He said to it, let no fruit grow on you forever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.
012120 And when the disciples saw, they marveled, saying, How quickly the fig tree has withered away!
012121 Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith and do not doubt, you shall not only do this miracle of the fig tree, but also; if you shall say to this mountain, Be moved and be thrown into the sea; it shall be done.
012122 And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.
012123 And when He had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority?
012124 And Jesus answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing; which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
012125 The baptism of John, where was it from? From Heaven or from men? And they reasoned within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
012126 But if we shall say From men, we fear the people; for all consider John as a prophet.
012127 And they answered Jesus and said, We cannot tell. And He said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
012128 But what do you think? A man had two sons; and he came to the first and said, Son, go work in my vineyard today.
012129 He answered and said, I will not. But afterwards he repented and went.
012130 And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go , sir; and did not go.
012131 Which of the two did the will of his father? They said to Him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that the tax-collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
012132 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax-collectors and the harlots believed him. And when you had seen it , you did not repent afterwards so that you might believe him.
012133 Hear another parable. There was a certain housemaster who planted a vineyard and hedged it round about, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and rented it to vinedressers, and went into a far country.
012134 And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers to receive its fruits.
012135 And the vinedressers took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
012136 Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did the same to them.
012137 But last of all he sent his son to them, saying, They will respect my son.
012138 But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and get hold of his inheritance.
012139 And taking him, they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
012140 Therefore when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?
012141 They said to Him, Bad men! He will miserably destroy them and will rent out his vineyard to other vinedressers who will give him the fruits in their seasons.
012142 Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the Scriptures, "The stone which the builders rejected, this One has become the head of the corner; this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?"
012143 Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing out its fruits.
012144 And he who falls on this Stone shall be broken, but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
012145 And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they knew that He spoke of them.
012146 But seeking to lay hands on Him, they feared the crowd, because they held Him for a prophet.
012201 And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,
012202 The kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who made a marriage for his son.
012203 And he sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they would not come.
012204 Again he sent out other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage.
012205 But not caring, they went their ways, one to his field, another to his trading.
012206 And the rest took his servants and treated them spitefully, and killed them .
012207 But when the king heard, he was angry. And he sent out his armies and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
012208 Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they who were invited were not worthy.
012209 Therefore go into the exits of the highways, and as many as you shall find, invite them to the marriage.
012210 So the servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. And the wedding was filled with reclining guests.
012211 And the king coming in to look over the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.
012212 And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
012213 Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
012214 For many are called, but few chosen.
012215 Then the Pharisees left and took counsel that they might entangle Him in words.
012216 And they sent their disciples out to Him along with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and that you teach the way of God in truth. Nor do you care for anyone, for you do not regard the person of men.
012217 Therefore tell us; what do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?
012218 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why do you tempt Me, hypocrites?
012219 Show Me the tribute money. And they brought a denarius to Him.
012220 And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this?
012221 They said to Him, Caesar's. Then He said to them, Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.
012222 When they heard these words , they marveled, and they left Him and went away.
012223 On that day the Sadducees came to Him, who say that there is no resurrection. And they asked Him,
012224 saying, Master, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.
012225 Now there were with us seven brothers. And the first, when he had married a wife, died. And, having no issue, he left his wife to his brother.
012226 The second also did likewise, and the third, to the seventh.
012227 And last of all the woman also died.
012228 Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be, of the seven? For they all had her.
012229 Jesus answered and said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.
012230 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in Heaven.
012231 But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
012232 "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?" God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
012233 And when the crowd heard this , they were astonished at His doctrine.
012234 But hearing that He had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees were gathered together.
012235 Then one of them, a lawyer, asked, tempting Him and saying,
012236 Master, which is the great commandment in the Law?
012237 Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
012238 This is the first and great commandment.
012239 And the second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
012240 On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.
012241 While the Pharisees were gathered, Jesus asked them,
012242 saying, What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he? They say to Him, David's.
012243 He said to them, How then does David by the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
012244 "the LORD said to my Lord, Sit on My right until I make Your enemies Your footstool for Your feet?"
012245 If David then calls Him Lord, how is He his son?
012246 And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to question Him any more.
012301 Then Jesus spoke to the crowd and to His disciples,
012302 saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
012303 Therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do. But do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do.
012304 For they bind heavy and hard-to-carry burdens and lay them on men's shoulders. But they will not move them with one of their finger.
012305 But they do all their works in order to be seen of men. They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments.
012306 And they love the first couch at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
012307 and greetings in the market-places, and to be called, Rabbi! Rabbi! by men.
012308 But you must not be called Rabbi, for One is your teacher, Christ, and you are all brothers.
012309 And call no one your father on the earth, for One is your Father in Heaven.
012310 Nor be called teachers, for One is your Teacher, even Christ.
012311 But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant.
012312 And whoever shall exalt himself shall be abased, and he who shall humble himself shall be exalted.
012313 But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of Heaven against men. For you neither go in, nor do you allow those entering to go in.
012314 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and pray at length as a pretense. Therefore you shall receive the greater condemnation.
012315 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you compass sea and the dry land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
012316 Woe to you, blind guides, saying, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
012317 Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
012318 And, Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is a debtor!
012319 Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
012320 Therefore whoever shall swear by the altar swears by it, and by all things on it.
012321 And whoever shall swear by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
012322 And he who shall swear by Heaven swears by the throne of God, and by Him who sits on it.
012323 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithes of mint and dill and cummin, and you have left undone the weightier matters of the Law, judgment, mercy, and faith. You ought to have done these and not to leave the other undone.
012324 Blind guides who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!
012325 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of extortion and excess.
012326 Blind Pharisee! First cleanse the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of them may be clean also.
012327 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outside, but inside they are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
012328 Even so you also appear righteous to men outwardly, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
012329 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the righteous,
012330 and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
012331 Therefore you are witnesses to yourselves, that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets;
012332 and you fill up the measure of your fathers.
012333 Serpents! Offspring of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?
012334 Therefore, behold, I send prophets and wise men and scribes to you. And you will kill and crucify some of them. And some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city;
012335 so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berachiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.
012336 Truly I say to you, All these things shall come on this generation.
012337 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to her, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!
012338 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
012339 For I say to you, You shall not see Me from now on until you say, "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord."
012401 And Jesus went out and departed from the temple. And His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.
012402 And Jesus said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone on another that shall not be thrown down.
012403 And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the world?
012404 And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
012405 For many will come in My name, saying, I am Christ, and will deceive many.
012406 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for all these things must occur; but the end is not yet.
012407 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in different places.
012408 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
012409 Then they will deliver you up to be afflicted and will kill you. And you will be hated of all nations for My name's sake.
012410 And then many will be offended, and will betray one another, and will hate one another.
012411 And many false prophets will rise and deceive many.
012412 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many will become cold.
012413 But he who endures to the end, the same shall be kept safe.
012414 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be proclaimed in all the world as a witness to all nations. And then the end shall come.
012415 Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoever reads, let him understand).
012416 Then let those in Judea flee into the mountains.
012417 Let him on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house;
012418 nor let him in the field turn back to take his clothes.
012419 And woe to those who are with child, and to those who give suck in those days!
012420 But pray that your flight is not in the winter, nor on the sabbath day;
012421 for then shall be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world to this time; no, nor ever shall be.
012422 And unless those days should be shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the elect's sake, those days shall be shortened.
012423 Then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ! Or, There! Do not believe it.
012424 For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders; so much so that, if it were possible, they would deceive even the elect.
012425 Behold, I have told you beforehand.
012426 Therefore if they shall say to you, Behold, He is in the desert! Do not go out. Behold, He is in the secret rooms! Do not believe it.
012427 For as the lightning comes out of the east and shines even to the west, so also will be the coming of the Son of man.
012428 For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered.
012429 And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
012430 And then the sign of the Son of man shall appear in the heavens. And then all the tribes of the earth shall mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of the heaven with power and great glory.
012431 And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
012432 Now learn a parable of the fig tree. When its branch is still tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.
012433 So you, likewise, when you see all these things, shall know that it is near, at the doors.
012434 Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass until all these things are fulfilled.
012435 The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.
012436 But of that day and hour no one knows, no, not the angels of Heaven, but only My Father.
012437 But as the days of Noah were , so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
012438 For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the ark.
012439 And they did not know until the flood came and took them all away. So also will be the coming of the Son of man.
012440 Then two shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
012441 Two shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
012442 Therefore watch; for you do not know what hour your Lord comes.
012443 But know this, that if the steward of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be dug through.
012444 Therefore you also be ready, for in that hour you think not, the Son of man comes.
012445 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord has made ruler over His household, to give them food in due season?
012446 Blessed is that servant whom his Lord shall find him doing so when He comes.
012447 Truly I say to you that He shall make him ruler over all His goods.
012448 But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delays His coming,
012449 and shall begin to strike his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken,
012450 the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he does not look for Him , and in an hour which he does not know.
012451 And He shall cut him apart and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
012501 Then shall the kingdom of Heaven be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
012502 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
012503 The foolish ones took their lamps, but took no oil with them.
012504 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
012505 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
012506 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom comes! Go out to meet him.
012507 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
012508 And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps have gone out.
012509 But the wise answered, saying, No , lest there be not enough for us and you. But rather go to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.
012510 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. And they who were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.
012511 Afterwards the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
012512 But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.
012513 Therefore watch, for you do not know either the day or the hour in which the Son of man comes.
012514 For it is as if a man going abroad called his own servants and gave them his goods.
012515 And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to each according to his ability. And he went abroad at once.
012516 And going he who had received the five talents traded with them, and made another five talents.
012517 And likewise he who had received two, he also gained another two.
012518 But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the earth and hid his lord's silver.
012519 After a long time the lord of those servants came and took account with them.
012520 And so he who had received five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered five talents to me. Behold, I have gained five talents above them.
012521 His lord said to him, Well done , good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things; I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.
012522 He also who had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered two talents to me. Behold, I have gained two other talents above them.
012523 His lord said to him, Well done , good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.
012524 And he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew that you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
012525 And I was afraid and went and hid your talent in the earth. Lo, you have yours.
012526 His lord answered and said to him, Evil and slothful servant! You knew that I reaped where I did not sow, and gathered where I did not scatter,
012527 then you should have put my money to the exchangers, and coming I would have received my own with interest.
012528 Therefore take the talent from him and give it to him who has ten talents.
012529 For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will abound. But from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.
012530 And throw the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
012531 But when the Son of man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He shall sit on the throne of His glory.
012532 And all nations shall be gathered before Him. And He shall separate them from one another, as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats.
012533 And indeed He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats off the left.
012534 Then the King shall say to those on His right hand , Come, blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
012535 For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in;
012536 I was naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.
012537 Then the righteous shall answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry, and fed You ? Or thirsty, and gave You drink?
012538 When did we see You a stranger, and took You in? Or naked, and clothed You ?
012539 Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and came to You?
012540 And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers, you have done it to Me.
012541 Then He also shall say to those on the left hand , Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.
012542 For I was hungry, and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave Me no drink;
012543 I was a stranger and you did not take Me in; I was naked, and you did not clothe Me; I was sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.
012544 Then they will also answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?
012545 Then He shall answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.
012546 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting life.
012601 And it happened when Jesus finished all these sayings, He said to His disciples,
012602 You know that after two days the Passover comes, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
012603 Then the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, assembled together to the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
012604 And they consulted so that they might take Jesus by guile and kill Him .
012605 But they said, Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people.
012606 And when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
012607 a woman came to Him, having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on His head as He reclined.
012608 But when His disciples saw it , they were indignant, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
012609 For this ointment might have been sold for very much and given to the poor.
012610 When Jesus understood it , He said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work on Me.
012611 For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have Me.
012612 For in putting ointment on My body, she did it for My burial.
012613 Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be proclaimed in the whole world, that which this woman has done shall be spoken of also, for a memorial of her.
012614 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
012615 And he said to them , What will you give me, and I will betray Him to you? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.
012616 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.
012617 And on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, Where do You desire that we prepare for You to eat the Passover?
012618 And He said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master said, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.
012619 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them. And they made the passover ready.
012620 And when evening had come, He sat down with the Twelve.
012621 And as they ate, He said, Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.
012622 And grieving sorrowfully, they began to say, each one of them, Lord, not I am the one ?
012623 And He answered and said, He who dips his hand with Me in the dish, the same shall betray Me.
012624 The Son of man goes, as it has been written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.
012625 And answering, the one betraying Him, Judas, said, Master, Not am I the one ? He said to him, You said it .
012626 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it , and broke it , and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is My body.
012627 And He took the cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink all of it.
012628 For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
012629 But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom.
012630 And singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
012631 Then Jesus said to them, All of you will be offended because of Me this night. For it is written, "I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad."
012632 But after I have risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
012633 Peter answered and said to Him, though all shall be offended because of You, I will never be offended.
012634 Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that this night, before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times.
012635 Peter said to Him, though I should die with You, yet I will not deny You. All the disciples also said the same.
012636 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane. And He said to the disciples, Sit here while I go and pray there.
012637 And He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, and He began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
012638 Then He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Wait here and watch with Me.
012639 And He went a little further and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will .
012640 And He came to the disciples and found them asleep. And He said to Peter, What! Could you not watch with Me one hour?
012641 Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
012642 He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.
012643 And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.
012644 And He left them and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same word.
012645 Then He came to His disciples and said to them, Sleep on now and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
012646 Rise, let us be going; behold, he who is betraying Me is at hand.
012647 And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him came a great crowd with swords and clubs, being sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.
012648 And he who betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, He is the one, lay hold on Him.
012649 And coming up to Jesus immediately, he said, Hail, Master! And he kissed Him.
012650 And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.
012651 And, behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and he struck a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
012652 Then Jesus said to him, Put up your sword again into its place; for all who take the sword shall perish with a sword.
012653 Do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?
012654 But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?
012655 In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out in order to take Me with swords and clubs, as against a thief? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not lay hands on Me.
012656 But all this happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples fled, forsaking Him.
012657 And they who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
012658 But Peter followed Him afar off to the high priest's court, and he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.
012659 And the chief priests and the elders and all the sanhedrin sought false witness against Jesus, in order to put Him to death.
012660 But they found none; yea, though many false witnesses came, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came up
012661 and said, This one said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.
012662 And standing up, the high priest said to Him, Do you answer nothing? What is it that these witness against you?
012663 But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.
012664 Jesus said to him, You said it . I tell you more. From this time you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.
012665 Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.
012666 What do you think? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.
012667 Then they spat in His face and beat Him with the fist. And others struck Him with the palms of their hands,
012668 saying, Prophesy to us, Christ; who is the one who struck you?
012669 And Peter sat outside in the court. And a girl came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.
012670 But he denied all before them , saying, I do not know what you say.
012671 And when he had gone out into the porch, another saw him and said to those there, This one was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
012672 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
012673 And after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.
012674 Then he began to curse and to swear, I do not know the man. And immediately the cock crowed.
012675 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, Who said to him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.
012701 And it becoming early morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.
012702 And when they had bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
012703 Then he who had betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, sorrowing, Judas returned the thirty pieces of silver again to the chief priests and elders,
012704 saying, I have sinned, betraying innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? You see to that .
012705 And he threw the pieces of silver down in the temple and departed. And he went and hanged himself.
012706 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
012707 And they took counsel and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.
012708 Therefore that field was called, The Field of Blood, to this day.
012709 Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who had been priced, whom they of the children of Israel valued,
012710 and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me."
012711 And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say it .
012712 And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.
012713 Then Pilate said to Him, Do you not hear how many things they witness against you?
012714 And He did not answer him a word, so that the governor greatly marveled.
012715 Now at that feast the governor was accustomed to release to the people a prisoner, whomever they desired.
012716 And they then had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
012717 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you desire that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
012718 For he knew they had delivered Him because of envy.
012719 But as he was sitting down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just man, for today because of Him I have suffered many things in a dream.
012720 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
012721 The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you desire that I release to you? They said, Barabbas.
012722 Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said to him, Let Him be crucified.
012723 And the governor said, Why? What evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, let Him be crucified!
012724 But when Pilate saw that it gained nothing, but rather that a tumult was made, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person. You see to it.
012725 Then all the people answered and said, Let His blood be on us and on our children.
012726 Then he released Barabbas to them. And when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.
012727 Then taking Jesus into the praetorium, the soldiers of the governor gathered the cohort against Him.
012728 And stripping Him, they put a scarlet robe around Him.
012729 And plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
012730 And spitting at Him, they took the reed and struck at His head.
012731 And after they had mocked Him, they took the robe off of Him and put His own clothing on Him and led Him away to crucify Him .
012732 And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They forced this one to carry His cross.
012733 And coming to a place called Golgotha, which is called, Place of a Skull,
012734 they gave Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink. And when He had tasted, He would not drink.
012735 And they crucified Him, dividing His garments, casting a lot; so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, "They parted My garments among them, and they cast a lot for My clothing."
012736 And sitting down they guarded Him there.
012737 And they put up over His head His accusation, written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
012738 Then two thieves were crucified with Him, one off the right, one off the left.
012739 And those who passed by blasphemed Him, shaking their heads,
012740 and saying, You destroying the temple and building it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.
012741 And in the same way also the chief priests mocked, with the scribes and elders, saying,
012742 He saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
012743 He trusted in God, let Him deliver him now, if He will have him. (For He said, I am the Son of God.)
012744 And also the thieves who were crucified with Him reviled Him, saying the same.
012745 And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
012746 And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken me?
012747 Some of those who stood there, when they heard, said, This one calls for Elijah.
012748 And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar, and he put it on a reed and gave it to Him to drink.
012749 The rest said, Let Him alone, let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him.
012750 And crying again with a loud voice, Jesus released His spirit.
012751 And, behold! The veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks were sheared,
012752 and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep arose,
012753 and coming out of the tomb after His resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.
012754 But the centurion and those guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake, and the things that took place, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this One was Son of God.
012755 And many of the women were there, watching from a distance, those who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, watching from a distance;
012756 among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
012757 When the evening had come, a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, came, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.
012758 He went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
012759 When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in clean linen,
012760 and laid it in his new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and departed.
012761 And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, were sitting there across from the tomb.
012762 And on the next day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate,
012763 saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while He was living, After three days I will rise again.
012764 Then command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say to the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last error will be worse than the first.
012765 Pilate said to them, You have a watch. Go and make it as secure as you can.
012766 And going they made the tomb secure, sealing the stone along with the guard.
012801 But late in the week, at the dawning into the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
012802 And behold, a great earthquake occurred! For coming down from Heaven, and coming up, an angel of the Lord rolled back the stone from the door and was sitting on it.
012803 His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
012804 And the keepers shook for fear of him and became like dead men .
012805 And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not fear, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
012806 He is not here, for He has risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
012807 And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead. And, behold, He goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see Him. Lo, I have told you.
012808 And they quickly departed from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word.
012809 But as they were going to report to His disciples, behold, Jesus also met them, saying, Hail! And they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him.
012810 Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid; go tell My brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see Me.
012811 And as they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and declared all the things that were done to the chief priests.
012812 And being assembled with the elders, and taking counsel, they gave enough silver to the soldiers,
012813 saying, Say that His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we slept.
012814 And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free from care.
012815 And taking the silver, they did as they were taught. And this saying was spread among the Jews until today.
012816 And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
012817 And when they saw Him, they worshiped Him. But some doubted.
012818 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority is given to Me in Heaven and in earth.
012819 Therefore go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
012820 teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you. And, behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the world. Amen.
020101 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God:
020102 as it is written in the Prophets, "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.
020103 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight."
020104 John came baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
020105 And all the land of Judea, and those of Jerusalem, went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
020106 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather girdle about his loin. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
020107 And he proclaimed, saying, There is One coming after me who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down to loosen.
020108 I indeed have baptized you in water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
020109 And it happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
020110 And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.
020111 And there came a voice from Heaven, saying , You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
020112 And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.
020113 And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. And He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to Him.
020114 And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God,
020115 and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God draws near. Repent, and believe the gospel.
020116 And walking along beside the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
020117 And Jesus said to them, Come after Me and I will make you fishers of men.
020118 And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
020119 And when He going farther from there a little, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.
020120 And immediately He called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after Him.
020121 And they went into Capernaum. And immediately on the sabbath day He entered into the synagogue and taught.
020122 And they were astonished at His doctrine. For He taught them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes.
020123 And in their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,
020124 saying, What is to us and to You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.
020125 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him.
020126 And the unclean spirit, convulsing him, and crying with a loud voice, he came out of him.
020127 They all were amazed, so as to question among themselves, saying, What is this? What new doctrine is this? For He even commands the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey Him.
020128 And immediately His fame went out into all the Galilean neighborhood.
020129 And immediately after they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
020130 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and at once they told Him about her.
020131 And He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. And instantly the fever left her, and she served them.
020132 And at evening, when the sun set, they brought all those who were diseased to Him, and those who had been demon-possessed.
020133 And all the city had gathered at the door.
020134 And He healed many who were sick of different diseases, and cast out many demons. And He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.
020135 And rising up quite early in the night, He went out and went away into a deserted place, and He was praying there.
020136 And Simon, and those with him, searched for Him.
020137 And finding Him, they said to Him, All are seeking You.
020138 And He said to them, Let us go into the next towns so that I may proclaim there also. For that reason I came forth.
020139 And He proclaimed in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons.
020140 And a leper came to Him, begging Him and kneeling down to Him, and saying to Him, If You will, You can make me clean.
020141 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put out His hand and touched him, and said to him, I will; be clean!
020142 And He having spoken, the leprosy instantly departed from him and he was cleansed.
020143 And He strictly charged him and immediately sent him away,
020144 and He said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone. But go and show yourself to the priest, and offer those things which Moses commanded for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.
020145 But going out, he began to proclaim it very much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was outside in deserted places. And they came to Him from every quarter.
020201 And again He entered into Capernaum after some days. And it was heard that He was in a house.
020202 And immediately many were gathered, so that none any longer had room, even to the door. And He proclaimed the Word to them.
020203 Then they came to Him, bringing one who was paralyzed, who was carried by four.
020204 When they could not come near to Him because of the crowd, they unroofed the roof where He was. And digging through, they let down the cot on which the paralytic was lying.
020205 And seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven to you.
020206 But some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
020207 Why does this one speak such blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God only?
020208 And instantly knowing in His spirit that they reasoned so within themselves, He said to them, Why do you reason these things in your heart?
020209 Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and take up your cot and walk?
020210 But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority upon earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic,
020211 I say to you, Arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.
020212 And immediately he arose and took up his cot and went out before all. So that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw it this way.
020213 And He went out again by the seaside. And all the crowd came to Him, and He taught them.
020214 And as He passed on, He saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at the tax-office. And He said to him, Follow Me. And he arose and followed Him.
020215 And it happened as Jesus reclined in his house, many tax-collectors and sinners also reclined with Jesus and His disciples. For there were many, and they followed Him.
020216 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eat with tax-collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, How is it that He eats and drinks with tax-collectors and sinners?
020217 When Jesus heard, He said to them, They who are strong have no need of a physician, but the ones who have illness. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
020218 The disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him, Why do John's disciples and those of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?
020219 And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.
020220 But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.
020221 And no one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, else it takes away from its fullness, the new from the old, and a worse tear occurs.
020222 No one puts new wine into old wineskins, else the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine spills, and the wineskins will be ruined. The new wine must be put into new wineskins.
020223 And it happened that He went through the grainfields on the sabbath day. And as they walked His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain .
020224 And the Pharisees said to Him, Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the sabbath day?
020225 And He said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry, he, and those with him?
020226 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave to those with him?
020227 And He said to them, The sabbath came into being for man's sake, and not man for the sabbath's sake.
020228 Therefore the Son of man is also Lord of the sabbath.
020301 And He again entered into the synagogue. And a man was there who had a withered hand.
020302 And they watched Him to see if He would heal him on the sabbath day, so that they might accuse Him.
020303 And He said to the man who had the withered hand, Arise! Come into the middle.
020304 And He said to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? To save life, or to kill? But they were silent.
020305 And looking around on them with anger, being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he stretched it out. And his hand was restored whole, like the other.
020306 The Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.
020307 And Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples. And a great crowd from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea,
020308 and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan, and those around Tyre and Sidon, a great throng came to him, having heard how much He was doing.
020309 And He spoke to His disciples, so that a small boat should stay near to Him, because of the crowd, lest they should press on Him.
020310 For He had healed many, so that they pressed on Him in order to touch Him, as many as had plagues.
020311 And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, they fell down before Him and cried, saying, You are the Son of God!
020312 And He strictly charged them that they should not make Him known.
020313 And He went up into a mountain and called near those whom He would. And they came to Him.
020314 And He ordained twelve, that they should be with Him, and that He might send them out to proclaim,
020315 and to have authority to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons.
020316 And He put on Simon the name Peter.
020317 And He put on James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, the names Boanerges, which is, the Sons of Thunder.
020318 And He appointed Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
020319 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And they went into a house.
020320 And again a crowd came together, so that they could not even eat bread.
020321 And hearing, those with Him went out to take hold of Him; for they said, He is insane.
020322 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.
020323 And He called them and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
020324 And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
020325 And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
020326 And if Satan rises up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.
020327 No one can enter into a strong one's house and plunder his goods, except he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.
020328 Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme.
020329 But he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never shall have forgiveness, but is liable to eternal condemnation.
020330 Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.
020331 Then His brothers and His mother came. And standing outside, they sent to Him, calling Him.
020332 And the crowd sat about Him, and they said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking for You.
020333 And He answered them, saying, Who is My mother, or My brothers?
020334 And He looked around on those who sat about Him, and said, Behold My mother and My brothers!
020335 For whoever does the will of God, the same is My brother and My sister and My mother.
020401 And He began again to teach by the seaside. And there was a great crowd gathered to Him, so that He entered into a boat and sat in the sea. And the whole crowd was on the land by the seaside.
020402 And He taught them many things by a parable. And He said to them in His teaching:
020403 Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.
020404 And as he sowed, it happened that indeed some fell by the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and ate it up.
020405 And another fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth. And it sprang up at once, due to not having deepness of earth.
020406 And when the sun rose, it was scorched. And because it had no root, it withered away.
020407 And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
020408 And another fell on good ground and yielded fruit, going up and increasing. And one bore thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundredfold.
020409 And He said to them, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
020410 And when He was alone, they who were about Him, with the Twelve, asked Him concerning the parable.
020411 And He said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those outside, all these things are given in parables
020412 so that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.
020413 And He said to them, Do you not know this parable? And how then will you know all parables?
020414 The sower sows the Word.
020415 And these are those by the wayside, where the Word is sown. And when they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.
020416 And these are those likewise being sown on stony places; who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with gladness.
020417 But they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward when affliction or persecution arises for the Word's sake, they are immediately offended.
020418 And these are those being sown among thorns; such as hear the Word,
020419 and the cares of this world, and the deceit of riches, and the lust about other things entering in, choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.
020420 And these are those sown on good ground, who hear the Word and welcome it , and bear fruit, one thirty, one sixty, and one a hundredfold.
020421 And He said to them, Does a lamp come to be put under a grain-measure, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand?
020422 For there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed; nor became covered, but that it might come to the light.
020423 If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.
020424 And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With that measure which you measure, it shall be measured to you. And to you who hear, more shall be given.
020425 For he who has, more shall be given to him; and he who has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.
020426 And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
020427 and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.
020428 For the earth brings out fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.
020429 But when the fruit has been brought out, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.
020430 And He said, to what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or by what parable shall we compare it?
020431 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.
020432 But when it has been sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches, so as to enable the birds of the air to roost under its shade.
020433 And with many such parables He spoke the Word to them, as they were able to hear it .
020434 But he did not speak to them without a parable. And when they were alone, He explained all things to His disciples.
020435 And evening having come, He said to them on that day, Let us pass over to the other side.
020436 And when they had sent away the crowd, they took Him with them as He was in the boat. And there were also other little boats with Him.
020437 And there arose a windstorm, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full.
020438 And He was in the stern of the boat, asleep on a headrest. And they awakened Him and said to Him, Master, do You not care that we perish?
020439 And He awakened and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
020440 And He said to them, Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?
020441 And they feared exceedingly and said to one another, What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?
020501 And they came over to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.
020502 And when He had come out of the boat, immediately a man with unclean spirits met Him out of the tombs,
020503 who had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one could bind him, no, not with chains
020504 because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nor could anyone subdue him.
020505 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying and cutting himself with stones.
020506 And when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped Him,
020507 and cried with a loud voice, and said, What is to me and to You, Jesus, son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God not to torment me.
020508 For He said to him, Come out of the man, unclean spirit!
020509 And He asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion, for we are many.
020510 And he begged Him very much that He would not send them outside the country.
020511 And a great herd of pigs was feeding near the mountains.
020512 And all the demons begged Him, saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.
020513 And immediately Jesus allowed them. And the unclean spirits went out and entered into the pigs. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand), and were choked in the sea.
020514 And the ones who fed the pigs fled and told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
020515 And they came to Jesus and saw him who had been demon-possessed, and had the legion, sitting and clothed and right-minded, the one who had the legion. And they were afraid.
020516 And those who had seen told them how it happened to the one who had been demon-possessed, and about the pigs.
020517 And they began to beg Him to leave their borders.
020518 And when He had come into the boat, the former demoniac begged Him that he might be with Him.
020519 However Jesus did not allow him, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and has had mercy on you.
020520 And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all marvelled.
020521 And Jesus having crossed again by boat to the other side, a large crowd collected on Him. And He was near the sea.
020522 And, behold, one of the synagogue rulers came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet.
020523 And he begged Him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come, lay Your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and she shall live.
020524 And Jesus went with him. And many people followed Him and thronged Him.
020525 And a certain woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years,
020526 and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and had not been bettered any, but rather came to worse,
020527 having heard about Jesus, she came in the press behind and touched His garment.
020528 For she said, If I may but touch only His clothes, I will be cured.
020529 And instantly the fountain of her blood dried up. And she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
020530 And knowing instantly within Himself that power had gone out of Him, Jesus turned Himself around in the press and said, Who touched My clothes?
020531 And His disciples said to Him, You see the crowd pressing on You, and do You say, Who touched Me?
020532 And He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
020533 But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done in her, came and fell down before Him and told Him all the truth.
020534 And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be whole from your plague.
020535 While He still spoke, they came from the synagogue ruler's house, saying, Your daughter is dead; why do you still trouble the Teacher?
020536 But hearing the word spoken, Jesus said to the synagogue ruler, Do not be afraid, only believe.
020537 And He allowed no one to follow Him, except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.
020538 And He came to the synagogue ruler's and saw a tumult, and weeping and much wailing.
020539 And going in He said to them, Why do you make a tumult and weep? The girl is not dead, but sleeps.
020540 And they laughed at Him. But when He had put them all out, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those with Him, and went in where the child was lying.
020541 And He took the child's hand and said to her, Talitha koumi; (which interpreted is, Little girl, I say to you, arise!)
020542 And instantly the little girl arose and walked (for she was twelve years old ). And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
020543 And He strictly warned them that no one should know this. And He said to give her something to eat.
020601 And He went out from there and came into His native-place. And His disciples followed Him.
020602 And when the sabbath day had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing Him , were astonished, saying, Where does this one get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are done by his hands?
020603 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at Him.
020604 But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his native-place, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
020605 And He could do no work of power there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick ones, He healed them .
020606 And He marveled because of their unbelief. And He went around the villages, in a circuit, teaching.
020607 And He called the Twelve and began to send them out by two and two. And He gave them authority over unclean spirits,
020608 and commanded them that they take nothing in the way, except only a staff; no bag, no bread, no copper in the belt,
020609 but tying on sandals, and not to put on two tunics.
020610 And He said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, abide there until you depart from that place .
020611 And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
020612 And they went out and proclaimed that men should repent.
020613 And they cast out many demons, and anointed many who were sick with oil, and healed them .
020614 And king Herod heard of Him (for His name had become well-known,) and he said that John the Baptist had been raised from the dead, and therefore mighty works operate in him.
020615 Others said that it was Elijah. And others said that he is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
020616 But hearing Herod said, It is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead!
020617 For Herod himself had sent out and laid hold on John and had bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. For he had married her,
020618 and John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.
020619 And Herodias held it against him, and desired to kill him, but she could not.
020620 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man. And he kept him safe. And when he heard him, he did many things and heard him gladly.
020621 And a convenient day came, when Herod made a supper to great men on his birthday, and to the chiliarchs, and to the first ones of Galilee.
020622 And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced and pleased Herod, and those who reclined with him , the king said to the girl, Ask me whatever you desire from me, and I will give it to you.
020623 And he swore to her, Whatever you shall ask from me, I will give it to you, to the half of my kingdom.
020624 And she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
020625 And immediately going in with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I desire that you give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.
020626 And becoming deeply grieved, the king, because of his oath, and those reclining together, he did not wish to reject her.
020627 And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in the prison,
020628 and brought his head in a platter and gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother.
020629 And when his disciples heard, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.
020630 And the apostles gathered themselves to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.
020631 And He said to them, Come aside into a deserted place and rest a little. For there were many coming and going, and they had no opportunity even to eat.
020632 And they departed by boat into a deserted place.
020633 And the crowds saw them leaving, and many knew Him. And they ran together on foot there, out of the cities. And they went before them and came together to Him.
020634 And going out Jesus saw a large crowd. And He was moved with compassion toward them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.
020635 And it now becoming a late hour, His disciples came to Him and said, This is a deserted place and it is now a late hour.
020636 Send them away so that they may go to the surrounding fields and villages and buy loaves for themselves. For they have nothing to eat.
020637 He answered and said to them, You give them food to eat. And they said to Him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii of loaves and give them to eat?
020638 He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fish.
020639 And He commanded them all to recline, group by group, on the green grass.
020640 And they reclined group by group, by hundred and by fifty.
020641 And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to Heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to His disciples to set before them. And He divided the two fish to all.
020642 And they all ate and were filled.
020643 And they took up twelve hand baskets full of fragments, also from the fish.
020644 And those eating the loaves were about five thousand men.
020645 And immediately He constrained His disciples to get into the boat and to go before to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent away the crowd.
020646 And taking leave of them, He went away to the mountain to pray.
020647 And when evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.
020648 And He saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night He came toward them walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.
020649 But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a phantom, and cried out.
020650 For they all saw Him and were troubled. And immediately He talked with them, and said, Be of good cheer. I AM! Do not be afraid.
020651 And He went up into the boat to them. And the wind was cut off. And they were very much amazed within themselves beyond measure, and marveled.
020652 For they did not understand the miracle of the loaves, for their hearts were hardened.
020653 And crossing over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore.
020654 And when they had come out of the boat, at once knowing Him,
020655 they ran all around that neighborhood, and began to carry on cots those who were sick, wherever they heard He was.
020656 And wherever He entered, into villages or cities or country, they laid the sick in the streets and begged Him if only they might touch but the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made whole.
020701 And the Pharisees and some of the scribes came together to Him, having come from Jerusalem.
020702 And when they saw some of His disciples eating loaves with unclean hands, that is with unwashed hands, they found fault.
020703 For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they immerse their hands with the fist, holding the tradition of the elders.
020704 And coming from the market, they do not eat without immersing, and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the dippings of cups and pots, and of copper vessels, and of tables.
020705 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat loaves with unwashed hands?
020706 But He answered and said to them, Well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, "This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
020707 However, they worship Me in vain, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."
020708 For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the dippings of pots and cups. And many other such things you do.
020709 And He said to them, Do you do well to set aside the commandment of God, so that you may keep your own tradition?
020710 For Moses said, "Honor your father and your mother." And, "Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death."
020711 But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban! (that is, A gift to God , whatever you may profit by me)
020712 and you no longer allow him to do anything toward his father or mother,
020713 making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have delivered. And you do many such things.
020714 And calling near all the crowd, He said to them, Listen to Me, every one of you, and understand.
020715 There is nothing from outside a man which entering into him can defile him . But the things which come out of him, those are the ones that defile the man.
020716 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.
020717 And when He had entered into the house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable.
020718 And He said to them, Are you also without understanding? Do you not perceive that whatever enters into the man from outside cannot defile him,
020719 because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the waste-bowl, purifying all food?
020720 And He said, That which comes out of the man is what defiles the man.
020721 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
020722 thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
020723 All these evil things pass out from inside and defile the man.
020724 And He arose from there and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered into a house and desired no one to know it . But He could not be hidden.
020725 For a woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of Him and came and fell at His feet.
020726 The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by race. And she begged Him that He would cast the demon out of her daughter.
020727 But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be filled. For it is not right to take the children's loaves and to throw it to the dogs.
020728 And she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
020729 And He said to her, For this saying go, the demon has gone out of your daughter.
020730 And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter lay on the couch.
020731 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, He came to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the borders of the Decapolis.
020732 And they brought a deaf one to Him, hardly speaking. And they begged Him to put His hand on him.
020733 And He took him aside from the crowd and put His fingers into his ears. And He spat and touched his tongue.
020734 And looking up to Heaven, He sighed and said to him, Ephphatha! (that is, Be opened!)
020735 And instantly his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.
020736 And He commanded them, that they should tell no one. But the more He commanded them, so much the more they proclaimed it .
020737 And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.
020801 In those days, the crowd being very great and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and said to them,
020802 I have compassion on the crowd because they have now been with Me three days and have nothing to eat.
020803 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint in the way. For many of them come from afar.
020804 And His disciples answered Him, From where can a man satisfy these with loaves here in the wilderness?
020805 And He asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.
020806 And He commanded the people to recline on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, and He broke and gave to His disciples to set before them. And they set them before the people.
020807 And they had a few fish. And He blessed and commanded them to also serve these.
020808 So they ate and were filled. And they took up over and above seven lunch baskets of fragments.
020809 And they who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away.
020810 And immediately He entered into a boat with His disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha.
020811 And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking a sign from Heaven from Him, tempting Him.
020812 And He sighed deeply in His spirit and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, There shall no sign be given to this generation.
020813 And He left them. And entering into the boat again, He departed to the other side.
020814 And the disciples had forgotten to take loaves, and they did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them.
020815 And He charged them, saying, Take heed! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod.
020816 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no loaves.
020817 And knowing it , Jesus said to them, Why do you reason that it is because you have no loaves? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Have you still hardened your heart?
020818 Do you have eyes and do not see? Do you have ears and do not hear? And do you not remember?
020819 When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many hand baskets full of fragments did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve.
020820 And when the seven among four thousand, how many lunch baskets full of fragments did you take up? And they said, Seven.
020821 And He said to them, How do you not understand?
020822 And He came to Bethsaida. And they brought a blind man to Him and begged Him to touch him.
020823 And He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spat on his eyes and had put His hands on him, He asked Him if he saw anything.
020824 And he looked up and said, I see men as trees, walking.
020825 And after that He put His hands again on his eyes and made him look up. And he was restored and saw all clearly.
020826 And He sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.
020827 And Jesus and His disciples went out into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And in the way He asked His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?
020828 And they answered, John the Baptist. But others say Elijah, and others say one of the prophets.
020829 And He said to them, But who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said to Him, You are the Christ.
020830 And He charged them that they should tell no one of Him.
020831 And He began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
020832 And He spoke that saying openly. And Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him.
020833 But when He had turned around and looked on His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan! For you do not mind the things of God, but of the things of men.
020834 And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.
020835 For whoever will save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel's, he shall save it.
020836 For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
020837 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
020838 Therefore whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man shall also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.
020901 And He said to them, Truly I say to you that there are some of those who stand here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God come with power.
020902 And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John and led them up into a high mountain, apart by themselves. And He was transfigured before them.
020903 And His clothing became shining, exceedingly white as snow such as no fuller on earth could whiten them.
020904 And Elijah with Moses was seen by them, and they were talking with Jesus.
020905 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
020906 For he did not know what to say, for they were very much afraid.
020907 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son. Hear Him.
020908 And suddenly, looking around, they did not see anyone any more, except Jesus alone with themselves.
020909 And as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things that they had seen until the Son of man had risen from the dead.
020910 And they kept that saying within themselves, debating with one another what the rising from the dead is .
020911 And they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must first come?
020912 And He answered and told them, Elijah truly does come first and restores all things. And how has it been written of the Son of man that He should suffer many things and be despised?
020913 But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they desired, as it is written of him.
020914 And coming to His disciples, He saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.
020915 And immediately all the crowd, seeing Him, were greatly amazed, and they were running to Him to greet Him.
020916 And He asked the scribes, What are you discussing with them?
020917 And one of the crowd answered and said, Teacher, I have brought my son who has a dumb spirit to You.
020918 And wherever he seizes him, he dashes him. And he foams and gnashes his teeth and pines away. And I spoke to Your disciples that they should cast him out, and they could not.
020919 He answered him and said, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me!
020920 And they brought him to Him. And when he saw Him, the spirit immediately convulsed him. And he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming.
020921 And He asked his father, How long ago has it been since this came to him? And he said, From childhood.
020922 And oftentimes it has cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.
020923 Jesus said to him, If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.
020924 And immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief.
020925 And seeing that a crowd is running together, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and enter no more into him!
020926 And the spirit cried out, throwing him into convulsions, and came out of him. And he was like one dead, so that many said, He is dead.
020927 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
020928 And He entering into a house, His disciples asked Him privately, Why could we not cast him out?
020929 And He said to them, This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer and fasting.
020930 And going out from there, they passed through Galilee. And He desired that no one should know.
020931 For He taught His disciples and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him. And after He is killed, He shall rise the third day.
020932 But they did not understand that saying and were afraid to ask Him.
020933 And He came to Capernaum. And being in the house, He asked them, What was it that you disputed among yourselves in the way?
020934 But they were silent. For in the way they had disputed among themselves who was the greatest.
020935 And He sat down and called the Twelve and said to them, If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.
020936 And He took a child, and embraced it, and set him in their midst. And He said to them,
020937 Whoever receives one of such children on My name receives Me. And whoever receives Me does not only receives Me, but Him who sent Me.
020938 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in Your name, and he does not follow us. And we forbade him, because he does not follow us.
020939 But Jesus said, Do not forbid him. For there is no one who shall do a work of power in My name who can lightly speak evil of Me.
020940 For he who is not against us is for us.
020941 For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you belong to Christ, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
020942 And whoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in Me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck and he were cast into the sea.
020943 And if your hand offends you, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched
020944 where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
020945 And if your foot offends you, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame than to have two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched
020946 where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
020947 And if your eye offends you, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes to be cast into hell fire
020948 where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
020949 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
020950 Salt is good; but if the salt becomes saltless, with what will you season? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.
021001 And He arose from there. And He came into the borders of Judea by the other side of the Jordan. And again a crowd came together to Him. And as was His custom, He taught them again.
021002 And tempting Him, the Pharisees came to Him and asked Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?
021003 And He answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?
021004 And they said, Moses allowed a bill of divorce to be written, and to put her away.
021005 And Jesus answered and said to them, He wrote you this precept because of the hardness of your hearts.
021006 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
021007 For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife.
021008 And the two of them shall be one flesh. So then they are no longer two, but one flesh.
021009 Therefore what God has joined together, let not man put apart.
021010 And in the house His disciples asked Him again about the same.
021011 And He said to them, Whoever shall put away his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.
021012 And if a woman shall put away her husband and marries to another, she commits adultery.
021013 And they brought children to Him, so that He should touch them. And His disciples rebuked those bringing them .
021014 But when Jesus saw, He was much displeased and said to them, Allow the little children to come to Me and do not hinder them . For of such is the kingdom of God.
021015 Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter into it.
021016 And taking them up in His arms, He put His hands on them and blessed them.
021017 And when He had gone out into the way, one came running up and kneeled to Him, and asked Him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
021018 And Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except one, God.
021019 You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and your mother.
021020 And he answered and said to Him, Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.
021021 Then Jesus, beholding him, loved him and said to him, One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have and give it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come, take up the cross and follow Me.
021022 And he was sad at that saying and went away grieved, for he had great possessions.
021023 And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, How hardly those having riches will enter into the kingdom of God!
021024 And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answering again said to them, Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
021025 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich one to enter into the kingdom of God.
021026 And they were astonished beyond measure, saying to themselves, And who can be saved?
021027 And Jesus looking on them said, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.
021028 Then Peter began to say to Him, Lo, we have left all and have followed You.
021029 And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospel's sake,
021030 but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions, and in the world to come, eternal life.
021031 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
021032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem. And Jesus went before them. And they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took the Twelve again and began to tell them what would happen to Him,
021033 saying , Behold, we go up to Jerusalem. And the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes. And they will condemn Him to death and will deliver Him to the nations.
021034 And they will mock Him, and will scourge Him, and will spit on Him, and will kill Him. And the third day He shall rise again.
021035 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to Him, saying, Master, we desire that You should do for us whatever we shall ask.
021036 And He said to them, What do you desire that I should do for you?
021037 They said to Him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left hand, in Your glory.
021038 But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you ask. Can you drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
021039 And they said to Him, We can. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of, and with the baptism that I am baptized with you shall be baptized.
021040 But to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but to those for whom it is prepared.
021041 And when the ten heard, they began to be indignant with James and John.
021042 But Jesus called them and said to them, You know that they who are accounted rulers over the nations exercise lordship over them. And their great ones exercise authority on them.
021043 But it shall not be so among you. But whoever desires to be great among you, let him be your servant.
021044 And whoever of you desires to become first, he shall be servant of all.
021045 For even the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.
021046 And they came to Jericho. And as He with His disciples and a large crowd went out of Jericho, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, was sitting by the side of the highway, begging.
021047 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!
021048 And many warned him that he should be quiet, but he cried a great deal more, Son of David, have mercy on me!
021049 And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man , saying to him, Be of good comfort; rise up, He is calling you.
021050 And casting away his garment, he rose up and came to Jesus.
021051 And answering Jesus said to him, What do you desire that I should do to you? The blind man said to Him, My Lord, that I may see again.
021052 And Jesus said to him, Go, your faith has healed you. And instantly he saw again, and he followed Jesus in the way.
021101 And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent out two of His disciples.
021102 And He said to them, Go into the village over across from you. And as soon as you have entered into it, you will find a colt tied, on which no one of men has ever sat. Untie it and bring it .
021103 And if anyone says to you, Why do you do this? Say that the Lord has need of him, and immediately he will send him here.
021104 And they went, and they found the colt tied by the door outside, in a place where two ways met. And they untied him.
021105 And certain of those who stood there said to them, What are you doing, untying the colt?
021106 And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded. And they let them go.
021107 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and they threw their garments on it. And He sat on it.
021108 And many spread their garments in the way, and others cut down branches off the trees and scattered them in the way.
021109 And those going before, and those following, cried out, saying, Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
021110 Blessed is the kingdom of our father David, who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
021111 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple. And when He had looked around on all things, the hour already being late, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
021112 And on the next day, they going out of Bethany, He was hungry.
021113 And seeing a fig-tree with leaves afar off, He went to it , if perhaps He might find anything on it. And when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season of figs.
021114 And Jesus answered and said to it, No one shall eat fruit of you forever. And His disciples heard.
021115 And they came to Jerusalem. And entering into the temple, Jesus began to cast out those who bought and sold in the temple. And He overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
021116 And He would not allow any to carry a vessel through the temple.
021117 And He taught, saying to them, Is it not written, "My house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations?" But you have made it a den of thieves.
021118 And the scribes and the chief priests heard. And they sought how they might destroy Him. For they feared Him, because all the people were astonished at His doctrine.
021119 And when evening came, He went out of the city.
021120 And passing on early, they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots.
021121 And Peter, remembering, said to Him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which You cursed has withered away.
021122 And answering Jesus said to them, Have faith of God.
021123 For truly I say to you that whoever shall say to this mountain, Be moved and be cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he said shall occur, he shall have whatever he said.
021124 Therefore I say to you, All things, whatever you ask, praying, believe that you shall receive them , and it will be to you.
021125 And when you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive it so that also your Father in Heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
021126 But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive your trespasses.
021127 And they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him
021128 and said to Him, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority to do these things?
021129 And Jesus answered and said to them, I will also ask of you one thing, and answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
021130 The baptism of John, was it from Heaven, or from men? Answer Me.
021131 And they reasoned within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him?
021132 But if we shall say, From men, they feared the people, for all held John to be a prophet indeed.
021133 And they answered and said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And answering Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
021201 And He began to speak to them by parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a fence about it , and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and he let it out to vinedressers, and went away.
021202 And at the season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, so that he might receive from the vinedressers the fruit of the vineyard.
021203 And taking him , they beat him and sent him away empty.
021204 And again he sent to them another servant. And stoning that one, they struck him in the head, and sent him away, insulting him.
021205 And again he sent another. And they killed him, and many others, beating some and killing some.
021206 Therefore, still having one son, his own beloved, he also sent him to them last of all, saying, They will respect my son.
021207 But those vinedressers said among themselves, This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.
021208 And they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.
021209 Therefore what will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers and will give the vineyard to others.
021210 And have you not read this scripture " The Stone which the builders rejected has become the Head of the corner:
021211 this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes"?
021212 And they sought to seize him, but feared the crowd. For they knew that He spoke the parable against them. And leaving Him, they went away.
021213 And they sent certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him, to catch Him in His words.
021214 And coming, they said to Him, Teacher, we know that you are true and you care about no one. For you do not look to the face of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
021215 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, Why do you tempt Me? Bring me a denarius so that I may see.
021216 And they brought it . And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this? And they said to Him, Caesar's.
021217 And answering Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at Him.
021218 Then the Sadducees came to Him, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked Him, saying,
021219 Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother die and leaves his wife, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.
021220 And there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
021221 And the second took her, and died; neither did he leave any seed. And the third likewise.
021222 And the seven had her, and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.
021223 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.
021224 And answering Jesus said to them, Do you not err because of this, not knowing Scriptures, nor the power of God?
021225 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are as the angels in Heaven.
021226 And as regards the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses how God spoke to him in the Bush, saying, "I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?"
021227 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. Therefore you greatly err.
021228 And coming up one of the scribes heard them reasoning, knowing that He had answered them well, he asked Him, Which is the first commandment of all?
021229 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is , "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord;
021230 and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength." This is the first commandment.
021231 And the second is like this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.
021232 And the scribe said to Him, Right, Teacher, according to truth You have spoken, that God is one, and there is no other besides Him.
021233 And to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love the neighbor as himself, is more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
021234 And seeing that he had answered intelligently, Jesus said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared to question Him any more.
021235 And answering, teaching in the temple, Jesus said, How do the scribes say that Christ is the Son of David?
021236 For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: "The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies as Your footstool."
021237 David therefore himself calls Him Lord, and why then is He his son? And the great crowd heard Him gladly.
021238 And He said to them in His teaching, Beware of the scribes, who love to walk about in robes, and love greetings in the markets,
021239 and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts
021240 who devour widows' houses, and as a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater condemnation.
021241 And sitting down opposite the treasury, Jesus watched how the people threw copper coins into the treasury. And many rich ones threw in much.
021242 And a certain poor widow came, and she threw in two lepta, which is a kodrantes.
021243 And He called His disciples and said to them, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has cast in more than all those who have cast into the treasury.
021244 For all cast in from their abundance. But she, out of her poverty, has cast in all that she had, all her livelihood.
021301 And as He went out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, Master, see! What stones and what buildings!
021302 And answering Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? There shall not be one stone left on another that shall not be thrown down.
021303 And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, across from the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,
021304 Tell us, When shall all these things be? And what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
021305 And Jesus answering them began to say, Beware that no one deceive you.
021306 For many shall come in My name, saying, I AM, and shall deceive many.
021307 And when you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. For it must happen, but the end shall not be yet.
021308 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there shall be earthquakes in different places, and there shall be famines and troubles. These things are the beginnings of sorrows.
021309 But take heed to yourselves. For they shall deliver you up to sanhedrins, and in the synagogues you shall be beaten. And you shall be brought before rulers and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them.
021310 And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.
021311 But whenever they lead you away and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what you should speak or think. But speak whatever shall be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speaks, but the Holy Spirit.
021312 And a brother will betray a brother to death, and a father his son. And children will rise up against their parents and will cause them to be put to death.
021313 And you will be hated by all for My name's sake, but he enduring to the end, that one will be kept safe.
021314 But when you see the abomination of desolation, that spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
021315 And let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house.
021316 And let him who is in the field not turn back again in order to take up his garment.
021317 But woe to those with babe in womb, and to those who give suck in those days!
021318 And pray that your flight is not in the winter.
021319 For in those days shall be affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never shall be.
021320 And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved. But for the elect's sake, whom He has chosen, He has shortened the days.
021321 And then if anyone shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ! Or, lo, there! Do not believe him.
021322 For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give miraculous signs and wonders in order to seduce, if possible, even the elect.
021323 But take heed; behold, I have told you all things beforehand.
021324 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
021325 and the stars of Heaven shall fall, and the powers in the heavens shall be shaken.
021326 And then they will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
021327 And then He shall send His angels and shall gather His elect from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.
021328 And learn the parable of the fig-tree: when her branch is still tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.
021329 So you also, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, at the doors.
021330 Truly I say to you that this generation shall not pass away until all these things occur.
021331 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.
021332 But of that day and hour no one knows, no, not the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.
021333 Take heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time is.
021334 As a man going away, leaving his house, and giving authority to his servants, and each man's work to him, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch.
021335 Then you watch, for you do not know when the lord of the house is coming, at evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or early;
021336 lest he come suddenly and find you sleeping.
021337 And what I say to you, I say to all. Watch.
021401 And after two days it was the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take Him by craft and kill Him.
021402 But they said, Not during the Feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.
021403 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He reclined, a woman came with an alabaster vial of pure, costly ointment of spikenard. And she broke the vial and poured it on His head.
021404 And some were indignant to themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
021405 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and be given to the poor. And they were incensed with her.
021406 And Jesus said, Let her alone! Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work towards Me.
021407 For you have the poor with you always, and whenever you desire you may do them good. But you do not have Me always.
021408 She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint My body for the burying.
021409 Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be proclaimed in all the world, this also that she has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her.
021410 And Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them.
021411 And when they heard, they were glad and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might conveniently betray Him.
021412 And the first day of Unleavened Bread , when they killed the passover, His disciples said to Him, Where do You desire that we go and prepare that You may eat the passover?
021413 And He sent out two of His disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and there you shall meet a man bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him.
021414 And wherever he may go in, you say to the housemaster, The Teacher says, Where is the guest room where I shall eat the passover with My disciples?
021415 And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and prepared. Prepare there for us.
021416 And His disciples went out and came into the city and found it as He had said to them. And they made the passover ready.
021417 And in the evening He came with the Twelve.
021418 And as they reclined and ate, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, One of you will betray Me, the one eating with Me.
021419 And they began to be grieved, and to say to Him one by one, Not at all I, is it ? And another said, Not at all I, is it ?
021420 And answering He said to them, It is one of the Twelve, the one dipping with Me in the dish.
021421 The Son of man indeed goes, as it has been written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for that man if he had never been born.
021422 And as they ate, Jesus took a loaf and blessed and broke it , and He gave to them and said, Take, eat; this is My body.
021423 And taking the cup, giving thanks, He gave to them. And they all drank out of it.
021424 And He said to them, This is My blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many.
021425 Truly I say to you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
021426 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
021427 And Jesus said to them, All of you will be offended because of Me this night. For it is written, "I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered."
021428 But after I am raised, I will go before you into Galilee.
021429 But Peter said to Him, Although all shall be offended, yet I will not.
021430 And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that today, in this night, before the cock crows twice, you shall deny Me three times.
021431 But he spoke the more fervently, If I should die with You, I will not deny You in any way. Also they all said likewise.
021432 And they came to a place named Gethsemane. And He said to His disciples, Sit here while I pray.
021433 And He took with Him Peter and James and John. And He began to be greatly amazed, and to be very heavy.
021434 And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful to death. Stay here and watch.
021435 And He went forward a little and fell on the ground. And He prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him.
021436 And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to You. Take away this cup from Me. Yet not what I will, but what You will .
021437 And He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Could you not watch one hour?
021438 Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. Truly the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
021439 And again He went away and prayed and spoke the same words.
021440 And when He returned, He found them asleep again (for their eyes were heavy), neither did they know what to answer Him.
021441 And He came the third time and said to them, Sleep on now and take your rest. It is enough, the hour has come. Behold, the Son of man has been betrayed into the hands of sinners.
021442 Rise up, let us go. Lo, he who betrays Me is at hand.
021443 And immediately, while He still spoke, Judas, being one of the Twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
021444 And he who betrayed Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, it is He. Take Him and lead Him away safely.
021445 And coming, at once drawing near to Him, he said, Rabbi, Rabbi! And he ardently kissed Him.
021446 And they laid their hands on Him and seized Him.
021447 And one of those standing by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
021448 And answering Jesus said to them, Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to take Me?
021449 I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.
021450 And leaving Him, all fled.
021451 And one, a certain young man, followed Him, having thrown a linen cloth around his naked body . And the young men caught him.
021452 And he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.
021453 And they led Jesus away to the high priest. And with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
021454 And Peter followed Him from a distance to the inside of the court of the high priest. And he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire.
021455 And the chief priests and all the sanhedrin sought for witness against Jesus, to put Him to death. And they found none.
021456 For many testified falsely against Him, but the testimonies were not identical.
021457 And certain ones rose up and bore false witness against Him, saying,
021458 We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
021459 But neither was their testimony identical.
021460 And standing up in the middle, the high priest questioned Jesus, saying, Do you answer nothing? What do these witness against you?
021461 But He was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked Him, saying to Him, Are you the Christ, the son of the Blessed?
021462 And Jesus said, I AM! And you will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of the heaven.
021463 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, What further need do we have of witnesses?
021464 You have heard the blasphemy; what do you think? And they all condemned Him to be guilty of death.
021465 And some began to spit on Him, and to cover His face and to beat Him, and to say to Him, Prophesy! And the under-officers struck Him with slaps.
021466 And as Peter was below in the palace, one of the servant women of the high priest came.
021467 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked on him and said, And you also were with Jesus the Nazarene.
021468 But he denied, saying, I do not know nor even understand what you are saying. And he went out into the forecourt. And a cock crowed.
021469 And a servant woman saw him again and began to say to those who stood by, This one is of them.
021470 And he denied it again. And a little after, those who stood by said again to Peter, Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech agrees.
021471 But he began to curse and to swear, saying , I do not know this man of whom you speak.
021472 And the second time a cock crowed. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus said to him, Before a cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times. And thinking on it , he wept.
021501 And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.
021502 And Pilate asked Him, Are you the king of the Jews? And answering He said to him, You say it .
021503 And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing.
021504 And Pilate asked Him again, saying, Do you answer nothing? Behold how many things they witness against you!
021505 But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.
021506 And at that feast he released to them one prisoner, whomever they desired.
021507 And there was one named Barabbas, bound with the insurgents, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
021508 And the crowd, crying aloud, began to beg him to do as he had always done to them.
021509 But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you desire that I release to you the King of the Jews?
021510 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him because of envy.
021511 But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
021512 And Pilate answered and said again to them, What then do you desire that I should do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?
021513 And they cried out again, Crucify him!
021514 Then Pilate said to them, Why? What evil has he done? And they much more cried out, Crucify him!
021515 And deciding to do the easiest to the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Him , delivered up Jesus to be crucified.
021516 And the soldiers led Him away inside the court, which is the praetorium. And they called together all the cohort.
021517 And they clothed Him with purple and plaited a crown of thorns and put it around His head .
021518 And they began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!
021519 And they struck Him on the head with a reed, and spat on Him, and placing the knees, they bowed to Him.
021520 And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him and put His own clothes on Him and led Him out to crucify Him.
021521 And they made one who was passing by, Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear His cross.
021522 And they brought Him to Golgotha Place (which translated is, Place of a Skull).
021523 And they gave Him wine mixed with myrrh to drink. But He did not take it .
021524 And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots on them, as, to what each should take.
021525 And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.
021526 And the inscription of His accusation was written over Him , THE KING OF THE JEWS.
021527 And with Him they crucified two thieves, the one off the right, and one off the left.
021528 And the Scripture was fulfilled which said, "And he was numbered with the lawless."
021529 And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You razing the temple and building it in three days,
021530 save yourself and come down from the cross!
021531 And also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes, said to one another, He saved others but he cannot save himself.
021532 Let Christ the King of Israel now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe. And they who were crucified with Him insulted Him.
021533 And it being the sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.
021534 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? (which being translated is, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?)
021535 And hearing, some of those standing by said, Behold, he calls Elijah.
021536 And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. But they said , Let alone, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.
021537 And letting out a loud voice, Jesus expired.
021538 And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
021539 And when the centurion, who stood across from him, saw that He cried out so, and expired, he said, Truly this man was Son of God.
021540 And also women were watching from a distance, among whom also was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,
021541 (who also, when He was in Galilee, followed Him and ministered to Him), and many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.
021542 And it, becoming evening already, since it was the Preparation, that is, the day before sabbath,
021543 Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counsellor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
021544 And Pilate wondered if He were already dead. And calling the centurion, he asked him whether He had died already.
021545 And when he knew it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
021546 And he bought a linen cloth, and took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a tomb which was cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the tomb.
021547 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where He was laid.
021601 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of James and Salome, had bought sweet spices so that they might come and anoint Him.
021602 And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came upon the tomb, the sun having risen.
021603 And they said among themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?
021604 And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back, for it was very great.
021605 And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a long white garment. And they were frightened.
021606 And he said to them, Do not be frightened. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen, He is not here. Behold the place where they laid Him.
021607 But go tell His disciples and Peter that He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see Him, as He said to you.
021608 And they went out quickly and fled from the tomb. For they trembled and were amazed. Neither did they say anything to anyone, for they were afraid.
021609 And when Jesus had risen early the first day of the Sabbath, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons.
021610 She went and told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept.
021611 And those hearing that He lives, and was seen by her, they did not believe.
021612 After that He appeared in another form to two of them, walking and going into the country.
021613 And they went and told it to the rest. Neither did they believe those.
021614 Afterward He appeared to the Eleven as they reclined. And He reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen.
021615 And He said to them, Go into all the world, proclaim the gospel to all the creation.
021616 He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned.
021617 And miraculous signs will follow to those believing these things: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak new tongues;
021618 they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.
021619 Then indeed, after speaking to them, the Lord was taken up into Heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
021620 And going out, they proclaimed everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by miraculous signs following. Amen.
030101 Since many took in hand to draw up an account concerning the matters which have been borne out among us,
030102 even as those who from the beginning delivered to us, becoming eye-witnesses and ministers of the word,
030103 it seemed good to me also, following all things accurately from the very first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,
030104 so that you might know the certainty of those things in which you have been instructed.
030105 In the days of Herod, the king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah. And his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
030106 And they were both righteous before God, walking blameless in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
030107 And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren. And both were advanced in their days.
030108 And it happened in his serving in the order of his course, before God,
030109 according to the custom of the priests, it was his lot to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
030110 And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.
030111 And an angel of the Lord appeared to him as he was standing on the right of the altar of incense.
030112 And seeing this , Zacharias was troubled, and fear fell on him.
030113 But the angel said to him, Do not fear, Zacharias. For your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
030114 And you shall have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth.
030115 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall neither drink wine nor strong drink. And he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.
030116 And he shall turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.
030117 And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
030118 And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am old, and my wife is advanced in her days.
030119 And answering, the angel said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands before God. And I am sent to speak to you and to show you these glad tidings.
030120 And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed, because you did not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their time.
030121 And the people waited for Zacharias and marveled that he stayed so long in the temple.
030122 And when he came out, he could not speak to them. And they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was making signs to them, and remained speechless.
030123 And as soon as the days of his service were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
030124 And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived and hid herself five months, saying,
030125 So the Lord has dealt with me in the days in which He looked on me , to take away my reproach among men.
030126 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
030127 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary.
030128 And the angel came in to her and said, Hail, one receiving grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women.
030129 And when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying, and considered what kind of greeting this might be.
030130 And the angel said to her, Do not fear, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
030131 And behold! You shall conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name JESUS.
030132 He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God shall give Him the throne of His father David.
030133 And He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end.
030134 Then Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I do not know a man?
030135 And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you. Therefore also that Holy One which will be born of you shall be called Son of God.
030136 And behold, your cousin Elizabeth also conceived a son in her old age. And this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
030137 For with God nothing shall be impossible.
030138 And Mary said, Behold the servant of the Lord. Let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.
030139 And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah.
030140 And she entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
030141 And it happened as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,
030142 and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.
030143 And from where is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
030144 For lo, as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
030145 And blessed is she who believes, for there shall be a perfecting of those things which were told her from the Lord.
030146 And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,
030147 and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
030148 For He looked on the humiliation of His slave woman. For, behold, from now on all generations shall count me blessed.
030149 For the Mighty One has done great things for me; and holy is His name.
030150 And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.
030151 He has worked power with His arm, He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
030152 He has put down rulers from their seats and exalted the lowly,
030153 He has filled the hungry with good things, and He has sent away the rich empty.
030154 He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,
030155 as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.
030156 And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
030157 And the time was fulfilled to Elizabeth for her to bear. And she bore a son.
030158 And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard how the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.
030159 And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and were calling it Zacharias, after his father's name.
030160 And his mother answered and said, No, but he shall be called John.
030161 And they said to her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.
030162 And they made signs to his father as to how he would have him called.
030163 And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.
030164 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosened . And he spoke and praised God.
030165 And fear came on all who lived all around them. And all these things were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.
030166 And all those who heard laid them up in their hearts, saying, What kind of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
030167 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
030168 Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people
030169 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,
030170 as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from eternity;
030171 that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,
030172 to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant,
030173 the oath which He swore to our father Abraham,
030174 that He would grant to us, that we , being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear
030175 in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.
030176 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest, for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,
030177 to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,
030178 through the tender mercy of our God; by which the Dayspring from on high has visited us,
030179 to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
030180 And the child grew and became strong in spirit and was in the deserts until the day of his showing to Israel.
030201 And it happened in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
030202 (This taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
030203 And all went to be registered, each to his own city.
030204 And Joseph also went up from Galilee to be taxed (out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David).
030205 And he took Mary his betrothed wife, being with child.
030206 And while they were there, the days for her deliverance were fulfilled.
030207 And she brought forth her son, the First-born, and wrapped Him, and laid Him in a manger-- because there was no room for them in the inn.
030208 And in the same country there were shepherds living in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
030209 And lo, the angel of the Lord came on them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them. And they were grievously afraid.
030210 And the angel said to them, Do not fear. For behold, I give to you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
030211 For to you is born today, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
030212 And this is a sign to you. You will find the babe wrapped, lying in a manger.
030213 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,
030214 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
030215 And it happened as the angels departed from them into Heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Indeed, let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing which has happened, which the Lord made known to us.
030216 And hurrying they came and sought out both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.
030217 And seeing, they publicly told about the word spoken to them concerning this Child.
030218 And all those who heard marveled about the things spoken to them by the shepherds.
030219 But Mary kept all these sayings, meditating in her heart.
030220 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as was spoken to them.
030221 And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child, His name was called JESUS, the name called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
030222 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem, to present Him to the Lord
030223 (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord)
030224 and to offer a sacrifice according to that said in the Law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.
030225 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was on him.
030226 And it happened to him, being instructed by the Holy Spirit, he was not to see death before he would see the Christ of the Lord.
030227 And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And as the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do according to the custom of the law concerning Him,
030228 even he received Him in his arms and blessed God, and said,
030229 Lord, now You will let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word.
030230 For my eyes have seen Your Salvation
030231 which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples,
030232 a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of Your people Israel.
030233 And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken by him.
030234 And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this One is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against
030235 (yea, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
030236 And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in many days, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity.
030237 And she was a widow of eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and prayers night and day.
030238 And she coming in at that instant gave thanks to the Lord and spoke of Him to all those in Jerusalem eagerly expecting redemption.
030239 And when they had finished all things according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
030240 And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was on Him.
030241 And His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
030242 And when He was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the Feast.
030243 And fulfilling the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know.
030244 But they, supposing Him to have been in the company, went a day's journey. And they looked for Him among the kinsfolk and acquaintances.
030245 And when they did not find Him, they turned back to Jerusalem, seeking Him.
030246 And it happened that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.
030247 And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.
030248 And seeing Him, they were amazed. And His mother said to Him, Child, why have you done so to us? Behold, your father and I have looked for you, greatly distressed.
030249 And He said to them, Why did you look for Me? Do you not know that I must be about My Father's business ?
030250 And they did not understand the word which He spoke to them.
030251 And He went with them and came to Nazareth, and He was subject to them. But His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
030252 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.
030301 And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the Trachonitus country, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene--
030302 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests-- the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
030303 And he came into all the country around Jordan, proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,
030304 as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, " The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.
030305 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall be straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth.
030306 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God."
030307 Then he said to the crowd that came forth to be baptized by him, O generation of vipers! Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
030308 Therefore bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
030309 And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
030310 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
030311 He answered and said to them, He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. And he who has food, let him do likewise.
030312 And tax-collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?
030313 And he said to them, Continue to do no more than that commanded to you.
030314 And the soldiers also asked of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not forcibly extort anyone, nor accuse any falsely. And be content with your wages.
030315 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts concerning John, lest perhaps he was the Christ,
030316 John answered all, saying, I indeed baptize you with water, but He who is mightier than I comes, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose. He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,
030317 whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor and will gather the wheat into His storehouse. But He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.
030318 And then indeed exhorting many things, he proclaimed the gospel to the people.
030319 But Herod the tetrarch (being reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done)
030320 added still this above all, that he even shut John up in prison.
030321 And it happened in the baptizing of all the people, Jesus also being baptized, and praying, and the heaven was opened.
030322 And the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily shape, like a dove on Him. And a voice came from Heaven, which said, You are My Son, the Beloved; I am delighted in You.
030323 And Jesus Himself was beginning to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) son of Joseph, son of of Heli,
030324 son of of Matthat, son of of Levi, son of of Melchi, son of of Janna, son of of Joseph,
030325 son of of Mattathias, son of of Amos, son of of Nahum, son of of Esli, son of of Naggai,
030326 son of of Maath, son of of Mattathias, son of of Semei, son of of Joseph, son of of Juda,
030327 son of of Joanna, son of of Rhesa, son of of Zerubbabel, son of of Shealtiel, son of of Neri,
030328 son of of Melchi, son of of Addi, son of of Cosam, son of of Elmodam, son of of Er,
030329 son of of Joses, son of of Eliezer, son of of Jorum, son of of Matthat, son of of Levi,
030330 son of of Simeon, son of of Juda, son of of Joseph, son of of Jonan, son of of Eliakim,
030331 son of of Melea, the son of Menan, son of of Mattatha, son of of Nathan, son of of David,
030332 son of of Jesse, son of of Obed, son of of Boaz, son of of Salma, son of of Nahshon,
030333 son of of Amminadab, son of of Ram, son of of Hezron, son of of Pharez, son of of Judah,
030334 son of of Jacob, son of of Isaac, son of of Abraham, son of of Terah, son of of Nahor,
030335 son of of Serug, son of of Reu, son of of Peleg, son of of Eber, son of of Shelah,
030336 son of of Cainan, son of of Arphaxad, son of of Shem, son of of Noah, son of of Lamech,
030337 son of of Methuselah, son of of Enoch, son of of Jared, son of of Mahalaleel, son of of Cainan,
030338 son of of Enos, son of of Seth, son of of Adam, son of of God.
030401 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
030402 forty days, being tempted by the Devil. And in those days He ate nothing. And they being ended, He afterward was hungry.
030403 And the Devil said to Him, If you are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it might become bread.
030404 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written that "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God."
030405 And the Devil, leading Him up into a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
030406 And the Devil said to Him, All this power I will give you, and the glory of them; for it has been delivered to me. And I give it to whomever I will.
030407 Therefore if you will worship me, all shall be yours.
030408 And Jesus answered and said to him, Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve."
030409 And he brought Him to Jerusalem and sat Him on a pinnacle of the temple and said to Him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here.
030410 For it is written, "He shall give His angels charge over You, to keep You;
030411 and in their hands they shall bear You up, lest at any time You dash Your foot against a stone."
030412 And Jesus answering said to him, It has been said, "You shall not tempt the Lord your God."
030413 And when the Devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him for a time.
030414 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee. And a report went out throughout all the neighborhood concerning Him.
030415 And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
030416 And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And, as His custom was, He went in to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read.
030417 And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And unrolling the book, He found the place where it was written,
030418 "The Spirit of the Lord is on Me; because of this He has anointed Me to proclaim the Gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and new sight to the blind, to set at liberty those having been crushed,
030419 to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."
030420 And rolling up the book, returning it to the attendant, He sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on Him.
030421 And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears.
030422 And all bore witness to Him and wondered at the gracious words which came out of His mouth. And they said, Is this not Joseph's son?
030423 And He said to them, You will surely say this proverb to Me, Physician, heal yourself. Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your native-place.
030424 And He said, Truly I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his native-place.
030425 But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land.
030426 But Elijah was not sent to any of them, except to Zarephath, a city of Sidon, to a woman, a widow.
030427 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.
030428 And hearing these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath.
030429 And they rose up and thrust Him outside the city, and led Him up to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.
030430 But passing through the midst of them, He went away.
030431 And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.
030432 And they were astonished at His doctrine, for His word was with authority.
030433 And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon and cried out with a loud voice,
030434 saying, Let us alone! What is to us and to You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.
030435 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown him into the midst, he came out of him, not harming him.
030436 And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word is this! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.
030437 And a report about Him went out into every place of the neighborhood.
030438 And rising up from the synagogue, He entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was being seized with a great fever. And they asked Him for her.
030439 And standing over her, He rebuked the fever. And it left her. And immediately she arose and served them.
030440 And the sun sinking, all, as many as had sick ones with different kinds of diseases brought them to Him. And laying hands on each of them, He healed them.
030441 And also demons came out of many, crying out and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God! And rebuking them , He did not allow them to speak; for they knew Him to be the Christ.
030442 And day coming on, going out, He went into a deserted place. And the crowds looked for Him and came to Him, and held Him fast, not to pass away from them.
030443 And He said to them, I must proclaim the gospel, the kingdom of God, to other cities, because I was sent on this mission ,
030444 And He proclaimed in the synagogues of Galilee.
030501 And it happened that the crowd pressed on Him to hear the word of God, He stood by the lake of Gennesaret.
030502 And He saw two boats standing by the lake. But the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.
030503 And He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, He asked him to thrust out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the people out of the boat.
030504 And as He stopped speaking, He said to Simon, Launch out into the deep and let your nets down for a haul.
030505 And answering, Simon said to Him, Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing. Yet at Your word I will let down the net.
030506 And doing this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish. And their net was being torn.
030507 And they signaled the partners, those in the other boat, to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.
030508 And seeing, Simon Peter fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.
030509 For he and all who were with him were astonished at the haul of fish which they had taken,
030510 and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear, from now on you will be taking men alive.
030511 And bringing their boats onto land, forsaking all things, they followed Him.
030512 And it happened, as He was in a certain city, behold, a man full of leprosy! And seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You will, You can cleanse me.
030513 And stretching out the hand, He touched him, saying, I will! Be clean! And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
030514 And He commanded him, Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
030515 But the word about Him spread even more. And great crowds were coming to hear, and to be healed from their infirmities by Him.
030516 But He was drawing back in the wilderness, and praying.
030517 And it happened on one of the days, even He was teaching. And Pharisees and teachers of the Law were sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was there, for the curing of them.
030518 And behold, men carrying, on a cot, a man who was paralyzed. And they sought to bring him in and to lay him before Him.
030519 And not finding a way by which they might bring him in through the crowd, going up on the housetop, they let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst, before Jesus.
030520 And seeing their faith, He said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.
030521 And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, except God alone?
030522 But knowing their thoughts, answering, Jesus said to them, Why do you reason in your hearts?
030523 Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Rise up and walk?
030524 But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic, I say to you, Arise, and take up your cot and go to your house.
030525 And immediately he rose up before them and took up that on which he lay. And he departed to his own house, glorifying God.
030526 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We saw wonderful things today.
030527 And after these things He went out and saw a tax-collector named Levi, sitting at the tax-office. And He said to him, Follow Me.
030528 And leaving all, he rose up and followed Him.
030529 And Levi made a great feast in his own house for Him. And there was a great company of tax-collectors and of others who were reclining with them.
030530 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax-collectors and sinners?
030531 And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are sound do not need a physician, but those who are sick.
030532 I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.
030533 And they said to Him, Why do John's disciples fast often and make prayers, and also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?
030534 But He said to them, Can you make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?
030535 But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.
030536 And He also spoke a parable to them: No one puts a piece of a new garment on an old garment. Otherwise, both the new will tear, and the old does not match the piece from the new.
030537 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskin will perish.
030538 But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.
030539 Also no one having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, The old is better.
030601 And it happened on the second chief sabbath, He went through the grain fields. And His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.
030602 And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
030603 And answering, Jesus said to them, Have you not read this, what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him;
030604 how he went into the house of God and took the showbread, and ate (and also gave to those who were with him) which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests alone?
030605 And He said to them, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
030606 And it happened, also on another sabbath, that He entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man whose right hand was withered.
030607 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him to see if He would heal on the sabbath day, so that they might find an accusation against Him.
030608 But He knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up and stand in the middle. And he arose and stood.
030609 Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil, to save life, or to destroy it ?
030610 And looking around on them all, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he did so. And his hand was restored whole like the other.
030611 And they were filled with madness, and talked with one another as to what they might do to Jesus.
030612 And it happened in those days that He went out into a mountain to pray, and He was spending the night in prayer to God.
030613 And when it was day, He called His disciples. And He chose twelve of them, whom He also named apostles:
030614 Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;
030615 Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alpheus, and Simon who was called Zelotes;
030616 Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also became the betrayer.
030617 And coming down with them, He stood on a level place. And a crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon (who came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases) were there;
030618 also those tormented by unclean spirits; and they were healed.
030619 And all the crowd sought to touch Him, for power went out of Him and healed them all.
030620 And lifting up His eyes to His disciples, He said, Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
030621 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.
030622 Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall cut you off, and when they shall reproach you and shall cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of man.
030623 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. For behold, your reward is great in Heaven. For so their fathers did according to these things to the prophets.
030624 But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.
030625 Woe to you who are full! For you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now! For you shall mourn and weep.
030626 Woe to you when all men shall speak well of you! For so their fathers did to the false prophets.
030627 But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
030628 bless those who curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you.
030629 And to him who strikes you on the one cheek, also offer the other. And to him who takes away your garment, do not forbid your tunic also.
030630 Give to everyone who asks of you, and from him who takes away your goods, do not ask them again.
030631 And as you desire that men should do to you, you do also to them likewise.
030632 For if you love those who love you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also love those who love them.
030633 And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also do the same.
030634 And if you lend to those of whom you hope to receive, what thanks do you have? For sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.
030635 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return . And your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest. For He is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.
030636 Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
030637 Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.
030638 Give, and it shall be given to you, good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over, they shall give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you measure, it shall be measured to you again.
030639 And He spoke a parable to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?
030640 The disciple is not above his master, but everyone who is perfect shall be like his master.
030641 And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brother's eye, but do not see the beam that is in your own eye?
030642 Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the splinter in your eye, when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First cast out the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the splinter that is in your brother's eye.
030643 For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit, neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
030644 For every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.
030645 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth the good. And an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth the evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
030646 And why do you call Me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?
030647 Whoever comes to Me and hears My words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.
030648 He is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock; and a flood occurring, the stream burst against that house and could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock.
030649 But he who hears and does not perform, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, on which the stream burst, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.
030701 And when He had ended all His words in the ears of the people, He entered into Capernaum.
030702 And a certain servant of a centurion who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die.
030703 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent the elders of the Jews to Him, begging Him that He would come and heal his servant.
030704 And coming to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that he was worthy, he for whom You give this;
030705 for, they said , He loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.
030706 Then Jesus went with them. But He being yet not far off from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself. For I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.
030707 Therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come to You; but say a word, and my servant will be healed.
030708 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it .
030709 And hearing these things, Jesus marveled at him. And turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, I have not found such faith, no, not in Israel.
030710 And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the sick servant well.
030711 And it happened on the next day, He went into a city called Nain. And many of His disciples and a great crowd went with Him.
030712 And drawing near the gate of the city, even behold, one having died was being carried out, an only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a considerable crowd of the city was with her.
030713 And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep.
030714 And He came and touched the bier. And the ones who bore him stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!
030715 And the one who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He delivered him to his mother.
030716 And fear came on all. And they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.
030717 And this report of Him went out in all Judea, and in all the neighborhood.
030718 And his disciples reported all these things to John.
030719 And John, calling near a certain two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are You He that should come, or do we look for another?
030720 And coming to Him, the men said, John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, Are You He who should come, or do we look for another?
030721 And in the same hour He cured many of infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits. And He gave sight to many who were blind.
030722 And answering, Jesus said to them, Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is proclaimed to the poor.
030723 And blessed is he who shall not be offended in Me.
030724 And when the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the people concerning John. What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
030725 But what did you go out to see? A man clothed with soft clothing? Behold, those in splendid clothing and being in luxury are in kings' palaces.
030726 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
030727 This is he of whom it is written, "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You."
030728 For I say to you, Among those who are born of woman there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
030729 And all the people and the tax-collectors who heard Him justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
030730 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not being baptized by him.
030731 And the Lord said, To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they like?
030732 They are like children sitting in a market and calling to one another, and saying, We have played the flute to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you did not weep.
030733 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.
030734 The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners!
030735 But wisdom has been justified by all her children.
030736 And one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, He reclined.
030737 And behold, a woman, a sinner in the city, knowing that He reclined in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster vial of ointment.
030738 And she stood behind Him , weeping at His feet, and she began to wash His feet with tears and wipe them with the hair of her head. And she ardently kissed His feet and anointed them with the ointment.
030739 But seeing this, the Pharisee who had invited Him, spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, for she is a sinner.
030740 And answering, Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, speak.
030741 There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
030742 And they having nothing to pay, he freely forgave both. Then which of them do you say will love him most?
030743 And answering, Simon said, I suppose that one to whom he forgave most. And He said to him, You have judged rightly.
030744 And He turned to the woman and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, yet you gave Me no water for My feet. But she has washed My feet with tears, and has wiped them with the hair of her head.
030745 You gave Me no kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet.
030746 You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.
030747 Therefore I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.
030748 And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.
030749 And those reclining with Him began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?
030750 And He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.
030801 And it happened afterwards, He traveled in every city and village, proclaiming and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with Him,
030802 and also certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,
030803 and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to Him of their possessions.
030804 And a great crowd coming together, and those in each city coming to Him, He spoke by a parable:
030805 A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, the one fell by the roadside and was trampled; and the birds of the air devoured it.
030806 And other fell on a rock, and sprouting, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
030807 And other fell amidst thorns, and springing up with the thorns, they choked it.
030808 And other fell on good ground and sprang up, and bore fruit a hundredfold. And when He had said these things, He cried, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
030809 And His disciples asked Him, saying, What might this parable be?
030810 And He said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God. But to others I speak in parables, so that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand.
030811 And the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.
030812 Those by the roadside are the ones who hear; then the Devil comes and takes the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
030813 Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear, receive the Word with joy. And these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
030814 And those which fell among thorns are the ones who, when they have heard, go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life, and do not bear to maturity.
030815 But those on the good ground are the ones who, in an honest and good heart, having heard the Word, keep it and bring forth fruit with patience.
030816 And no one lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch; but he sets it on a lampstand so that those who enter in may see the light.
030817 For nothing is secret that shall not be revealed; nor secret which shall not be known and come to be revealed.
030818 Therefore be careful how you hear. For whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.
030819 And His mother and His brothers came to Him. And they could not come near Him because of the crowd.
030820 And it was told to Him by some , who said, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside desiring to see You.
030821 And He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are those who hear the Word of God and do it.
030822 And it happened on a certain day that He went into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put out to sea.
030823 But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a storm of wind came onto the lake. And they were being filled with water and were in jeopardy.
030824 And they came to Him and awakened Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! Then being aroused, He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.
030825 And He said to them, Where is your faith? And being afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this One? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!
030826 And they sailed down to the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.
030827 And He going out onto land, He met a certain man out of the city, who had had demons a long time, and put on no clothes, nor stayed in a house, but among the tombs.
030828 And seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him and said with a loud voice, What is to me and to You, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I beseech You, Do not torment me!
030829 (For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had seized him. And he had been kept bound in chains and in fetters, and he broke the bands and was driven into the deserted places by the demons.)
030830 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.
030831 And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.
030832 And there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain. And they begged Him that He would allow them to enter into them. And He allowed them.
030833 And coming out of the man, the demons entered into the pigs. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked.
030834 And those feeding the pigs , and seeing the thing, fled. And leaving, they reported to the city and to the farms.
030835 And they went out to see what had been done. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had departed sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.
030836 Also those who saw it told them how the demon-possessed one was healed.
030837 And all the multitude of the neighborhood of the Gadarenes were seized with a great fear, and asked Him to depart from them. And entering into the boat, He returned.
030838 And the man out of whom the demons had gone out begged Him, desiring to be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,
030839 Return to your own house and declare what God has done to you. And he went his way and proclaimed throughout all the city what great things Jesus had done to him.
030840 And it happened when Jesus had returned, the people received Him. For they were all waiting for Him.
030841 And behold, a man named Jairus came, and he was a synagogue-ruler. And he fell down at Jesus' feet and begged Him that He would come into his house.
030842 For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as He went, the people thronged Him.
030843 And a woman who had a flow of blood twelve years (who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any)
030844 came behind Him and touched the border of His garment. And instantly her flow of blood was staunched.
030845 And Jesus said, Who touched Me? And all having denied, Peter and those with Him said, Master, the crowd presses and jostles You, and You say, Who touched Me?
030846 And Jesus said, Someone has touched Me, for I know that power has gone out of Me.
030847 And seeing that she was not hidden, the woman came trembling. And falling down before Him, she declared to Him before all the people why she had touched Him, and how she was instantly healed.
030848 And He said to her, Daughter, be comforted. Your faith has saved you; go in peace.
030849 He was still speaking when someone came from the synagogue-ruler, saying to him, Your daughter is dead, do not trouble the Teacher.
030850 But when Jesus heard, He answered Him, saying, Do not fear, only believe and she shall be healed.
030851 And coming into the house, He allowed no one to go in, except Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the girl.
030852 And all were weeping and bewailing her. But He said, Do not weep; she has not died, but sleeps.
030853 And they ridiculed, knowing that she was dead.
030854 And He put them all out. And He took her by the hand and called, saying, Little girl, arise!
030855 And her spirit came again, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that food be given her to eat.
030856 And her parents were astonished. But He charged them to tell no one the thing that happened.
030901 And He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases.
030902 And He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
030903 And He said to them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staffs, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money, nor each to have two tunics.
030904 And whatever house you enter into, abide there and depart from there.
030905 And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
030906 And they departed and went through the towns, proclaiming the gospel and healing everywhere.
030907 And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things happening by Him. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead;
030908 and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets had risen again.
030909 And Herod said, John I have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see Him.
030910 And returning, the apostles told Him all that they had done. And He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.
030911 But knowing this , the crowds followed Him. And He received them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and He healed those who had need of healing.
030912 But the day began to wear away, and coming up the Twelve said to Him, Send the crowd away so that they may go into the villages and farms all around, and lodge, and get food. For we are here in a deserted place.
030913 But He said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.
030914 (For they were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, Make them recline by fifties in a company.
030915 And they did so, and made them all recline.
030916 And He took the five loaves and the two fish. And looking up to Heaven, He blessed them and broke, and He gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.
030917 And they ate and were all filled. And there was taken up twelve hand baskets full of fragments of that left over to them.
030918 And it happened as He was alone praying, the disciples were with Him. And He asked them, saying, Whom do the crowds say that I am?
030919 Answering, they said, John the Baptist; but some say , Elijah, and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.
030920 He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Answering, Peter said, The Christ of God.
030921 And He strictly charged them and commanded to tell no one this,
030922 saying, The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.
030923 And He said to all, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.
030924 For whoever will save his life shall lose it, but whoever will lose his life for My sake, he shall save it.
030925 For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world and loses himself, or is cast away?
030926 For whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words, the Son of man shall be ashamed of him when He shall come in His own and in His Father's glory, and that of the holy angels.
030927 But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God.
030928 And about eight days after these sayings, He took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray.
030929 And as He prayed, the appearance of His countenance was altered, and His clothing was dazzling white.
030930 And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,
030931 who appeared in glory and spoke of His exodus, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
030932 But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep. But fully awakening, they saw His glory, and the two men who stood with Him.
030933 And in their parting from Him, it happened that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah; not knowing what he said.
030934 And as he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them. And they feared as they entered into the cloud.
030935 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, hear Him.
030936 And when the voice occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they were silent, and told no one in those days anything which they had seen.
030937 And it happened on the next day, they coming down from the mountain, a huge crowd met Him.
030938 And behold, a man cried aloud from the crowd, saying, Teacher, I beseech You, look on my son, for he is my only-born son.
030939 And lo, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out. And it throws him into convulsions, with foaming, and with pain departs from him, bruising him.
030940 And I begged Your disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
030941 And answering, Jesus said, O unbelieving generation, one having been perverted, how long shall I be with you and endure you? Bring your son here.
030942 And as he was still coming, the demon violently convulsed and tore him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father.
030943 And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But as all were marveling at all things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,
030944 Let these words sink down into your ears. For the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men.
030945 But they did not understand this, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it. And they feared to ask Him of this word.
030946 And an argument came in among them, who might be the greater of them.
030947 And seeing the argument of their heart, Jesus took a child and set him beside Him.
030948 And He said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in My name receives Me. And whoever shall receive Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all, he shall be great.
030949 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in Your name. And we prevented him, because he does not follow us.
030950 And Jesus said to him, Do not prevent him , for he who is not against us is for us.
030951 And it happened in the fulfilling of the days of His taking up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.
030952 And He sent messengers before His face. And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for Him.
030953 And they did not receive Him, because His face was going toward Jerusalem.
030954 And seeing, His disciples James and John said, Lord, do You desire that we command fire to come down from Heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?
030955 But He turned and rebuked them and said, You do not know of what spirit you are.
030956 For the Son of man has not come to destroy men's lives, but to save. And they went to another village.
030957 And it happened as they were going in the way, one said to Him, Lord, I will follow You wherever You go.
030958 And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay His head.
030959 And He said to another, Follow Me! But he said, Lord, first allow me to go and bury my father.
030960 Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.
030961 And another also said, Lord, I will follow You, but first allow me to take leave of those in my house.
030962 And Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
031001 And after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, And He sent them two and two before His face into every city and place where He was about to come.
031002 Then He said to them, The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest that He may send forth laborers into His harvest.
031003 Go! Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
031004 Carry neither purse nor bag nor sandals. And greet no one by the way.
031005 And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house.
031006 And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest on it. If not, it shall return to you,
031007 And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things shared by them; for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not move from house to house.
031008 And into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.
031009 And heal the sick that are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near you!
031010 And into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, going out into the streets say,
031011 Even the dust of your city which clings to us, we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near you.
031012 But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
031013 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented a long while ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
031014 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you.
031015 And you, Capernaum, which has been lifted up to Heaven, you shall be thrust down into hell.
031016 The one hearing you hears Me, and he who despises you despises Me; he who rejects you also rejects Him who sent Me.
031017 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through Your name.
031018 And He said to them, I saw Satan fall from Heaven like lightning.
031019 Behold, I give to you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the authority of the enemy. And nothing shall by any means hurt you.
031020 Yet do not rejoice in this, that the evil spirits are subject to you, rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven.
031021 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in Spirit and said, I thank You, Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the sophisticated and cunning, and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it was pleasing before You.
031022 All things are delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son will reveal Him .
031023 And He turned to His disciples and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see.
031024 For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen them , and to hear what you hear, and have not heard them .
031025 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted Him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
031026 He said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read it?
031027 And answering, he said, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.
031028 And He said to him, You have answered right; do this and you shall live.
031029 But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
031030 And answering, Jesus said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothing and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
031031 And by coincidence a certain priest came down that way and seeing him, he passed by on the opposite side .
031032 And in the same way a Levite, also being at the place, coming and seeing him , he passed on the opposite side .
031033 But a certain traveling Samaritan came upon him, and seeing him, he was filled with pity.
031034 And coming near, he bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
031035 And going on the next day, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him. And whatever more you spend, when I come again I will repay you.
031036 Then which of these three, do you think, was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?
031037 And he said, The one doing the deed of mercy to him. And Jesus said to him, Go and do likewise.
031038 And as they went, it happened that He entered into a certain village. And a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house.
031039 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and heard His word.
031040 But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she came to Him and said, Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.
031041 And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.
031042 But one thing is needful, and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
031101 And it happened as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught His disciples.
031102 And He said to them, When you pray, say: Our Father, who is in Heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come, Your will be done, as in Heaven, so also on the earth.
031103 Give us day by day our daily bread,
031104 and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
031105 And He said to them, which of you shall have a friend and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,
031106 for a friend of mine has come from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him?
031107 And he answering from inside may say, Do not trouble me. The door is now shut and my children are in bed with me. I cannot rise and give to you.
031108 I say to you, though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needs.
031109 And I say to you, Ask and it shall be given you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened to you.
031110 For everyone who asks receives. And he who seeks finds. And to him who knocks it shall be opened.
031111 For what father of you, if the son asks for bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a snake for a fish?
031112 Or if he shall ask for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
031113 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?
031114 And He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it happened as the demon was going out, the dumb one spoke. And the people marveled.
031115 But some of them said, He casts out demons through Beelzebub the chief of the demons.
031116 And others, tempting Him , sought a sign from Heaven from him.
031117 But knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And a house divided against a house falls.
031118 If Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub.
031119 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
031120 But if I cast out demons with the finger of God, no doubt the kingdom of God has come on you.
031121 When the strong man, fully armed, guards his dwelling, his goods are in peace.
031122 But when one stronger than he comes, he overcomes him. He takes from him all his armor in which he trusted, and he distributes his arms.
031123 He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
031124 When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he walks through dry places seeking rest. And finding none, he says, I will return to my house from which I came out.
031125 And when he comes, he finds it swept and decorated.
031126 And he goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and entering in, they dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first.
031127 And it happened as He spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said to Him, Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts which You have sucked.
031128 But He said, No; rather, blessed are they who hear the Word of God and keep it.
031129 But the crowds pressing on Him , He began to say, This is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
031130 For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also shall the Son of man be to this generation.
031131 The queen of the south shall rise up in the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, One greater than Solomon is here.
031132 The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, One greater than Jonah is here.
031133 No one, when he has lighted a lamp, puts it in a secret place, or under a grain-measure, but on a lampstand, so that they who come in may see the light.
031134 The light of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is sound, your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is evil, your body also is full of darkness.
031135 Therefore take heed that the light in you is not darkness.
031136 Therefore if your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the shining of a lamp enlightens you.
031137 And as He spoke , a certain Pharisee asked Him to dine with him. And He went in and reclined.
031138 And when the Pharisee saw it , he was amazed that He had not first washed before dinner.
031139 And the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and the platter clean, but your inward part is full of plunder and wickedness.
031140 Fools! Did not He who made the outside also make the inside?
031141 But give alms of such things as you have, and behold, all things are clean to you.
031142 But woe to you, Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over judgment and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to leave the other undone.
031143 Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets.
031144 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like unseen tombs and the men walking above are not aware of them.
031145 And one of the lawyers answered and said to Him, Master, you reproach us also when you say this.
031146 And He said, Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens grievous to be carried, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
031147 Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
031148 Truly you bear witness that you consent to the deeds of your fathers. For they indeed killed them, and you build their tombs.
031149 Therefore the wisdom of God also said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute,
031150 so that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
031151 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple. Truly I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.
031152 Woe to you, lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and you have hindered those who were entering in.
031153 And as He said these things to them, the scribes and Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw Him out concerning many things,
031154 lying in ambush for Him, and seeking to catch something out of His mouth, so that they might accuse Him.
031201 In the meantime, when there had gathered together an innumerable crowd of people, so as to trample on one another, He began to say to His disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
031202 For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, nor anything hidden that shall not be known.
031203 Therefore whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light. And that which you have spoken in the ear in secret rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops.
031204 And I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
031205 But I will warn you of whom you shall fear: Fear Him who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yea, I say to you, fear Him.
031206 Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? And not one of them is forgotten before God.
031207 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore do not fear, you are of more value than many sparrows.
031208 Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess Me before men, the Son of man also shall confess him before the angels of God.
031209 But he who denies Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.
031210 And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him. But to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.
031211 And when they bring you into the synagogues, and to rulers and authorities, take no thought as to how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say.
031212 For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say.
031213 And one of the company said to Him, Master, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
031214 And He said to him, Man, who made Me a judge or a divider over you?
031215 And He said to them, Watch and keep yourselves from covetousness. For a man's life is not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.
031216 And He spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully.
031217 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room in which to store my fruits?
031218 And he said, I will do this. I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones, and I will store all my fruits and my goods there.
031219 And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat drink and be merry.
031220 But God said to him, Fool! This night your soul shall be required of you, then whose shall be those things which you have prepared?
031221 So is he who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.
031222 And He said to His disciples, Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious as to your life, what you shall eat; nor for the body, what you shall put on.
031223 Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
031224 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap, having neither storehouse nor barn, and God feeds them. How much more are you better than the birds?
031225 And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?
031226 If then you are not able to do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest?
031227 Consider the lilies, how they grow; they do not toil, they do not spin. And yet I say to you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
031228 If then God so clothes the grass (which today is in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven) how much more will He clothe you, O little-faiths?
031229 And do not seek what you shall eat, nor what you shall drink, and stop being in anxiety.
031230 For all these things the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that you have need of these things.
031231 But rather seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.
031232 Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
031233 Sell what you have and give alms. Make for yourselves purses which do not become old, an unfailing treasure in Heaven, where no thief comes nor moth corrupts.
031234 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
031235 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning.
031236 And you yourselves be like men who wait for their lord, whenever he shall return from the wedding, so that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately.
031237 Blessed are those servants whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Truly I say to you that he shall gird himself and make them recline; and coming up he will serve them.
031238 And if he comes in the second watch, or comes in the third watch, and find it so, blessed are those servants.
031239 And know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be dug through.
031240 Therefore be ready also, for the Son of man comes at an hour when you think not.
031241 And Peter said to Him, Lord, do You speak this parable to us or also to all?
031242 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall set over his houseservants, to give them their portion of food in season?
031243 Blessed is that servant when his lord comes and finds him so doing.
031244 Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.
031245 But if that servant says in his heart, My lord delays his coming, and shall begin to beat the male servants and women servants, and to eat and drink and to be drunk,
031246 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he does not expect, and at an hour when he does not know. And he will cut him apart, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.
031247 And that servant who knew his lord's will and did not prepare, nor did according to His will, shall be beaten with many stripes .
031248 But he not knowing, and doing things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes . For to whomever much is given, of him much shall be required. And to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
031249 I have come to send fire on the earth. And what will I do if it is already kindled?
031250 But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed down until it is accomplished!
031251 Do you suppose that I have come to give peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.
031252 For from now on, there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
031253 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
031254 And He also said to the crowd, When you see a cloud rise out of the west, immediately you say, There is a shower coming. And so it is.
031255 And when you see the south wind blow, you say, There will be heat; and it occurs.
031256 Hypocrites! You know to discern the face of the heaven and the earth, but how is it that you do not discern this time?
031257 And why, even of yourselves, do you not judge what is right?
031258 For as you go with your adversary to the judge, give pains in the way to be set free from him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into the prison.
031259 I tell you, you shall not depart from there until you have paid the very last lepton.
031301 And some were present at the same time reporting to Him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
031302 And answering, Jesus said to them, Do you suppose that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered such things?
031303 I tell you, No. But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
031304 Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were sinners above all men who lived in Jerusalem?
031305 I tell you, No. But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
031306 He also spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard. And he came and sought fruit on it, and found none.
031307 And he said to the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none. Cut it down, why does it encumber the ground?
031308 And answering, he said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and throw manure.
031309 And if it bears fruit, well ; and if not, then after that you shall cut it down.
031310 And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
031311 And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bowed together and was not able to be completely erect.
031312 And when Jesus saw her, He called and said to her, Woman, you are delivered from your infirmity.
031313 And He laid His hands on her. And instantly she was made erect, and she glorified God.
031314 And answering, the synagogue ruler, being angry because Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, said to the crowd, There are six days in which it is right to work. Therefore in them come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
031315 And the Lord answered him and said, Hypocrite! Does not each one of you on the sabbath loosen his ox or ass from the stall and lead it away, to give it drink?
031316 And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound, lo these eighteen years, be loosened from this bond on the Sabbath day?
031317 And when He had said these things, all His adversaries were ashamed. And all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.
031318 And He said, What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?
031319 It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and threw into his garden. And it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in its branches.
031320 And again He said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
031321 It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.
031322 And He went through the cities and villages, teaching and progressing toward Jerusalem.
031323 And one said to Him, Lord, are the ones being saved few? And He said to them,
031324 Strive to enter in at the narrow gate. For I say to you, many will seek to enter in and shall not be able.
031325 And once the Master of the house has risen up and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, and He shall answer and say to you, I do not know you; from where are you;
031326 then you shall begin to say, We ate and drank in Your presence, and You have taught in our streets.
031327 But He shall say, I tell you, I do not know you; from where you are. Depart from Me, all workers of unrighteousness!
031328 There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrust out.
031329 And they will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline in the kingdom of God.
031330 And behold, there are last ones which will be first, and there are first ones which will be last.
031331 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to Him, Go out and depart from here, for Herod will kill you.
031332 And He said to them, You go and tell that fox, Behold, today and tomorrow, I cast out demons and I complete cures, and the third day I will be finished.
031333 Yet I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following. For it cannot be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.
031334 Jerusalem! Jerusalem! the one killing the prophets, and stoning those having been sent to her; how often I desired to gather your children in the way a hen gathers her brood under the wings, and you did not desire it .
031335 Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And truly I say to you, You will not see Me until it come when you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.
031401 And as He went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, it happened that they watched Him.
031402 And behold, a certain man was dropsical before Him.
031403 And answering, Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
031404 And they were silent. And taking him , He healed him and let him go.
031405 And He answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit and will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day?
031406 And they could not answer Him again as to these things.
031407 And He put forth a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose out the chief places, saying to them,
031408 When you are invited by anyone to a wedding, do not recline in the chief seat, lest a more honorable man than you may be invited by him.
031409 And he who invited you and him shall come and say to you, Give place to this man; and then you begin with shame to take the last place.
031410 But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then glory shall be to you before those reclining with you.
031411 For whoever exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.
031412 And He also said to him who invited Him, When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends or your brothers, or your kinsmen, or your rich neighbors; lest they also invite you again, and a recompense be made to you.
031413 But when you make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,
031414 and you shall be blessed, for they cannot repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.
031415 And one of those who reclined with Him heard these things, and he said to Him, Blessed are those eating bread in the kingdom of God.
031416 And He said to him, A certain man made a great supper and invited many.
031417 And he sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.
031418 And all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, I must go and see it. I beg you, have me excused.
031419 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I beg you, have me excused.
031420 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
031421 And coming up that servant reported these things to his lord. And the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and the maimed, and the lame and the blind.
031422 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as you have commanded, and still there is room.
031423 And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.
031424 For I say to you that none of these men who were invited shall taste of my supper.
031425 And great crowds went with Him. And He turned and said to them,
031426 If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.
031427 And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me, he cannot be My disciple.
031428 For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he may have enough to finish it;
031429 lest perhaps, after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish, all those seeing begin to mock him,
031430 saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish.
031431 Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not first sit down and consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
031432 Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.
031433 So then, everyone of you who does not forsake all his possessions, he cannot be My disciple.
031434 Salt is good, but if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned?
031435 It is not fit for the land, nor for manure, but men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
031501 And all the tax-collectors and sinners drew near to Him in order to hear Him.
031502 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receives sinners and eats with them.
031503 And He spoke this parable to them, saying,
031504 What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he finds it?
031505 And when he has found it , he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
031506 And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.
031507 I say to you that likewise joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.
031508 Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma, does she not light a lamp and sweep the house, and seek carefully until she finds it ?
031509 And when she has found it , she calls her friends and her neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.
031510 Likewise I say to you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
031511 And He said, A certain man had two sons.
031512 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that is coming to me . And he divided his living to them.
031513 And not many days afterward, the younger son gathered all together and went away into a far country. And there he wasted his property, living dissolutely.
031514 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land. And he began to be in want.
031515 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
031516 And he was longing to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, and no one gave to him.
031517 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father abound in loaves, and I perish with hunger!
031518 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you
031519 and am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.
031520 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
031521 And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you, and am no more worthy to be called your son.
031522 But the father said to his servants, Bring the best robe and put it on him. And put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.
031523 And bring the fattened calf here and kill it . And let us eat and be merry,
031524 for this my son was dead and is alive again, he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.
031525 And his elder son was in the field. And as he came and drew near the house, he heard music and dancing.
031526 And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
031527 And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him safe and sound.
031528 And he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and entreated him.
031529 And answering he said to his father, Lo, these many years I have served you, neither did I transgress your commandment at any time. And yet you never gave me a kid so that I might make merry with my friends.
031530 But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed for him the fattened calf.
031531 And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.
031532 It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.
031601 And He also said to His disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward. And he was accused to him, that he had wasted his goods.
031602 And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you may no longer be steward.
031603 And the steward said within himself, What shall I do? For my lord is taking the stewardship away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.
031604 I know what I will do, so that when I am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses.
031605 So he called every one of his lord's debtors and said; to the first, How much do you owe my lord?
031606 And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.
031607 And he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred cors of wheat. And he said to him, Take your bill and write eighty.
031608 And the unjust steward's lord commended him because he had done wisely. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
031609 And I say to you, Make friends by the mammon of unrighteousness for yourselves, so that when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.
031610 He who is faithful in the least is also faithful in much. And he who is unjust in the least is also unjust in much.
031611 Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust the true riches to you?
031612 And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who shall give you that which is your own?
031613 No servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
031614 And being money-lovers, all the Pharisees also heard all these things. And they derided Him.
031615 And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
031616 The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and everyone is pressing into it.
031617 And it is easier for the heaven and earth to pass than for one tittle of the law to fail.
031618 Everyone putting away his wife and marrying another commits adultery; and everyone marrying her who is put away from her husband commits adultery.
031619 There was a certain rich man who was customarily clothed in purple and fine linen and making merry in luxury every day.
031620 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores
031621 and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. But even the dogs came and licked his sores.
031622 And it happened that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich one also died and was buried.
031623 And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
031624 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.
031625 But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things. But now he is comforted and you are tormented.
031626 And besides all this, there is a great chasm fixed between you and us; so that they desiring to pass from here to you cannot, nor can they pass over to us from there.
031627 And he said, I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house,
031628 for I have five brothers, so that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
031629 Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.
031630 And he said, No, father Abraham, but if one should go to them from the dead, they would repent.
031631 And he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded, even though one rose from the dead.
031701 And He said to the disciples, It is impossible but that offenses will come. But woe to him through whom they come!
031702 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck and he were cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.
031703 Take heed to yourselves. If your brother trespasses against you, rebuke him. And if he repents, forgive him.
031704 And if he trespasses against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turns again to you, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.
031705 And the apostles said to the Lord, Give us more faith.
031706 And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be rooted up and be planted in the sea! And it would obey you.
031707 But which of you who has a servant plowing or feeding will say to him immediately after he has come from the field, Come, recline?
031708 Will he not say to him, Prepare something so that I may eat, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink. And afterward you shall eat and drink.
031709 Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.
031710 So likewise you, when you shall have done all the things commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants, for we have done what we ought to do.
031711 And as He went to Jerusalem, it happened that he went through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
031712 And as He entered into a certain village, ten leprous men met Him, who stood afar off.
031713 And they lifted voice and said, Jesus, Master, pity us!
031714 And seeing them , He said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests. And it happened, as they went, that they were cleansed.
031715 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back and glorified God with a loud voice.
031716 And he fell down on his face at His feet, thanking Him. And he was a Samaritan.
031717 And answering, Jesus said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?
031718 Were none found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?
031719 And He said to him, Rise and go; your faith has cured you.
031720 And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation.
031721 Nor shall they say, Lo here! or, behold, there! For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.
031722 And He said to the disciples, The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it .
031723 And they shall say to you, Lo, here! or, behold, there! Do not go away, nor follow.
031724 For as the lightning which lights up, flashing from the one part under heaven, and shines to the other part under heaven, so also shall the Son of man be in His day.
031725 But first He must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.
031726 And as it was in the days of Noah, so it also shall be in the days of the Son of man.
031727 They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and the flood came and destroyed them all.
031728 So also as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
031729 but the day Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from the heaven and destroyed them all.
031730 Even so it shall be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
031731 In that day he who shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise, he who is in the field, let him not return to the things behind.
031732 Remember Lot's wife.
031733 Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it, and whoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
031734 I tell you, in that night there shall be two in one bed, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
031735 Two shall be grinding together, one will be taken, and the other left.
031736 Two shall be in the field, one will be taken, and the other left.
031737 And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Wherever the body is , there the eagles will be gathered together.
031801 And He also spoke a parable to them to teach it is always right to pray, and not to faint,
031802 saying, A certain judge was in a certain city, not fearing God, nor respecting man.
031803 And a widow was in that city. And she came to Him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.
031804 And he would not do so for a time. But afterward he said within himself, Though I do not fear God nor regard man,
031805 yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, that she not wear me down in the end.
031806 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.
031807 And shall not God avenge His own elect who cry day and night to Him, though He has been long-suffering over them?
031808 I say to you that He will avenge them speedily. Yet when the Son of man comes, shall He find faith on the earth?
031809 And He spoke this parable to certain ones who trusted in themselves, that they were righteous, and despised others:
031810 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-collector.
031811 The Pharisee stood and prayed within himself in this way: God, I thank You that I am not as other men are , extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax-collector.
031812 I fast twice on the Sabbath, I give tithes of all that I possess.
031813 And standing afar off, the tax-collector would not even lift up his eyes to Heaven, but struck on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner!
031814 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.
031815 And they also brought infants to Him, that He might touch them. But when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.
031816 But Jesus called them and said, Allow the little children to come to Me, and forbid them not. For of such is the kingdom of God.
031817 Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no way enter into it.
031818 And a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
031819 And Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? None is good except One, God.
031820 You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother.
031821 And he said, I have kept all these from my youth up.
031822 And when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, Yet you lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come, follow Me.
031823 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful, for he was very rich.
031824 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, He said, How hardly those having riches shall enter into the kingdom of God!
031825 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich one to enter into the kingdom of God.
031826 And the ones who heard said, And who can be saved?
031827 And He said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
031828 And Peter said, Lo, we have left all and have followed You.
031829 And He said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no one who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,
031830 who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and, in the world to come everlasting life.
031831 And He took the Twelve and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man will be accomplished.
031832 For He will be delivered to the nations and will be mocked and insulted and spat on.
031833 And they will scourge Him and put Him to death, and the third day He will rise again.
031834 And they did not understand any of these things. And this saying was hidden from them, nor did they know the things which were spoken.
031835 And as He came near Jericho, it happened that a certain blind man sat by the roadside begging.
031836 And hearing the crowd pass by, he asked what it meant.
031837 And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passed by.
031838 And he cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David! Have mercy on me.
031839 And they who were in front rebuked him that he should be quiet. But he cried so much the more, Son of David! Have mercy on me.
031840 And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him,
031841 saying, What do you desire that I should do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
031842 And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight! Your faith has saved you.
031843 And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And when they saw, all the people gave praise to God.
031901 And going in, He passed through Jericho.
031902 And behold, there was a man named Zaccheus, who was a chief tax-collector. And he was rich.
031903 And he sought to see Jesus, to see who He was. And he could not because of the press, because he was little in stature.
031904 And he ran in front and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him. For He was to pass through that way .
031905 And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him. And He said to him, Zaccheus! Hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.
031906 And hurrying he came down, and received Him joyfully.
031907 And seeing, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to stay with a sinful man.
031908 And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor. And in anything I accused anyone falsely, I restore it fourfold.
031909 And Jesus said to him, This day salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.
031910 For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.
031911 And as they heard these things, He added and spoke a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was about to appear immediately.
031912 Therefore He said, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom for himself, and to return.
031913 And He called his ten servants and delivered ten minas, and said to them, Trade until I come back.
031914 But his citizens hated him. And they sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this one to reign over us.
031915 And when he had received his kingdom and had returned, then it happened that he commanded these servants to be called to him; the ones to whom he had given the silver; so that he might know what each had gained by trading.
031916 And came the first, saying, Lord, your mina has gained ten minas.
031917 And he said to him, Well done , good servant, because you have been faithful in a least thing, have authority over ten cities.
031918 And the second came, saying, Lord, your mina has made five minas.
031919 And he said the same to him, You be over five cities.
031920 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your mina, which I have kept in a handkerchief.
031921 For I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.
031922 And he said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, wicked servant! You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I had not laid down and reaping what I did not sow.
031923 And why did you not give my silver on the bank table, and coming I might have exacted it with interest?
031924 And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him and give it to him who has ten minas.
031925 And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.
031926 For I say to you that to everyone who has, more will be given. And from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken from him.
031927 But those who are my enemies, who did not desire that I should reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.
031928 And saying these things, He went in front, going up to Jerusalem.
031929 And it happened as He drew near Bethphage and Bethany, toward the mount called Mount of Olives, He sent two of the disciples,
031930 saying, Go into the village across from you , and having entered, you will find a colt tied up, on which no one of men has yet sat. Untie it and bring it .
031931 And if anyone asks you, Why are you untying it ? You will say this to him, Because the Lord has need of it.
031932 And going, those who were sent found as He had said to them.
031933 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt?
031934 And they said, The Lord has need of him.
031935 And they brought him to Jesus. And they threw their garments on the colt. And they set Jesus on it .
031936 And as He went, they spread their clothes in the way.
031937 And when He had come near, even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,
031938 saying, Blessed is the King coming in the name of the Lord! Peace in Heaven and glory in the highest!
031939 And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.
031940 And He answered and said to them, I tell you that if these should be silent, the stones would cry out.
031941 And as He drew near, He beheld the city and wept over it,
031942 saying, If you had known, even you, even at least in this day of yours, the things for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.
031943 For the days will come on you that your enemies will raise up a rampart to you, and will surround you, and will keep you in on every side.
031944 And they will tear you down, and your children within you, and will not leave a stone on a stone because you did not know the time of your visitation.
031945 And entering into the temple, He began to cast out those selling and buying in it,
031946 saying to them, It is written, "My house is a house of prayer," but you have made it a den of thieves.
031947 And He taught in the temple daily. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy Him.
031948 And they could not find what they might do, for all the people were hanging on Him, listening.
032001 And on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and proclaimed the gospel, it happened that the chief priests and the scribes along with the elders came on Him .
032002 And they spoke to Him, saying, Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who is he who gave you this authority?
032003 And He answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing, and you answer me:
032004 The baptism of John, was it from Heaven or from men?
032005 And they reasoned within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him?
032006 But if we say, From men, then all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
032007 And they answered that they could not tell from where it was .
032008 And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
032009 And He began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to vinedressers. And he went into a far country for a long time.
032010 And in season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, so that they should give him the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty.
032011 And again he sent another servant. And they also beat him and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
032012 And again he sent a third. And they also wounded him and cast him out.
032013 And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that they will respect him when they see him.
032014 But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir! Come, let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.
032015 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What then shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?
032016 He shall come and destroy these vinedressers and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this, they said, Let it not be!
032017 And He looked at them and said, What then is this which is written, " The Stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the Head of the corner?
032018 Whoever shall fall on that Stone shall be broken, but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
032019 And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him the same hour. And they feared the people, for they perceived that He had spoken this parable against them.
032020 And they watched and sent forth spies, pretending themselves to be righteous men, so that they might seize upon a word of His, that they might deliver Him in this way to the power and authority of the governor.
032021 And they asked Him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and do not accept the person of anyone, but truly teach the way of God.
032022 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?
032023 But He perceived their craftiness and said to them, Why do you tempt Me?
032024 Show Me a coin. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesar's.
032025 And He said to them, Therefore render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.
032026 And they could not take hold of His words before the people. And they marveled at His answer and were silent.
032027 And certain of the Sadducees came, those speaking against a resurrection, that it was not to be. And they asked Him,
032028 saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If anyone's brother dies, having a wife, and if he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.
032029 Therefore there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife and died without children.
032030 And the second took her as a wife, and he died childless.
032031 And the third took her. And likewise the seven left no children and died.
032032 Last of all the woman also died.
032033 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be? For the seven had her as a wife.
032034 And answering, Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage,
032035 but they who shall be counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.
032036 Nor can they die any more, for they are equal to the angels, and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.
032037 But that the dead are raised, even Moses pointed out at the Bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
032038 For He is not God of the dead, but of the living. For all live to Him.
032039 And answering, certain of the scribes said, Teacher, you have spoken well.
032040 And after that they did not dare ask Him anything.
032041 And He said to them, How do they say that Christ is the Son of David?
032042 Even David himself says in the Book of Psalms, "The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand
032043 until I place Your enemies as Your footstool."
032044 David then calls Him Lord; how then is He his son?
032045 And as all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,
032046 Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at the feasts;
032047 who devour widows' houses, and make long prayers for a show; the same shall receive a more severe condemnation.
032101 And looking up, He saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
032102 And He also saw a certain poor widow casting two lepta in there.
032103 And He said, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has cast in more than all of them.
032104 For all these have cast in to the offerings of God from their abundance, but out of her poverty she has cast in all the living she had.
032105 And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, He said,
032106 As to these things which you see, days will come in which there shall not be left a stone on a stone, which shall not be thrown down.
032107 And they asked Him, saying, Teacher, but when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign when these things are about to take place?
032108 And He said, Take heed that you are not deceived, for many shall come in My name, saying, I AM! Also, The time has come! Do not go after them.
032109 But when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for all these things must first occur, but the end is not at once.
032110 And He said to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
032111 And great earthquakes shall be in different places, and famines and plagues. And there shall be terrors and great signs from Heaven.
032112 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for My name's sake.
032113 And it shall return to you for a testimony.
032114 Therefore settle it in your hearts not to meditate beforehand what you shall answer.
032115 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
032116 And you shall be betrayed also by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends. And they will cause some of you to be put to death.
032117 And you shall be hated by all for My name's sake.
032118 But there shall not a hair of your head perish.
032119 By your patience you will gain your souls.
032120 And when you see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that its destruction has come.
032121 And let those in Judea flee to the mountains. And those in its midst, let them go out. And those in the open spaces, let them not go into her.
032122 For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
032123 But woe to those who are with child, and to those suckling in those days! For there shall be great distress in the land and wrath on this people.
032124 And they shall fall by the sword's edge. And shall be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the nations until the times of the nations is fulfilled.
032125 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars. And on the earth will be anxiety of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
032126 men fainting from fear, and expecting those things which have come on the earth. For the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
032127 And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
032128 And when these things begin to happen, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws near.
032129 And He spoke a parable to them: Behold the fig-tree and all the trees.
032130 Now when they sprout leaves, seeing it you will know that summer is now near.
032131 So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.
032132 Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass away until all these things are fulfilled.
032133 The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.
032134 And take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts are weighed down with headaches and drinking and anxieties of this life; and that day should suddenly come on you;
032135 for it shall come as a snare on all those sitting on the face of the whole earth.
032136 Watch therefore, praying in every season that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things which shall occur, and to stand before the Son of man.
032137 And in the days He was teaching in the temple. And in the nights He went out, and lodged in the mount called the Mount of Olives.
032138 And all the people came early in the morning to Him in the temple, in order to hear Him.
032201 And the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.
032202 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill Him, for they feared the people.
032203 And Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the Twelve.
032204 And going, he talked with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray Him to them.
032205 And they were glad and they agreed to give him silver.
032206 And he fully consented, and he sought opportunity to betray Him to them, away from the crowd.
032207 And the day of the Unleavened Bread came, when the passover must be killed.
032208 And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, so that we may eat.
032209 And they said to Him. Where do You desire that we prepare?
032210 And He said to them, Behold, when you have entered into the city, you will meet a man bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house where he enters.
032211 And you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I shall eat the passover with My disciples?
032212 And he shall show you a large, furnished upper room. Prepare there.
032213 And they went and found it as He had said to them. And they prepared the passover.
032214 And when the hour came, He and the twelve apostles with Him reclined.
032215 And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.
032216 For I say to you, I will not any more eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
032217 And He took the cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.
032218 For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come.
032219 And He took bread and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you, this do in remembrance of Me.
032220 In the same way He took the cup, after having dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is being poured out for you.
032221 But, behold, the hand of My betrayer is with Me on the table.
032222 And truly the Son of man goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!
032223 And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing.
032224 And there was also a dispute among them as to which of them seems to be greater.
032225 And He said to them, The kings of the nations exercise lordship over them. And they who exercise authority on them are called benefactors.
032226 But you shall not be so: but the greater among you, let him be as the lesser, and he who governs, as one who serves.
032227 For which is the greater; he who reclines, or he who serves? Is it not he who reclines? But I am among you as He who serves.
032228 You are those who have continued with Me in My trials.
032229 And I appoint a kingdom to you, as My Father has appointed to Me,
032230 that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
032231 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired you, that he may sift you as wheat.
032232 But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not. And when you are converted, strengthen your brothers.
032233 And he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You, both into prison and into death.
032234 And He said, I say to you, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before you shall deny knowing Me three times.
032235 And He said to them, When I sent you without purse and wallet and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing.
032236 And He said to them, But now, he who has a purse, let him take it , and likewise his wallet. And he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.
032237 For I say to you that this which is written must yet be accomplished in Me, "And he was reckoned among the transgressors"; for the things concerning Me have an end.
032238 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.
032239 And going out, according to His custom, He went to the Mount of Olives. And His disciples also followed Him.
032240 And when He was at the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.
032241 And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw. And He kneeled down and prayed,
032242 saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.
032243 And an angel appeared to Him from Heaven, strengthening Him.
032244 And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly. And His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
032245 And when He rose up from prayer and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping because of sorrow.
032246 And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Rise and pray lest you enter into temptation.
032247 And as He was yet speaking, behold a crowd! And he who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, went before them. And he drew near Jesus to kiss Him.
032248 But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?
032249 And those around Him seeing what was about to occur, they said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
032250 And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
032251 And Jesus answered and said, Let it go until now. And touching his ear, He healed him.
032252 And Jesus said to the chief priests and commanders of the temple, and the elders, who had come to Him, Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and staves?
032253 When I was with you in the temple daily, you did not stretch out your hand on Me. But this is your hour, and the authority of the darkness.
032254 And laying hold on Him, they led Him away and brought Him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.
032255 And lighting a fire in the middle of the court, and they sitting down, Peter sat in their midst.
032256 But a certain slave-girl saw him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked on him and said, This man was with him also.
032257 And he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.
032258 And after a little while another saw him and said, You also are of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not!
032259 And about an hour afterward, another confidently affirmed, saying, Truly this one was also with him, for he is a Galilean.
032260 And Peter said, Man, I do not know what you say. And immediately, while he still spoke, the cock crowed.
032261 And the Lord turned and looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times.
032262 And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
032263 And the men who held Jesus mocked Him, beating Him .
032264 And blindfolding Him, they struck Him on His face. And they asked Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is it who struck you?
032265 And they spoke many other things blasphemously against Him.
032266 And when day came, the body of elders of the people, and the chief priests and the scribes, came together. And they led Him to the sanhedrin, saying,
032267 Are you the Christ? Tell us. And He said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe.
032268 Also if I ask you , you will not answer Me nor let Me go.
032269 From now on the Son of man shall sit at the right hand of the power of God.
032270 And they all said, Are you then the Son of God? And He said to them, You say it , because I AM!
032271 And they said, What need do we have for any witness? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.
032301 And rising up, all the multitude of them led Him before Pilate.
032302 And they began to accuse Him, saying, We have found this one perverting the nation and forbidding them to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be a king, Christ.
032303 And Pilate asked Him, saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And He answered him and said, You say it .
032304 And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.
032305 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
032306 And hearing Galilee, Pilate asked if the man is a Galilean.
032307 And knowing that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time.
032308 And seeing Jesus, Herod greatly rejoiced, for he had desired to see Him for a long time , because he had heard many things about Him. And he hoped to see some miracle done by Him.
032309 And he questioned Him in many words, but He answered him nothing.
032310 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.
032311 And humiliating Him with his guardsmen, and mocking Him by putting luxurious clothing around Him, Herod sent Him again to Pilate.
032312 And that same day Pilate and Herod became friends with one another, for before they were at enmity between themselves.
032313 And when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
032314 Pilate said to them, You have brought this Man to me as perverting the people. And behold, having examined Him before you, I have found no fault in this Man regarding those things of which you accuse Him;
032315 no, nor even Herod, for I sent you to him, and lo, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.
032316 Therefore I will chastise Him and release Him .
032317 (For it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast.)
032318 And they all cried out at once, saying, Away with this One! And release to us Barabbas
032319 (who was thrown into prison because of a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder).
032320 And Pilate, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.
032321 But they cried, saying, Crucify! Crucify Him!
032322 And he said to them the third time , Why? What evil has He done? I have found no cause of death in Him, therefore I will chastise Him and let Him go.
032323 But they pressed on him , with loud voices, requesting that He might be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.
032324 And Pilate gave judgment that their request should be granted.
032325 And he released to them the one who had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder, for whom they had asked. But he delivered up Jesus to their will.
032326 And as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country. And they laid the cross on him, that he might carry it after Jesus.
032327 And a great multitude of people were following Him, and of women who also were bewailing and lamenting Him.
032328 But turning to them, Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
032329 For behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which did not suckle.
032330 And they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! And to the hills, Cover us!
032331 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
032332 And two others, two criminals, were led with Him to be put to death.
032333 And when they came to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified Him and the criminals there, one on the right, and one on the left.
032334 And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do. And parting His clothing, they cast lots.
032335 And the people stood watching. And also the rulers with them, scoffing, saying, He saved others, let Him save Himself, if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.
032336 And coming near, the soldiers also mocked Him, and offering Him sour wine,
032337 and saying, If You are the king of the Jews, save Yourself.
032338 And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
032339 And one of the hanged criminals blasphemed Him, saying, If you are Christ, save Yourself and us.
032340 But answering, the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, since you are in the same condemnation.
032341 And we indeed justly so, for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this Man has done nothing amiss.
032342 And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.
032343 And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.
032344 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
032345 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the middle.
032346 And crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. And when He had said this, He breathed out the spirit.
032347 And when the centurion saw what had been done, he glorified God, saying, Truly this Man was righteous.
032348 And all the crowd arriving together at this sight, beholding the things happening, struck their breasts and returned.
032349 And all those known to Him stood at a distance; and the women, those accompanying Him from Galilee, were seeing these things.
032350 And behold, a man named Joseph, a councillor, a good man and a just one,
032351 this one was not assenting to their counsel and deed. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews; and he also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
032352 This man went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.
032353 And he took it down and wrapped it in linen. And he laid it in a tomb that had been cut in the stone, in which no man had before been laid.
032354 And that day was the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
032355 And also women were following, who were accompanying Him out of Galilee, who watched the tomb, and how His body was placed.
032356 And they returned and they prepared spices and ointment. And they rested on the sabbath day according to the commandment.
032401 And on the first of the sabbaths, while still very early, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
032402 But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
032403 And going in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
032404 And as they were much perplexed about it, it happened that, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.
032405 And as they were afraid, and bowed their faces down to the earth, they said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?
032406 He is not here, but has risen. Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,
032407 saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again?
032408 And they remembered His words
032409 and returned from the tomb and told all these things to the Eleven and to the rest.
032410 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.
032411 And their words seemed to them like foolishness, and they did not believe them.
032412 And Peter arose and ran to the tomb, and stooping down he saw the linens lying alone. And he went away wondering to himself at what had happened.
032413 And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, it being about sixty stadia from Jerusalem.
032414 And they talked to each other of all these things which had happened.
032415 And while they talked and reasoned, it happened that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.
032416 But their eyes were held so that they could not know Him.
032417 And He said to them, What words are these that you have with one another as you walk, and are so sad?
032418 And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to Him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem and have not known the things which have occurred there in these days?
032419 And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a man, a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
032420 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the judgment of death, and have crucified Him.
032421 But we had trusted that He was the One who was about to redeem Israel. And besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done.
032422 Yes, and also some of our women astounded us, having been early at the tomb;
032423 and when they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that He was alive.
032424 And some of those with us went to the tomb and found it even as the women had said. But they did not see Him.
032425 And He said to them, O fools and slow of heart to believe all things that the prophets spoke!
032426 Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?
032427 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.
032428 And they drew near the village where they were going. And He appeared to be going further.
032429 But they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is far spent. And He went in to stay with them.
032430 And it happened as He reclined with them, taking the loaf, He blessed it , and breaking it, He gave to them.
032431 And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him. And He became invisible to them.
032432 And they said to one another, Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us by the way and while He opened the Scriptures to us?
032433 And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found assembled the Eleven and those with them.
032434 And they said, the Lord has indeed risen, and has appeared to Simon.
032435 And in the way they related the things happening, and how He had been known by them in breaking of the loaf.
032436 And as they spoke this, Jesus Himself stood in their midst, and said to them, Peace to you!
032437 But they were terrified and filled with fear, for they thought they saw a spirit.
032438 And He said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
032439 Behold My hands and My feet, that I am He! Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see Me have.
032440 And when He had spoken this, He showed them His hands and feet.
032441 And while they still did not believe for joy, and wondered, He said to them, Have you any food here?
032442 And they handed to Him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb.
032443 And He took it and ate before them.
032444 And He said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and in the Psalms about Me.
032445 And He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.
032446 And He said to them, So it is written, and so it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
032447 and that repentance and remission of sins should be proclaimed in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
032448 And you are witnesses of these things.
032449 And behold, I send the promise of My father on you. But you sit in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.
032450 And He led them out as far as Bethany. And lifting up His hands, He blessed them.
032451 And it happened as He blessed them, He withdrew from them and was carried up into Heaven.
032452 And worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
032453 And they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
040101 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
040102 He was in the beginning with God.
040103 All things came into being through Him, and without Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being.
040104 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
040105 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.
040106 There was a man sent from God; his name was John.
040107 This one came as a witness, to bear witness concerning the Light, so that all might believe through him.
040108 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
040109 He was the true Light; He enlightens every man coming into the world.
040110 He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, and the world did not know Him.
040111 He came to His own, and His own received Him not.
040112 But as many as received Him, He gave to them authority to become the children of God, to those who believe on His name,
040113 who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but were born of God.
040114 And the Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us. And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and of truth.
040115 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, This was He of whom I spoke: He who comes after me has been before me, for He was preceding me.
040116 And out of His fullness we all have received, and grace for grace.
040117 For the law came through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
040118 No one has seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him .
040119 And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?
040120 And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ.
040121 And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.
040122 Then they said to him, Who are you so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say of yourself?
040123 He said, I am "the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord," as the prophet Isaiah said.
040124 And they who were sent were from the Pharisees.
040125 And they asked him and said, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor that Prophet?
040126 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but One stands among you whom you do not know.
040127 He it is who, coming after me, who has been before me; of whom I am not worthy to loosen the thong of His sandal.
040128 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
040129 The next day John sees Jesus coming to him and says, Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
040130 This is He of whom I said, After me comes a Man who has been before me, for He preceded me.
040131 And I did not know Him, but that He be revealed to Israel, therefore I have come baptizing with water.
040132 And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove, and He abode on Him.
040133 And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water, that One said to me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon Him, He is the One who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.
040134 And I saw and bore record that this is the Son of God.
040135 Again, the next day afterward, John stood with two of his disciples.
040136 And looking upon Jesus as He walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God!
040137 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
040138 Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, What do you seek? They said to Him, Rabbi (which is called, being translated, Teacher), where do you live?
040139 He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where He lived, and stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
040140 One of the two who heard John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
040141 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being translated, the Christ).
040142 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus saw him, He said, You are Simon the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which translated is, A stone).
040143 The day after, Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee. And He found Philip and said to him, Follow Me.
040144 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
040145 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses wrote in the law and the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
040146 And Nathanael said to him, Can there be any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.
040147 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile!
040148 Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.
040149 Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel!
040150 Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.
040151 And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see Heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
040201 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. And the mother of Jesus was there.
040202 And Jesus and His disciples were both invited to the marriage.
040203 And when they lacked wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.
040204 Jesus said to her, Woman, what do I have to do with you? My hour has not yet come.
040205 His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do it .
040206 And there were six stone waterpots there, according to the purification of the Jews, each containing two or three measures.
040207 Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
040208 And He said to them, Now draw out and carry it to the master of the feast. And they carried it .
040209 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine (and did not know where it was from, but the servants who drew the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.
040210 And he said to him, Every man at the beginning sets forth good wine, and when men have drunk well, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now.
040211 This beginning of miracles Jesus did in Cana of Galilee. And it revealed His glory. And His disciples believed on Him.
040212 After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples. And they did not stay there many days.
040213 And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
040214 And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.
040215 And when He had made a scourge of small cords, He drove them all out of the temple, also the sheep and the oxen. And He poured out the money-changers' money and overthrew the tables.
040216 And He said to those who sold doves, Take these things away from here. Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise.
040217 And His disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of Your house has eaten Me up."
040218 Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do you show us, since you do these things?
040219 Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.
040220 Then the Jews said, This temple was forty-six years building, and will you rear it up in three days?
040221 But He spoke of the temple of His body.
040222 Therefore when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.
040223 And as He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the miracles which He did.
040224 But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all
040225 and did not need that anyone should testify of man. For He knew what was in man.
040301 And there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
040302 He came to Jesus by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no man can do these miracles which you do unless God is with him.
040303 Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
040304 Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?
040305 Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
040306 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
040307 Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again.
040308 The Spirit breathes where He desires, and you hear His voice, but you do not know from where He comes, and where He goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.
040309 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?
040310 Jesus answered and said to him, Are you the teacher of Israel and do not know these things?
040311 Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak what we know and testify what we have seen. And you do not receive our witness.
040312 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how shall you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
040313 And no one has ascended up to Heaven except He who came down from Heaven, the Son of man who is in Heaven.
040314 But even as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,
040315 so that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
040316 For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
040317 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.
040318 He who believes on Him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
040319 And this is the condemnation, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the Light, because their deeds were evil.
040320 For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, lest his deeds should be exposed.
040321 But he who practices truth comes to the Light so that his works may be revealed, that they exist, having been worked in God.
040322 After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea. And He stayed there with them and baptized.
040323 And John was also baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized.
040324 For John had not yet been cast into prison.
040325 Then a question from John's disciples arose with the Jews about purification.
040326 And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, He baptizes, and all come to Him!
040327 And John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from Heaven.
040328 You yourselves bear witness to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him.
040329 He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Then my joy is fulfilled.
040330 He must increase, but I must decrease.
040331 He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is earthly and speaks from the earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all,
040332 and what He has seen and heard, that He testifies, and no one receives His testimony.
040333 He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.
040334 For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.
040335 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.
040336 He who believes on the Son has everlasting life, and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.
040401 Therefore when the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John
040402 (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples),
040403 He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.
040404 And it was necessary for Him to go through Samaria,
040405 Then He came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
040406 And Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, being wearied with His journey, sat thus upon the well. It was about the sixth hour.
040407 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.
040408 (For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.)
040409 Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, How do you, being a Jew, ask a drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews do not associate with Samaritans.
040410 Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me to drink, you would have asked of Him, and He would have given you living water.
040411 The woman said to Him, Sir, you have no vessel, and the well is deep. From where then do you have that living water?
040412 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children and his cattle?
040413 Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again,
040414 but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
040415 The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.
040416 Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.
040417 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband
040418 for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband. In that you spoke truly.
040419 The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
040420 Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
040421 Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you shall neither worship the Father in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem.
040422 You worship what you do not know, we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.
040423 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to worship Him.
040424 God is a spirit, and they who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.
040425 The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. When He has come, He will tell us all things.
040426 Jesus said to her, I AM, the One speaking to you.
040427 And upon this His disciples came and marveled that He talked with the woman. However, no one said, What do You seek, or why do You talk with her?
040428 The woman then left her waterpot and went into the city and said to the men,
040429 Come see a man who told me all things that I ever did. Is this One not the Christ?
040430 And they went out of the city and came to Him.
040431 In the meantime His disciples were asking Him, saying, Master, eat.
040432 But He said to them, I have food to eat which you do not know.
040433 Therefore the disciples said to one another, No one brought Him anything to eat?
040434 Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.
040435 Do you not say, It is yet four months, and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white to harvest already.
040436 And he who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to life eternal, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
040437 And in this is the saying true, One sows and another reaps.
040438 I sent you to reap that on which you bestowed no labor. Other men labored, and you have entered into their labor.
040439 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed upon Him because of the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that I ever did.
040440 Then as the Samaritans had come to Him, they begged Him that He would stay with them. And He stayed there two days.
040441 And many more believed because of His own word.
040442 And they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying, for we have heard Him ourselves and know that this is truly the Christ, the Savior of the world.
040443 And after two days He departed from there and went into Galilee.
040444 For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own native-place.
040445 Then when He had come into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.
040446 Then Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where He made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
040447 When He heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and begged Him that He would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
040448 Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.
040449 The nobleman said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies.
040450 Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went away.
040451 And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him , saying, Your son lives.
040452 Then he asked of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
040453 So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself believed, and his whole house.
040454 This is the second miracle Jesus did, when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.
040501 After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
040502 Now there is a pool at the Sheep Gate at Jerusalem, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.
040503 In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, of blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
040504 For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and troubled the water. Then whoever first stepped in after the troubling of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.
040505 And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.
040506 When Jesus saw him lying, and knowing that he had spent much time, He said to him, Do you desire to be made whole?
040507 The infirm man answered Him, Sir, when the water is troubled, I have no one to put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another steps down before me.
040508 Jesus says to him, Rise, take up your bed and walk.
040509 And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked. And it was a sabbath on that day.
040510 Therefore the Jews said to him who had been healed, It is the sabbath. It is not lawful for you to take up the bed.
040511 He answered them, He who made me whole said to me, Take up your bed and walk.
040512 Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk?
040513 And he did not know Him who had cured him, for Jesus had moved away, a crowd being in the place.
040514 Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you are made whole. Sin no more lest a worse thing come to you.
040515 The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.
040516 And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the sabbath day.
040517 But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.
040518 Then, because of this, the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He not only had broken the sabbath, but also said that God was His father, making Himself equal with God.
040519 Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself but what He sees the Father do. For whatever things He does, these also the Son does likewise.
040520 For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all the things that He Himself does. And He will show Him greater works than these, so that you may marvel.
040521 For as the Father raises the dead and makes alive, even so the Son of man makes alive whomever He wills.
040522 For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son,
040523 so that all should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
040524 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes on Him who sent Me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death to life.
040525 Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they who hear shall live.
040526 For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has given to the Son to have life within Himself,
040527 and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.
040528 Do not marvel at this, for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves shall hear His voice,
040529 and shall come forth, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced evil to the resurrection of condemnation.
040530 I can do nothing of My own self. As I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of the Father who has sent Me.
040531 If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true.
040532 There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true.
040533 You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.
040534 But I do not receive testimony from man, but these things I say so that you might be saved.
040535 He was a burning and shining light, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.
040536 But I have greater witness than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me that I should finish them, the works which I do themselves witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.
040537 And He sending Me, the Father Himself, has borne witness of Me. Neither have you heard His voice at any time nor seen His shape.
040538 And you do not have His Word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He has sent.
040539 You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life. And they are the ones witnessing of Me,
040540 and you will not come to Me that you might have life.
040541 I do not receive honor from men.
040542 But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.
040543 I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me. If another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.
040544 How can you believe, you who receive honor from one another and do not seek the honor that comes from God only?
040545 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.
040546 For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me.
040547 But if you do not believe his writings, how shall you believe My words?
040601 After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, the Sea of Tiberias.
040602 And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His miracles which He did on the sick ones.
040603 And Jesus went up into a mountain and sat there with His disciples.
040604 And the Passover was near, a feast of the Jews.
040605 Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and saw a great crowd come to Him. He said to Philip, Where shall we buy loaves so that these may eat?
040606 And He said this to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.
040607 Philip answered Him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not enough for them, that every one may take a little.
040608 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,
040609 There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are these among so many?
040610 And Jesus said, Make the men recline. And there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number.
040611 And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who had reclined; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted.
040612 And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments left over, so that nothing is lost.
040613 Therefore they gathered and filled twelve handbaskets with fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over to those who had eaten.
040614 Then seeing the miracle that Jesus did, those men said, This is truly the Prophet, the One coming into the world.
040615 Therefore when Jesus perceived that they would come and take Him by force, that they might make Him a king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain alone by Himself.
040616 And when evening had come, the disciples went down to the sea
040617 and entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
040618 And the sea rose up because of a great wind that blew.
040619 Then having rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the ship. And they were afraid.
040620 But He said to them, I AM! Do not be afraid.
040621 Then they willingly received Him into the boat. And immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
040622 The following day, the crowd standing on the other side of the sea had seen that there was no other little boat there except that one into which His disciples had entered, and when they saw that Jesus did not go with His disciples into the little boat, but that His disciples had gone away alone,
040623 (however, other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the loaves, the Lord having given thanks),
040624 therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves also entered into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.
040625 And when they had found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did you come here?
040626 Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you saw the miracles, but because you ate the loaves and were filled.
040627 Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for that food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you. For God the Father sealed Him.
040628 Then they said to Him, What shall we do that we might work the works of God?
040629 Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe on Him whom He has sent.
040630 Therefore they said to Him, What sign do you show then, so that we may see and believe you? What do you work?
040631 Our fathers ate the manna in the desert, as it is written, "He gave them bread from Heaven to eat."
040632 Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you that bread from Heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread from Heaven.
040633 For the bread of God is He who comes down from Heaven and gives life to the world.
040634 Then they said to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
040635 And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes on Me shall never thirst.
040636 But I said to you that you also have seen Me and do not believe.
040637 All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will in no way cast out.
040638 For I came down from Heaven, not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.
040639 And this is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day.
040640 And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes on Him should have everlasting life. And I will raise him up at the last day.
040641 Then the Jews murmured about Him, because He said, I am the bread which came down from Heaven.
040642 And they said, Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How now does this One say, I have come down from Heaven?
040643 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Do not murmur with one another.
040644 No one can come to Me unless the Father who has sent Me draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day.
040645 It is written in the prophets, "And they shall all be taught of God." Therefore everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to Me.
040646 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God, He has seen the Father.
040647 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes on Me has everlasting life.
040648 I am the Bread of life.
040649 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.
040650 This is the Bread which comes down from Heaven, so that a man may eat of it and not die.
040651 I am the Living Bread which came down from Heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he shall live forever. And truly the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
040652 Then the Jews argued with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
040653 Then Jesus says to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.
040654 Whoever partakes of My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
040655 For My flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink indeed.
040656 He who partakes of My flesh and drinks My blood dwells in Me, and I in him.
040657 As the living Father has sent Me, and I live through the Father, so he who partakes of Me, even he shall live by Me.
040658 This is the Bread which came down from Heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna, and died; he who partakes of this Bread shall live forever.
040659 He said these things in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.
040660 Then when they had heard, many of His disciples said, This is a hard saying, who can hear it?
040661 But knowing in Himself that His disciples murmured about it, Jesus said to them, Does this offend you?
040662 Then what if you should see the Son of man going up where He was before?
040663 It is the Spirit that makes alive, the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit and are life.
040664 But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who is the one betraying Him.
040665 And He said, Because of this I said to you that no one can come to Me unless it was given to him from My Father.
040666 From this time many of His disciples went back into the things behind, and walked no more with Him.
040667 Then Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you also wish to go away?
040668 Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.
040669 And we have believed and have known that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
040670 Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? And one of you is a devil?
040671 But he spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for it was he who was about to betray Him, being one of the Twelve.
040701 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He did not desire to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
040702 And the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.
040703 Therefore His brothers said to Him, Move away from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see the works that You do.
040704 For no one does anything in secret, while he himself seeks to be in public. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.
040705 For His brothers did not believe in Him.
040706 Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
040707 The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
040708 You go up to this feast; I am not yet going up to this feast; for My time is not yet fulfilled.
040709 And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.
040710 But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret.
040711 Then the Jews sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?
040712 And there was much murmuring among the crowd concerning Him, for some said, He is a good man; others said, No, but he deceives the crowd.
040713 However, no one spoke openly of Him, because of the fear of the Jews.
040714 Now about the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
040715 And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, not being taught?
040716 Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.
040717 If anyone desires to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it is of God, or I speak from Myself.
040718 He who speaks of himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.
040719 Did not Moses give you the law? And yet not one of you keeps the law! Why do you seek to kill Me?
040720 The crowd answered and said, You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?
040721 Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.
040722 Because of this Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers,) and you circumcise a man on the sabbath day.
040723 If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath day so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry at Me because I have made a man entirely sound on the sabbath day?
040724 Do not judge according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.
040725 Then some of those from Jerusalem said, Is this not the one they seek to kill?
040726 But lo, he speaks publicly, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers truly know that this is the Christ indeed?
040727 However, we know this one, from where he is; but when Christ comes, no one knows from where He is.
040728 Then Jesus cried in the temple as He taught, saying, You both know Me, and you know from where I come. And I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.
040729 But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He has sent Me.
040730 Then they sought to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
040731 And many of the crowd believed on Him, and said, When the Christ comes, will He do more miracles than these which this One has done?
040732 The Pharisees heard that the crowd murmured such things concerning Him. And the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize Him.
040733 Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go to Him who sent Me.
040734 You shall seek Me and shall not find Me . And where I am, you cannot come.
040735 Then the Jews said among themselves, Where is he about to go that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to the Dispersion of the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?
040736 What saying is this that He said, You shall seek Me and shall not find Me , and where I am, you cannot come?
040737 And in the last day of the great feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
040738 He who believes on Me, as the Scripture has said, "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."
040739 (But He spoke this about the Spirit, which they who believed on Him should receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus was not yet glorified.)
040740 Then when they heard the Word, many of the people said, Truly this is the Prophet.
040741 Others said, This is the Christ. But others said, Does the Christ come out of Galilee?
040742 Has the Scripture not said that Christ comes from the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
040743 So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.
040744 And some of them desired to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
040745 Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, Why have you not brought him?
040746 The officers answered, Never did any man speak as does this Man.
040747 Then the Pharisees answered them, Also, have you not been deceived?
040748 Is it not true that not any of the rulers or of the Pharisees have believed into him?
040749 But this crowd, not knowing the law, is cursed.
040750 Nicodemus said to them, (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them),
040751 Does our law judge the Man before it hears Him and knows what He does?
040752 They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search the scriptures and see that a prophet has not been raised out of Galilee.
040753 And they each went to his own house.
040801 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
040802 And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him. And He sat down and taught them.
040803 And the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman taken in adultery. And standing her in the midst,
040804 they said to Him, Teacher, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
040805 Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. You, then, what do you say?
040806 They said this, tempting Him so that they might have reason to accuse Him. But bending down, Jesus wrote on the ground with His finger, not appearing to hear .
040807 But as they continued to ask Him, He lifted Himself up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.
040808 And again bending down, He wrote on the ground.
040809 And hearing, and being convicted by conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, until the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
040810 And bending back up, and seeing no one but the woman, Jesus said to her, Woman, where are the ones who accused you? Did not one give judgment against you?
040811 And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I give judgment. Go, and sin no more.
040812 Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
040813 Therefore the Pharisees said to Him, You bear record concerning yourself; your witness is not true.
040814 Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record concerning Myself, My witness is true. For I know from where I came, and where I go. But you do not know from where I came, and where I go.
040815 You judge after the flesh, I judge no one.
040816 And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.
040817 It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.
040818 I am one who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness concerning Me.
040819 Then they said to Him, Where is your father? Jesus said to them, You neither know Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.
040820 Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as He taught in the temple. And no man laid hands upon Him, for His hour had not yet come.
040821 Then Jesus said again to them, I go away, and you shall seek Me and shall die in your sins. Where I go, you cannot come.
040822 Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? Because he says, Where I go you cannot come.
040823 And He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
040824 Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins, for if you do not believe that I AM, you shall die in your sins.
040825 Then they said to Him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Even the same which I also say to you.
040826 I have many things to say and to judge of you, but He who sent Me is true, and I speak to the world those things what I heard of Him.
040827 They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.
040828 Then Jesus said to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you shall know that I AM, and that I do nothing of Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.
040829 And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things which please Him.
040830 As He spoke these words, many believed upon Him.
040831 Then Jesus said to the Jews who believed on Him, If you continue in My Word, you are My disciples indeed.
040832 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
040833 They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to anyone. How do you say, You will be made free?
040834 Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever practices sin is the slave of sin.
040835 And the slave does not abide in the house forever, but the Son abides forever.
040836 Therefore if the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
040837 I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill Me because My Word has no place in you.
040838 I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you, then, do what you have seen with your father.
040839 They answered and said to Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus answered them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.
040840 But now you seek to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I have heard beside God; this Abraham did not do.
040841 You do the deeds of your father. Then they said to Him, We are not born of fornication; we have one father, even God.
040842 Jesus said to them, If God were your father, you would love Me, for I went forth and came from God; for I did not come of Myself, but He sent Me.
040843 Why do you not know My speech? Because you cannot hear My word.
040844 You are of the Devil as father, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not abide in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.
040845 And because I tell you the truth, you do not believe Me.
040846 Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe Me?
040847 He who is of God hears God's words. Therefore you do not hear them because you are not of God.
040848 Then the Jews answered and said to Him, Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?
040849 Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.
040850 And I do not seek My own glory, but there is One who seeks and judges.
040851 Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keeps My Word, he shall never see death.
040852 Then the Jews said to Him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets are dead, and you say, If a man keeps my Word, he shall never taste of death.
040853 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets are dead; whom do you make yourself?
040854 Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.
040855 Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I should say I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I know Him and I keep His Word.
040856 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and He saw and was glad.
040857 Then the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?
040858 Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I AM!
040859 Then they took up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus hid Himself and went forth out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and passed on by.
040901 And passing by, He saw a man who was blind from birth.
040902 And His disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?
040903 Jesus answered, Neither has this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God might be revealed in him.
040904 I must work the works of Him who sent Me, while it is day. Night comes when no man can work.
040905 As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.
040906 And when He had spoken these things, He spat on the ground and made clay from the spittle. And He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.
040907 And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which translated is Sent). Therefore he went and washed and came seeing.
040908 Then the neighbors and those who had seen him before, that he was blind, said, Is this not he who was sitting and begging?
040909 Some said, This is he. Others said , He is like him. He said, I am he.
040910 Then they said to him, How were your eyes opened?
040911 He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. And going and washing, I received sight.
040912 Then they said to him, Where is he? He said, I do not know.
040913 They brought him who once was blind to the Pharisees.
040914 And it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
040915 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.
040916 Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a man, a sinner, do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
040917 They said to the blind man again, What do you say about him, for he has opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
040918 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him having received sight.
040919 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?
040920 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind.
040921 But by what means he now sees, we do not know. Or who has opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age, ask him. He will speak for himself.
040922 His parents spoke these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed that He was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
040923 Therefore his parents said, He is of age, ask him.
040924 Then a second time they called the man who was blind and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.
040925 He answered and said, Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that being blind, now I see.
040926 Then they said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?
040927 He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also desire to be His disciples?
040928 Then they reviled him and said, You are his disciple, but we are Moses' disciples.
040929 We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know from where this man is.
040930 The man answered and said to them, Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know from where He is, and He has opened my eyes.
040931 But we know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.
040932 From everlasting it was not heard that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind.
040933 If this One were not of God, He could do nothing.
040934 They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.
040935 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, He said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?
040936 And he answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him?
040937 And Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and it is He who is speaking with you.
040938 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped Him.
040939 And Jesus said, I have come into this world for judgment, that they who do not see might see, and that they who see might be made blind.
040940 And those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, Are we also blind?
040941 Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, We see. Therefore your sin remains.
041001 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter into the sheepfold by the door, but going up by another way, that one is a thief and a robber.
041002 But he who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
041003 The doorkeeper opens to him, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
041004 And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him. For they know his voice.
041005 And they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.
041006 Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what it was which He spoke to them.
041007 Then Jesus said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
041008 All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
041009 I am the door. If anyone enters in by Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture.
041010 The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come so that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
041011 I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
041012 But he who is a hireling and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away. And the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep.
041013 The hireling flees, because he is a hireling and does not care for the sheep.
041014 I am the Good Shepherd, and I know those that are Mine, and I am known by those who are Mine.
041015 Even as the Father knows Me, I also know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.
041016 And I have other sheep who are not of this fold. I must also lead those, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.
041017 Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I might take it again.
041018 No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down from Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment from My Father.
041019 Then a division occurred again among the Jews because of these words.
041020 And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you hear him?
041021 Others said, These are not words of one who has been possessed by a demon. A demon is not able to open the eyes of blind ones.
041022 And the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem, and it was winter.
041023 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's Porch.
041024 Then the Jews encircled Him and said to Him, How long do you make us doubt? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.
041025 Jesus answered them, I told you and you did not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, they bear witness of Me.
041026 But you did not believe because you are not of My sheep. As I said to you,
041027 My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.
041028 And I give to them eternal life, and they shall never ever perish, and not anyone shall pluck them out of My hand.
041029 My Father who gave them to me is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck them out of My Father's hand.
041030 I and the Father are one!
041031 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.
041032 Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from My Father; for which of these do you stone Me?
041033 The Jews answered Him, saying, We do not stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.
041034 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, "I said, You are gods?"
041035 If He called those gods with whom the Word of God was, and the Scripture cannot be broken,
041036 do you say of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?
041037 If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me.
041038 But if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.
041039 Then they again sought to seize Him, but He went forth out of their hand.
041040 And He went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John baptized at the first, and He stayed there.
041041 And many came to Him and said, John indeed did no miracle, but all things that John said concerning this One were true.
041042 And many believed on Him there.
041101 And there was a certain sick one, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
041102 (And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
041103 Then his sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.
041104 When Jesus heard, He said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God might be glorified by it.
041105 And Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
041106 Therefore, when He had heard that he was sick, then indeed He remained two days in the place where He was.
041107 Then after that He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.
041108 The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews lately have sought to stone You, and do You go there again?
041109 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world.
041110 But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles because there is no light in him.
041111 He said these things; and after that He said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps. But I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep.
041112 Then His disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps, he will get well.
041113 But Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He had spoken of taking rest in sleep.
041114 Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
041115 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.
041116 Then Thomas (he being called Twin) said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.
041117 Then when Jesus came, He found him already being held in the tomb four days.
041118 And Bethany was near Jerusalem, fifteen stadia away.
041119 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to comfort them concerning their brother.
041120 Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she met Him. But Mary was sitting in the house.
041121 Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
041122 But I know that even now, whatever You will ask of God, God will give You.
041123 Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.
041124 Martha said to Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
041125 Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection and the Life! He who believes in Me, though he die, yet he shall live.
041126 And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?
041127 She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who has come into the world.
041128 And saying these things, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher has come and calls you.
041129 As soon as she heard, she arose quickly and came to him.
041130 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.
041131 Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, they followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.
041132 Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, seeing Him, Mary fell down at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
041133 Then when He saw her weeping, and also the Jews who came with her weeping, Jesus groaned in the spirit and troubled Himself.
041134 And He said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.
041135 Jesus wept.
041136 Then the Jews said, Behold how He loved him!
041137 And some of them said, Was not this Man who opened the eyes of the blind able also to cause that even this one should not have died?
041138 Then Jesus, groaning in Himself again, came to the tomb. And it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
041139 Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who died, said to Him, Lord, by this time he stinks. For it is the fourth day .
041140 Jesus answered her, Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?
041141 Then they took away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.
041142 And I know that You hear Me always, but because of the people who stand by I said it , so that they may believe that You have sent Me.
041143 And saying these things, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, Here! Outside!
041144 And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with sheets, and his face was bound with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Untie him and let him go!
041145 Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him.
041146 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
041147 Then the chief priests and Pharisees gathered a sanhedrin, and said, What can we do? For this man does many miracles.
041148 If we let him alone this way, all will believe on him. And the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.
041149 And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest of that year, said to them, You do not know anything at all,
041150 nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish.
041151 And he did not speak this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;
041152 and not for that nation only, but also that He should gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.
041153 Then from that day they took counsel together that they might kill Him.
041154 Therefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but He went away from there to a country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and continued there with His disciples.
041155 And the Jews' Passover was near. And many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to purify themselves.
041156 Then they sought Jesus, and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple, What does it seem to you, that He will not at all come to the feast?
041157 And all the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commands, that if anyone knew where He was, he should make it known so that they might seize Him.
041201 Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was (who had died, whom He raised from the dead).
041202 Then they made a supper there for Him. And Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him.
041203 Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
041204 Then said one of His disciples (Judas Iscariot, Simon's son , who was to betray Him)
041205 Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?
041206 He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and held the moneybag and carried the things put in .
041207 Then Jesus said, Let her alone. She has kept this for the day of My burial.
041208 For you have the poor with you always; but you do not always have Me.
041209 Then a great crowd of the Jews learned that He was there. And they did not come for Jesus' sake only, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.
041210 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus to death also,
041211 because many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus because of him.
041212 On the next day, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, a great crowd who had come to the Feast
041213 took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him. And they cried, Hosanna! "Blessed is the King of Israel who comes in the name of the Lord!"
041214 And finding an ass colt, Jesus sat on it; as it is written,
041215 "Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes sitting on the foal of an ass."
041216 But His disciples did not know these things at the first. But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him.
041217 Then the crowd witnessed, those who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead.
041218 Because of this the crowd also met Him, because they heard that He had done this miracle.
041219 Then the Pharisees said among themselves, Do you see how you gain nothing? Behold, the world has gone after Him.
041220 And there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the Feast.
041221 Then these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.
041222 Philip came and told Andrew. And again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
041223 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.
041224 Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.
041225 He who loves his life shall lose it. And he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.
041226 If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant shall be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.
041227 And My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour? But for this cause I came to this hour.
041228 Father, glorify Your name! Then there came a voice from the heaven saying , I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.
041229 Then the crowd who stood by and heard said that it thundered. Others said, An angel spoke to Him.
041230 Jesus answered and said, This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sakes.
041231 Now is the judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
041232 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.
041233 But He said this, signifying what kind of death He was about to die.
041234 The crowd answered Him, We have heard out of the law that Christ lives forever. How do you say, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
041235 Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, lest darkness come upon you. For he who walks in darkness does not know where he goes.
041236 While you have the Light, believe in the Light so that you may become sons of Light. Jesus spoke these things and departed and was hidden from them.
041237 But though He had done so many miracles before them, yet they did not believe on Him,
041238 so that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
041239 Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,
041240 "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them."
041241 Isaiah said these things when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.
041242 Still, however, even out of the rulers, many did believe on Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;
041243 for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
041244 But Jesus cried out and said, He who believes on Me does not believe on Me but on Him who sent Me.
041245 And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.
041246 I have come as a Light into the world, so that whoever believes on Me should not remain in darkness.
041247 And if any one hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him, for I do not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
041248 He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
041249 For I have not spoken of Myself, but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.
041250 And I know that His command is life everlasting. Therefore whatever I speak, even as the Father said to Me, so I speak.
041301 And before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come when He should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own in the world, He loved them to the end.
041302 And when supper had ended, the Devil now having put into the heart of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon to betray Him,
041303 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and went to God,
041304 He rose up from supper and laid aside His garments. And He took a towel and girded Himself.
041305 After that He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
041306 Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?
041307 Jesus answered and said to him, You do not know what I do now, but you shall know hereafter.
041308 Peter said to Him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.
041309 Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and head.
041310 Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no need except to wash his feet, but is clean every whit. And you are clean, but not all.
041311 For He knew who would betray Him. Therefore He said, You are not all clean.
041312 So after He had washed their feet and had taken His garments and had reclined again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?
041313 You call Me the Teacher, and Lord, and you say well, for I AM.
041314 If then I, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
041315 For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.
041316 Truly, truly, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his master, neither is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.
041317 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
041318 I do not speak of you all; I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me."
041319 From now I tell you before it comes, so that when it happens you may believe that I AM.
041320 Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I send receives Me. And he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
041321 When Jesus had said this, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you shall betray Me.
041322 Then the disciples looked upon one another, wondering of whom He spoke.
041323 But there was one of His disciples leaning upon Jesus' bosom, the one whom Jesus loved.
041324 Simon Peter therefore signaled to him to ask whom it might be of whom He spoke.
041325 And lying on Jesus' breast, he said to him, Lord, who is it?
041326 Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the morsel when I have dipped it . And dipping the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
041327 And after the morsel, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.
041328 But no one reclining knew for what reason He spoke this to him.
041329 For some thought, because Judas had the moneybag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy what we have need of for the feast; or that he should give something to the poor.
041330 He then, having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.
041331 Then when he had left, Jesus said, Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.
041332 If God is glorified in Him, God shall also glorify Him in Himself, and shall immediately glorify Him.
041333 Little children, I am with you yet a little while. You shall seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come, so I now say to you.
041334 I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. As I have loved you, you should also love one another.
041335 By this all shall know that you are My disciples, if you have love toward one another.
041336 Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where do You go? Jesus answered him, Where I go you cannot now follow Me, but you shall follow Me afterward.
041337 Peter said to Him, Lord, why cannot I follow You now? I will lay down my life for Your sake.
041338 Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for My sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, The cock shall not crow until you have denied Me three times.
041401 Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in Me.
041402 In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so , I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
041403 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, so that where I am, you may be also.
041404 And where I go you know, and the way you know.
041405 Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You go, and how can we know the way?
041406 Jesus said to him, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no one comes to the Father but by Me.
041407 If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also. And from now on you know Him and have seen Him.
041408 Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.
041409 Jesus said to him, Have I been with you such a long time and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. And how do you say, Show us the Father?
041410 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak of Myself, but the Father who dwells in Me, He does the works.
041411 Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the very works themselves.
041412 Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes on Me, the works that I do he shall do also, and greater works than these he shall do, because I go to My Father.
041413 And whatever you may ask in My name, that I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
041414 If you ask anything in My name, I will do it .
041415 If you love Me, keep My commandments.
041416 And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, so that He may be with you forever,
041417 the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive because it does not see Him nor know Him. But you know Him, for He dwells with you and shall be in you.
041418 I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.
041419 Yet a little while and the world does not see Me any more. But you see Me. Because I live, you shall live also.
041420 At that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.
041421 He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me. And he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will reveal Myself to him.
041422 Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, Lord, how is it that You will reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?
041423 Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loves Me, he will keep My Word. And My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him.
041424 He who does not love Me does not keep My words, and the Word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me.
041425 I have spoken these things to you, being present with you.
041426 But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.
041427 Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
041428 You have heard how I said to you, I go away and I am coming to you again . If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, I go to the Father, for My Father is greater than I.
041429 And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens you might believe.
041430 I shall no longer speak many things with you, for the ruler of this world comes, and he has nothing in Me.
041431 But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father has given Me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go away from here.
041501 I am the True Vine, and My Father is the Vinedresser.
041502 Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away. And every one that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bring forth more fruit.
041503 Now you are clean through the Word which I have spoken to you.
041504 Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.
041505 I am the Vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.
041506 If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered. And they gather and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
041507 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you.
041508 In this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, so you shall be My disciples.
041509 As the Father has loved Me, so I have loved you; continue in My love.
041510 If you keep My commandments, you shall abide in My love, even as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.
041511 I have spoken these things to you so that My joy might remain in you and your joy might be full.
041512 This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.
041513 No one has greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
041514 You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.
041515 No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master does. But I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.
041516 You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you shall ask of the Father in My name, He may give it to you.
041517 These things I command you, that you love one another.
041518 If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you.
041519 If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
041520 Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they have kept My saying, they will also keep yours.
041521 But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me.
041522 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
041523 He who hates Me hates My Father also.
041524 If I had not done among them the works which no other did, they would not have had sin. But now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father.
041525 But that the Word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, "They hated Me without a cause."
041526 And when the Comforter has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He shall testify of Me.
041527 And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
041601 I have spoken these things to you so that you should not be offended.
041602 They shall put you out of the synagogue. But an hour is coming that everyone who kills you will think that he bears God service.
041603 And they will do these things to you because they have not known the Father nor Me.
041604 But I have told you these things so that when the hour shall come you may remember that I told you of them. And I did not say these things to you at the beginning because I was with you.
041605 But now I go to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, Where do You go?
041606 But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
041607 But I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you. But if I depart, I will send Him to you.
041608 And when that One comes, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.
041609 Concerning sin, because they do not believe on Me;
041610 concerning righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;
041611 concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.
041612 I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
041613 However, when He, the Spirit of Truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth. For He shall not speak of Himself, but whatever He hears, He shall speak. And He will announce to you things to come.
041614 He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will announce it to you.
041615 All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and will announce it to you.
041616 A little while and you will not see Me; and again a little while , and you will see Me, because I go to the Father.
041617 Then His disciples said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you will not see Me, and again a little and you will see Me? And, Because I go to the Father?
041618 Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little while ? We do not know what He is saying.
041619 Then Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and said to them, Do you seek answers with one another concerning this, because I said, A little while and you shall not see Me; and again a little while, and you shall see Me?
041620 Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. And you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
041621 The woman has grief when she bears, because her hour has come. But when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, because of the joy that a man is born into the world.
041622 And therefore you now have sorrow. But I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.
041623 And in that day you shall ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in My name, He will give you.
041624 Before now you have asked nothing in My name; ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.
041625 I have spoken these things to you in parables, but the time is coming when I shall no more speak to you in parables, but I will show you plainly of the Father.
041626 At that day you will ask in My name; and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,
041627 for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God.
041628 I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world. Again I leave the world and go to the Father.
041629 The disciples said to Him, Lo, now You speak plainly and speak no parable.
041630 Now we know that You know all things and do not need that anyone should ask You. By this we believe that You have come forth from God.
041631 Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?
041632 Behold, the hour comes, yea, has now come, that you will be scattered, each man to his own things, and you will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.
041633 I have spoken these things to you so that you might have peace in Me. In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer. I have overcome the world.
041701 Jesus spoke these words and lifted up His eyes to Heaven and said, Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son so that Your Son also may glorify You,
041702 even as You have given Him authority over all flesh so that He should give eternal life to all You have given Him.
041703 And this is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.
041704 I have glorified You upon the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.
041705 And now Father, glorify Me with Yourself with the glory which I had with You before the world was.
041706 I have revealed Your name to the men whom You gave to Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.
041707 Now they have known that all things, whatever You have given Me, are from You.
041708 For I have given to them the words which You gave Me, and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from You. And they have believed that You sent Me.
041709 I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.
041710 And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I am glorified in them.
041711 And now I am in the world no longer, but these are in the world, and I come to You, Holy Father. Keep them in Your name, those whom You have given Me, so that they may be one as We are .
041712 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those that You have given Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
041713 And now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world that they might have My joy fulfilled in them.
041714 I have given them Your Word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
041715 I do not pray for You to take them out of the world, but for You to keep them from the evil.
041716 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
041717 Sanctify them through Your truth. Your Word is truth.
041718 As You have sent Me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.
041719 And I sanctify Myself for their sakes, so that they also might be sanctified in truth.
041720 And I do not pray for these alone, but for those also who shall believe on Me through their word,
041721 that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You have sent Me.
041722 And I have given them the glory which You have given Me, that they may be one, even as We are one,
041723 I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them as You have loved Me.
041724 Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me, that they may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me, for You have loved Me before the foundation of the world.
041725 O righteous Father, indeed the world has not known You; but I have known You, and these have known that You have sent me.
041726 And I made known to them Your name, and will make it known, so that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them.
041801 Having spoken these words, Jesus went out with His disciples over the winter stream Kidron, where there was a garden. He and His disciples entered into it.
041802 And Judas who betrayed Him also knew the place. For Jesus oftentimes went there with His disciples.
041803 Then Judas, having received a band and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
041804 Then Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon Him, went out and said to them, Whom do you seek?
041805 They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I AM! And Judas who betrayed Him also stood with them.
041806 Then as soon as He had said to them, I AM, they went backward and fell to the ground.
041807 Then He asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
041808 Jesus answered, I have told you that I AM. Therefore if you seek Me, let these go away;
041809 (that the word might be fulfilled which He spoke, " Of those whom You have given Me, I have lost not one of them").
041810 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. And the servant's name was Malchus.
041811 Then Jesus said to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath. The cup which My Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?
041812 Then the band, and the chiliarch, and under-officers of the Jews together seized Jesus and bound Him.
041813 And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.
041814 And Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
041815 And Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.
041816 But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple went out, the one who was known to the high priest, and spoke to her who kept the door and brought Peter in.
041817 Then the girl who kept the door said to Peter, Are you not also one of this man's disciples? He said, I am not.
041818 And the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold. And they warmed themselves . And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.
041819 Then the high priest asked Jesus of His disciples and of His teaching.
041820 Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where the Jews always resort, and I have said nothing in secret.
041821 Why do you ask Me? Ask those who heard me what I have said to them. Behold, they know what I said.
041822 And when He had spoken this way, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest so?
041823 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?
041824 Then Annas had sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
041825 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Then they said to him, Are you not also one of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not.
041826 One of the servants of the high priest, being kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?
041827 Peter then denied again. And immediately a cock crowed.
041828 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the praetorium. And it was early. And they did not go into the praetorium, that they should not be defiled, and that they might eat the Passover.
041829 Then Pilate went out to them and said, What charge do you bring against this man?
041830 They answered and said to him, If he were not an evildoer, then we would not have delivered him up to you.
041831 Then Pilate said to them, You take him and judge him according to your law. Then the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death
041832 (that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He spoke signifying what death He was about to die).
041833 Then Pilate entered into the praetorium again and called Jesus and said to him, Are you the king of the Jews?
041834 Jesus answered him, Do you say this thing of yourself, or did others say it to you about Me?
041835 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?
041836 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would fight so that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But now My kingdom is not from here.
041837 Pilate then said to Him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say it that I am a king. To this end I was born, and for this cause I came into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.
041838 Pilate said to Him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, I find no fault in him.
041839 But you have a custom that I should release one to you at the Passover. Then do you desire that I release to you the king of the Jews?
041840 Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas! But Barabbas was a robber.
041901 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and flogged Him .
041902 And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns and put it on His head. And they put a purple robe on Him,
041903 and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they struck Him with their hands.
041904 Then Pilate went out again and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you so that you may know that I find no fault in him.
041905 Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the man!
041906 Then when the chief priests and under-officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify Him ! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in him.
041907 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
041908 Then when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid.
041909 And he went again into the praetorium and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer.
041910 Then Pilate said to him, Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?
041911 Jesus answered, You could have no authority against Me unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.
041912 From this time , Pilate sought to release Him. But the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.
041913 Then when Pilate heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement (but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha).
041914 And it was the preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold your king!
041915 But they cried out, Away with him ! Away with him ! Crucify him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
041916 Then he delivered Him up to them that He might be crucified. And they took Jesus and led Him away.
041917 And bearing His cross, He went out to a place called, The Place of a Skull (which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha)
041918 where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the middle.
041919 And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
041920 Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
041921 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, the king of the Jews, but that he said, I am king of the Jews.
041922 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
041923 Then when they had crucified Jesus, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, one part to each soldier; and also His tunic. And the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
041924 Therefore they said among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to find whose it shall be (that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, "They parted my garments among them, and for my garment they cast lots"). Therefore the soldiers did these things.
041925 And His mother stood by the cross of Jesus, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
041926 Then when Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, Woman, behold your son!
041927 Then He said to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her into his own home .
041928 After this, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, I thirst.
041929 Then a vessel full of vinegar was set. And they filled a sponge with sour wine and put it upon hyssop, and put it to His mouth.
041930 Then when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and gave up the spirit.
041931 Then the Jews, because it was Preparation, begged Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath. For that sabbath was a high day.
041932 Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with Him.
041933 But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
041934 But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a lance, and instantly there came out blood and water.
041935 And he who saw bore record, and his record is true. And he knows that he speaks true, so that you might believe.
041936 For these things were done so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "Not a bone of Him shall be broken."
041937 And again another Scripture says, "They shall look upon Him whom they pierced."
041938 And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews) begged of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave permission. Then he came and took the body of Jesus.
041939 And Nicodemus also came, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
041940 Then they took the body of Jesus and wound it with linens with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews to bury.
041941 And in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one yet had been placed.
041942 There, then, because of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.
042001 The first of the sabbaths Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb, darkness still being on it , and she saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
042002 Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.
042003 Therefore Peter and that other disciple went forth and came to the tomb.
042004 So they both ran together. And the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb.
042005 And stooping down he saw the linens lying, yet he did not go in.
042006 Then Simon Peter came following him and went into the tomb. And he saw the linens lying there .
042007 And the grave-cloth that was on His head was not lying with the linens, but was wrapped up in one place by itself.
042008 Therefore, then, that other disciple also went in, the one who came first to the tomb. And he saw and believed.
042009 For as yet they did not know the Scripture that He must rise again from the dead.
042010 Then the disciples went away again to themselves.
042011 But Mary stood outside of the tomb, weeping. And as she wept, she stooped down into the tomb.
042012 And she saw two angels in white sitting there, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
042013 And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.
042014 And when she had said this, she turned backward and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.
042015 Jesus said to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Supposing Him to be the gardener, she said to Him, Sir, if you have carried Him away from here, tell me where you have laid Him and I will take Him away.
042016 Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned herself and said to Him, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master!)
042017 Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father. But go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and Your Father, and to My God and your God.
042018 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that He had spoken these things to her.
042019 Then the same day at evening, being the first of the sabbaths, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace to you!
042020 And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.
042021 Then Jesus said to them again, Peace to you. As My Father has sent Me, even so I send you.
042022 And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.
042023 Of whomever sins you remit, they are remitted to them. Of whomever sins you retain, they are retained.
042024 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
042025 The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I shall see the print of the nails in His hands, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe.
042026 And after eight days the disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace to you!
042027 Then He said to Thomas, Reach your finger here and behold My hands; and reach your hand here and thrust it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.
042028 And Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!
042029 Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen Me you have believed. Blessed are they who have not seen and have believed.
042030 And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.
042031 But these are written so that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might have life in His name.
042101 After these things Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He revealed Himself this way:
042102 Simon Peter, and Thomas called the Twin, and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.
042103 Simon Peter said to them, I am going out to fish. They said to him, We will go with you also. They went out and entered into a boat immediately. And that night they caught nothing.
042104 But when the morning had come, Jesus stood on the shore. But the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
042105 Then Jesus said to them, Children, do you have anything to eat? They answered Him, No.
042106 And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find. Therefore they cast, and now they no longer had the strength to draw, from the multitude of fish.
042107 Then that disciple whom Jesus loves said to Peter, It is the Lord! Then hearing that it is the Lord, Simon Peter girded on his coat (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.
042108 And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits), dragging the net of fish.
042109 Then when they went up on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and a fish lying on it , and bread.
042110 And Jesus said to them, Bring from the fish which you have now caught.
042111 Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of big fish, a hundred and fifty-three. And though there were so many, the net was not torn.
042112 Jesus said to them, Come, break fast. And none of the disciples dared to ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it was the Lord.
042113 Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave to them, and in the same way the little fish.
042114 This is now the three times Jesus was revealed to His disciples, He being risen from the dead.
042115 Then when they broke fast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.
042116 He said to him the second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My sheep.
042117 He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me? Peter was grieved because He said to him a third time , Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things, You know that I love You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.
042118 Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you wished. But when you grow old, you shall stretch forth your hands and another shall gird you and carry you where you do not wish.
042119 He spoke this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, Follow Me.
042120 Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following (the one who also leaned on His breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he who betrays You?)
042121 Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, and what of this one?
042122 Jesus said to him, If I desire that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.
042123 Then this saying went abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, He shall not die, but, If I desire that he remain until I come, what is that to you?
042124 This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.
042125 And there are also many things, whatever Jesus did, which, if they should be written singly, I suppose the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.
050101 Truly, O Theophilus, I made the first report as to all things that Jesus began both to do and teach
050102 until the day He was taken up, having given directions to the apostles whom He chose, through the Holy Spirit;
050103 to whom He also presented Himself living after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them through forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.
050104 And having met with them , He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father which you heard from Me.
050105 For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.
050106 Then, indeed, these coming together, they asked Him, saying, Lord, do You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
050107 And He said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in His own authority.
050108 But you shall receive power, the Holy Spirit coming upon you. And you shall be witnesses to Me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the end of the earth.
050109 And saying these things, as they watched, He was taken up. And a cloud received Him out of their sight.
050110 And while they were looking intently into the heaven, He having gone, even behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them,
050111 who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into the heaven? This same Jesus who is taken up from you into Heaven, will come in the way you have seen Him going into Heaven.
050112 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount Of Olive Grove, which is a sabbath day's journey from Jerusalem.
050113 And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, where Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James;
050114 these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
050115 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said, ( the number of names together was about a hundred and twenty,)
050116 Men, brothers, this Scripture must have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who became guide to those who seized Jesus.
050117 For he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry.
050118 Indeed, then, this one purchased a field with the reward of unrighteousness. And falling headlong, he burst apart in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.
050119 And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem, so much so that that field is called in their own dialect, Akeldama, that is to say, Field of Blood.
050120 For it is written in the Book of Psalms, "Let his estate become forsaken, and he not be living in it." And, "Let another take his overseership."
050121 Therefore, it is right that one of these men who have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,
050122 beginning from the baptism of John to that same day that He was taken up from us, to become a witness with us of His resurrection.
050123 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
050124 And they prayed and said, You, Lord, knower of all hearts, show which one You chose from these two,
050125 to take the share of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell, to go to his own place.
050126 And they gave forth their lots. And the lot fell upon Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
050201 And in the fulfilling of the day of Pentecost, they were all with one accord in one place.
050202 And suddenly a sound came out of the heaven as borne along by the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
050203 And tongues as of fire appeared to them, being distributed; and it sat upon each of them.
050204 And they were all filled of the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
050205 And dwelling at Jerusalem there were Jews, devout men out of every nation under heaven.
050206 But this sound occurring, the multitude came together and were confounded, because they each heard them speaking in his own dialect.
050207 And they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, Behold, are not these who speak all Galileans?
050208 And how do we each hear in our own dialect in which we were born?
050209 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
050210 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
050211 Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking the great things of God in our own languages.
050212 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying to one another, What does this mean?
050213 But others mocking said, These men are full of sweet wine.
050214 But Peter, standing up with the Eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them, Men, Jews, and all who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.
050215 For these are not drunk as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day.
050216 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel:
050217 "And it shall be in the last days, says God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.
050218 And in those days I will pour out My Spirit upon My slaves and My slave women, and they shall prophesy.
050219 And I will give wonders in the heaven above, and miracles on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
050220 The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before that great and glorious Day of the Lord.
050221 And it shall be that everyone who shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
050222 Men, Israelites, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by powerful works, and wonders and miracles, which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know,
050223 this One given to you by the before-determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken and by lawless hands, crucifying Him , you put Him to death;
050224 whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it.
050225 For David speaks concerning Him, "I foresaw the Lord always before me, because He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.
050226 Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue was glad; and also My flesh shall rest in hope,
050227 because You will not leave My soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your holy One to see corruption.
050228 You revealed to Me the ways of life. You will fill Me with joy with Your countenance."
050229 Men, brothers, it is permitted to say to you with plainness as to the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
050230 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit upon his throne,
050231 seeing this beforehand, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor would His flesh see corruption,
050232 God raised up this Jesus, of which we all are witnesses.
050233 Therefore being exalted to the right of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured out this which you now see and hear.
050234 For David has not ascended into the heavens, but he says himself, "The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand
050235 until I place Your enemies as a footstool to Your feet."
050236 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God made this same Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
050237 And hearing this , they were stabbed in the heart, and said to Peter and to the other apostles, Men, brothers, what shall we do?
050238 Then Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ to remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
050239 For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.
050240 And with many other words he earnestly testified and exhorted, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.
050241 Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. And the same day there were added about three thousand souls.
050242 And they were continuing steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, and in fellowship and in the breaking of the loaves, and in prayers.
050243 And fear came on every soul. And many wonders and miracles took place through the apostles.
050244 And all who believed were together and had all things common.
050245 And they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.
050246 And continuing with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they shared food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
050247 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.
050301 And on the same day Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour .
050302 And a certain man, who was lame from his mother's womb, was being carried. And they laid him daily at that temple gate which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered into the temple.
050303 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms.
050304 And fastening his eyes on him, Peter with John said, Look on us!
050305 And he paid heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.
050306 But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!
050307 And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up. And immediately his feet and ankle-bones received strength.
050308 And leaping up, he stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
050309 And all the people saw him walking and praising God.
050310 And they recognized him, that it was him who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
050311 And as the lame one who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
050312 And seeing this , Peter answered the people, Men, Israelites, why do you marvel at this? Or why do you stare at us, as though we had made this man to walk by our own power or holiness?
050313 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His son Jesus, whom you delivered up, denying Him in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to let Him go.
050314 But you denied the Holy and Just One and desired a murderer to be given to you.
050315 And you killed the Prince of Life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
050316 And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, this one whom you see and know, His name made firm. And the faith which came through Him has given him this perfect soundness before you.
050317 And now, brothers, I know that you did it through ignorance, as also your rulers did .
050318 But those things which God before had shown by the mouth of all His prophets, that Christ should suffer, He fulfilled in this manner.
050319 Therefore repent and convert so that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.
050320 And He shall send Jesus Christ, who before was proclaimed to you,
050321 whom Heaven truly needs to receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of His holy prophets since the world began.
050322 For Moses truly said to the fathers, " The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet to you from your brothers, One like me. You shall hear Him in all things, whatever He may say to you.
050323 And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people."
050324 And also all the prophets from Samuel and those following after, as many as spoke, have likewise foretold of these days.
050325 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, "And in your Seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed."
050326 Having raised up His son Jesus, God sent Him to you first, to bless you in turning every one of you away from his iniquities.
050401 And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the temple commander, and the Sadducees came on them,
050402 being grieved that they taught the people, even to announce through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
050403 And they laid hands on them and put them under guard until the next day, for it was already evening.
050404 But many of those who heard the Word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
050405 And it happened on the next day that their rulers and elders and scribes, gathered to Jerusalem,
050406 and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.
050407 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name have you done this?
050408 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,
050409 if we are examined today on a good work for an infirm man, by what this one has been healed,
050410 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in this name does this man stand before you whole.
050411 This is the Stone which you builders have counted worthless, and He has become the Head of the Corner.
050412 And there is salvation in no other One; for there is no other name under Heaven given among men by which we must be saved.
050413 But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were unlearned and uneducated men, they marveled. And they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.
050414 And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it .
050415 And when they had commanded them to go aside out of the sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,
050416 saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all those dwelling in Jerusalem. And we cannot deny it .
050417 But, so that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, that they speak to no man in this name from now on.
050418 And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus.
050419 But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right before God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.
050420 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
050421 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way as to how they might punish them, because of the people. For all glorified God for that which was done.
050422 For the man on whom this miracle of healing occurred was more than forty years old .
050423 And being let go, they went to their own company and reported what the chief priests and elders had said to them .
050424 And having heard, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, Lord, You are the God who made the heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that is in them;
050425 who by the mouth of Your servant David has said, "Why did the nations rage and the people imagine vain things?
050426 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ."
050427 For truly, against Your holy child Jesus, whom You have anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and the people of Israel, were gathered together
050428 in order to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel determined before to be done.
050429 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your Word,
050430 by stretching forth of Your hand for healing, and miracles, and wonders may be done by the name of Your holy child Jesus.
050431 And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.
050432 And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul. And not one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own. But they had all things common.
050433 And the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power. And great grace was on them all.
050434 For neither was anyone needy among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
050435 and they laid them down at the apostles' feet. And distribution was made to every man according as he had need.
050436 And Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being translated, The son of consolation), a Levite, a Cypriot by race,
050437 a field being his, selling it , he bore the proceeds and placed them at the apostles' feet.
050501 And a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession.
050502 And he kept back part of the price, his wife also knowing, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.
050503 But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
050504 While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own authority? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.
050505 And hearing these words, Ananias fell down and expired. And great fear came on all those who heard these things.
050506 And the younger ones arose, wound him up, and carrying him out, they buried him .
050507 And it was about the space of three hours afterward, when his wife (not knowing what was done) came in.
050508 And Peter answered her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.
050509 Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out.
050510 Then at once she fell down at his feet and expired. And the younger ones found her dead, and, carrying her out, buried her beside her husband.
050511 And great fear came on all the church and on as many as heard these things.
050512 And many miracles and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's Porch.
050513 And of the rest no one dared to join himself to them, but the people magnified them;
050514 and more believing ones were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;
050515 So as to carry out the sick into the streets and place them on cots and mattresses, so that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
050516 And also a multitude came from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick ones, and those being tormented by unclean spirits, who were all healed.
050517 And rising up, the high priest, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with anger,
050518 And laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the public custody.
050519 But the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night and brought them out, and said,
050520 Go! Stand and speak all the words of this Life to the people in the temple.
050521 And hearing, they went into the temple about dawn, and taught. But the high priest came, and those with him. And they called the sanhedrin together, and all the elderhood of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
050522 But having come near, the officers did not find them in the prison. And returning, reported,
050523 saying, We indeed found the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside in front of the doors. But having opened it, we found no one inside.
050524 And when the high priest and the temple commander and the chief priests heard these things, they were bewildered about them, what this might be.
050525 But one came, reporting to them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.
050526 Then the commander went with the officers and brought them, not with force, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
050527 And bringing them, they stood in the sanhedrin. And the high priest asked them,
050528 saying, Did we not strictly command you that you not teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood on us.
050529 And Peter and the apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.
050530 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed and hanged on a tree.
050531 This One God has exalted to be a Ruler and Savior to His right hand in order to give repentance and remission of sins to Israel.
050532 And we are His witnesses of these things. And so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.
050533 But those hearing were cut to the heart , and they took counsel to kill them.
050534 Then there stood up one in the sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law honored among all the people. And he commanded the apostles to be put outside a little space.
050535 And he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men.
050536 For before these days Theudas rose up, boasting himself to be somebody; a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him; who was slain. And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered and brought to nothing.
050537 After this one, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the Registration, and drew away considerable people after him. Yet that one perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.
050538 And now I say to you, withdraw from these men and let them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing.
050539 But if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God.
050540 And they obeyed him. And calling the apostles, beating them , they commanded not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
050541 Then indeed they departed from the presence of the sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be shamed for His name.
050542 And every day in the temple, and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching the gospel: Jesus Christ.
050601 And in those days, the disciples having multiplied, a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews occurred, because their widows were overlooked in the daily serving.
050602 And the Twelve called near the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not pleasing to us, leaving the Word of God, to serve tables.
050603 Therefore, brothers, look out among you seven men being witnessed to, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this duty.
050604 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.
050605 And the saying pleased all the multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicholas, a proselyte of Antioch.
050606 They set these before the apostles. And having prayed, they laid hands on them.
050607 And the word of God was increasing. And the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was multiplying exceedingly; even a great crowd of the priests obeyed the faith.
050608 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
050609 Then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and from Asia, disputing with Stephen.
050610 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
050611 And they induced men to be saying, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.
050612 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes. And coming on, they seized him and brought him to the sanhedrin.
050613 And they set up false witnesses, who said, This man does not cease speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the Law.
050614 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
050615 And looking intently at him. all those sitting in the sanhedrin saw his face as if it were the face of an angel.
050701 Then the high priest said, Then do you so hold these things?
050702 And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.
050703 And He said to him, "Go out from your land and from your kindred, and come into a land which I shall show you."
050704 Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And from there, when his father was dead, he moved into this land in which you now dwell.
050705 And He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not even a foot-breadth. And He promised that He would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, there being no child to him.
050706 And God spoke in this way, that his seed would be a tenant in another land, and that they would enslave it and oppress it four hundred years.
050707 And God said, "I will judge the nation to whom they shall be in bondage," and "after these things they will come out and will serve Me in this place."
050708 And He gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham fathered Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day. And Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
050709 And being jealous of Joseph, the patriarchs sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him
050710 and plucked him out from all his afflictions, and He gave him favor and wisdom over against Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he appointed him governor over Egypt and all his household.
050711 But a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and a great affliction. And our fathers found no food.
050712 But hearing grain was in Egypt, Jacob sent out our fathers first.
050713 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race was made known to Pharaoh.
050714 And seeing, Joseph called his father Jacob, and all his kindred, seventy-five souls.
050715 And Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers,
050716 and were carried over into Shechem. And they were laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price of silver from the sons of Emmor the father of Shechem.
050717 But as the time was drawing near, of the promise which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
050718 until another king arose who did not know Joseph.
050719 Dealing subtly with our race, this one oppressed our fathers, causing their infants to be exposed, so as not to be left alive.
050720 In this time Moses was born, and was beautiful to God, who was brought up three months in his father's house.
050721 And he being cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and reared him for a son to her.
050722 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds.
050723 And when a period of forty years was fulfilled to him, it arose in his heart to look upon his brothers, the sons of Israel.
050724 And seeing one being wronged, he defended him . and avenged him who was oppressed and struck the Egyptian.
050725 For he thought his brothers would understand that God would give them deliverance by his hand. But they did not understand.
050726 And the next day he appeared to them while fighting. And he urged them to peace, saying, Men, you are brothers, why do you wrong one another?
050727 But he who wronged his neighbor thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
050728 Will you not kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?
050729 And Moses fled at this word, and became a temporary resident in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons.
050730 And forty years being fulfilled to him, the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai in a flame of fire in a bush.
050731 And seeing it , Moses marveled at the sight. And as he drew near to see, the voice of the Lord came to him:
050732 saying , "I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." But Moses trembled and dared not look.
050733 Then the Lord said to him, "Loosen the sandal on your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground."
050734 "I have seen, the affliction of My people in Egypt, and I have heard their groan; and I came down to pluck them out. And now come, I will send you into Egypt."
050735 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? God has sent this one to be a ruler and a redeemer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the Bush.
050736 He brought them out after he had worked wonders and miracles in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness forty years.
050737 This is that Moses who said to the sons of Israel, " The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet to you from your brothers, One like me; you shall hear Him."
050738 This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him in Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received the living words to give to us,
050739 to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him away and turned back again to Egypt in their hearts,
050740 saying to Aaron, "Make us gods to go before us, for as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."
050741 And they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice to the idol and rejoiced in the work of their own hands.
050742 Then God turned and gave them over to serve the host of the heavens, as it is written in the book of the Prophets: "O house of Israel, have you offered to Me slain beasts and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness?
050743 Yea, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, images which you made in order to worship them; and I will remove you beyond Babylon."
050744 The tabernacle of witness was among our fathers in the wilderness, as commanded by God , speaking to Moses to make it according to the pattern that he had seen.
050745 Which also having received it by inheritance with Joshua, our fathers, with Joshua, in taking possession of the nations whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David,
050746 who found favor with God and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob;
050747 but Solomon built Him a house.
050748 But, the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says,
050749 "Heaven is My throne and earth is My footstool. What house will you build Me, says the Lord, or what is the place of My rest?
050750 Has not My hand made all these things?"
050751 O stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did , so you do.
050752 Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of whom you have now been the betrayers and murderers;
050753 who received the Law through disposition of angels, and did not keep it.
050754 And hearing these things, they were cut to their hearts. And they gnashed on him with their teeth.
050755 But being full of the Holy Spirit, looking up intently into Heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
050756 And he said, Behold, I see Heaven opened and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
050757 And crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears and ran on him with one accord.
050758 And throwing him outside the city, they stoned him . And the witnesses laid their clothes down at the feet of a young man named Saul.
050759 And they stoned Stephen, who was calling on God and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
050760 And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not lay this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
050801 And Saul was consenting to his death. And in that day there was a great persecution on the church at Jerusalem, and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
050802 And devout men buried Stephen and made a great mourning over him.
050803 But Saul ravaged the church, entering into every house. And dragging men and women, he delivered them up to prison.
050804 Then, indeed, the ones who had been scattered passed through, preaching the gospel, the Word.
050805 And Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them.
050806 And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the many miracles which he did.
050807 For out of those having unclean spirits, many came out, crying with loud voice. And many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.
050808 And there was great joy in that city.
050809 But a certain man called Simon had long been conjuring in the city, and amazing the nation of Samaria, claiming himself to be some great one.
050810 All gave heed to him , from the least to the greatest, saying, This one is the great power of God.
050811 And they were paying attention to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with conjuring.
050812 But when they believed Philip preaching the gospel, the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
050813 Then Simon himself believed also, and being baptized, he continued with Philip. And seeing miracles and mighty works happening, he was amazed.
050814 And the apostles in Jerusalem hearing that Samaria had received the Word of God, they sent Peter and John to them;
050815 who when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
050816 For as yet He had not fallen on any of them, they were baptized only in the name of the Lord Jesus.
050817 Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
050818 And when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
050819 saying, Give me this power also, that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.
050820 But Peter said to him, May your silver perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
050821 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God.
050822 Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.
050823 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.
050824 And answering Simon said, You pray to the Lord for me that none of these things which you have spoken may come on me.
050825 Then, indeed, having earnestly testified and having spoken the Word of the Lord also having preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans, they returned to Jerusalem.
050826 And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise and go toward the south, on the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is a deserted place .
050827 And he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
050828 was returning. And sitting in his chariot he read Isaiah the prophet.
050829 Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join yourself to this chariot.
050830 And Philip ran there to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you indeed understand what you are reading?
050831 And he said, How can I unless some man should guide me? And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him.
050832 And the content of the Scripture which he read was this: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so He opened not His mouth.
050833 In His humiliation His judgment was taken away, and who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth."
050834 And the eunuch answered Philip and said, I beg you, of whom does the prophet speak this? Of himself or of some other man?
050835 Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same Scripture and preached the gospel of Jesus to him.
050836 And as they passed along the way, they came on some water. And the eunuch said, See, here is water, what hinders me from being baptized?
050837 Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, it is lawful. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
050838 And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch. And he baptized him.
050839 And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.
050840 But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached the gospel in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.
050901 And Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
050902 and asked letters from him to Damascus to the synagogues; so that if he found any of the Way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
050903 But in going, it happened as he drew near to Damascus, even suddenly a light from the heaven shone around him.
050904 And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?
050905 And he said, Who are you, lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute. It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
050906 And trembling and astonished, he said, Lord, what will You have me to do? And the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the city, and you shall be told what you must do.
050907 And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, indeed hearing a voice but seeing no one.
050908 And Saul was lifted up from the earth, his eyes were opened, but he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
050909 And he was three days not seeing, and did not eat or drink.
050910 And there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold me, Lord.
050911 And the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the street which is called Straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,
050912 and has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him so that he might receive his sight.
050913 And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints at Jerusalem.
050914 And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your Name.
050915 But the Lord said to him, Go! For this one is a chosen vessel to Me, to bear My name before nations and kings and the sons of Israel.
050916 For I will show him what great things he must suffer for My name's sake.
050917 And Ananias went and entered into the house. And putting his hands on him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, Jesus, who appeared to you in the way in which you came, has sent me to you that you might see and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
050918 And instantly scales as it were fell from his eyes, and he instantly saw again. And rising up, he was baptized.
050919 And taking food, he was strengthened. And Saul was certain days with the disciples in Damascus.
050920 And immediately he proclaimed Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.
050921 But all who heard him were amazed and said, Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem and came here for that reason, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?
050922 But Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this One is the Christ.
050923 And after many days had been fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him.
050924 But their plot was known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night in order to kill him.
050925 Then the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall in a basket.
050926 And arriving in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join himself to the disciples. But they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple.
050927 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and told them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had spoken boldly in Damascus in the name of Jesus.
050928 And he was with them, coming in and going out in Jerusalem.
050929 And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and argued with the Hellenists. But they seized him in order to kill him.
050930 But knowing, the brothers brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus.
050931 Then, indeed, the churches had rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, and having been built up. And having gone on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were increased.
050932 And it happened, passing through all, Peter also came down to the saints who lived at Lydda.
050933 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had lain eight years on a mattress, paralyzed.
050934 And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you; rise up and spread for yourself! And he arose immediately.
050935 And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
050936 And in Joppa was a certain disciple named Tabitha (which translated is called Dorcas). She was full of good works and kind deeds which she did.
050937 And it happened in those days, becoming sick, she died. And washing her, they laid her in an upper room.
050938 And, because Lydda was near Joppa, hearing that Peter is in it, the disciples sent two men to him, begging him not to delay to come to them.
050939 And rising up, Peter went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper room. And all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them.
050940 And putting them all out, Peter knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise! And she opened her eyes. And when she saw Peter, she sat up.
050941 And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. And when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
050942 And it was known throughout all Joppa. And many believed in the Lord.
050943 And it was many days that he remained in Joppa, with one Simon, a tanner.
051001 And a certain man named Cornelius was in Caesarea, a centurion of the Italian cohort,
051002 one devout and fearing God, with all his household, both doing many merciful deeds to the people, and praying continually to God.
051003 About the ninth hour of the day he saw plainly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, Cornelius!
051004 And he was gazing at him, and becoming terrified, he said, What is it, lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your merciful deeds have come up for a memorial before God.
051005 And now send men to Joppa and call for Simon, whose last name is Peter.
051006 He is staying with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside. He will tell you what you must do.
051007 And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from those who waited on him continually.
051008 And explaining all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
051009 On the next day, as these went on the road, and drawing near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.
051010 And he became very hungry and desired to eat. But while they made ready, an ecstasy fell on him.
051011 And he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel like a sheet coming down to him, being bound at the four corners and let down to the earth;
051012 in which were all the four-footed animals of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the reptiles, and the birds of the heaven.
051013 And a voice came to him, saying, Rise, Peter! Kill and eat!
051014 But Peter said, Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.
051015 And the voice spoke to him again the second time , What God has made clean, you do not call common.
051016 This happened three times , and the vessel was received up again into the heaven.
051017 And while Peter doubted within himself what the vision which he had seen might be, even behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had asked for Simon's house and stood on the porch.
051018 And they called and asked if Simon whose last name is Peter was staying there.
051019 And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are looking for you.
051020 Therefore arise and go down and go with them without doubting, for I have sent them.
051021 And going down to the men, those sent to him from Cornelius, Peter said, Behold, I am the one you are seeking. For what reason have you come?
051022 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man and one who fears God, and one of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear words from you.
051023 Then he called them in and lodged them . And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brothers from Joppa went with him.
051024 And the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
051025 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped.
051026 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up! I also am a man myself.
051027 And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together.
051028 And he said to them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man, a Jew to keep company with or to come near to one of another nation. But God has shown me not to call any man common or unclean.
051029 Therefore I came without complaint, being sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me.
051030 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour. And at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing.
051031 And he said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your merciful deeds have been remembered before God.
051032 Therefore send to Joppa and call here Simon whose last name is Peter, he is staying in the house of Simon, a tanner by the seaside; who, when he comes, shall speak to you.
051033 Therefore I immediately sent to you, and you have done well to come. Now therefore we are all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded you by God.
051034 Then Peter opened his mouth and said, Truly I see that God is no respecter of persons;
051035 but in every nation he who fears Him and works righteousness is accepted with Him.
051036 You know the word which God sent to the sons of Israel, preaching the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all!);
051037 that word which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed;
051038 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and He went about doing good, and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with Him.
051039 And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed Him and hanged Him on a tree;
051040 but God raised Him up the third day and showed Him openly,
051041 not to all the people, but to witnesses hand-picked before by God, even to us who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.
051042 And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained of God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.
051043 All the prophets give witness to Him, that through His name whoever believes in Him shall receive remission of sins.
051044 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those hearing the Word.
051045 And those of the circumcision, who believed (as many as came with Peter), were astonished because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the nations also.
051046 For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,
051047 Can anyone forbid water that these, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we, should not be baptized?
051048 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they begged him to stay certain days.
051101 And the apostles and brothers who were in Judea heard that the nations had also received the Word of God.
051102 And when Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him,
051103 saying, You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them.
051104 But Peter related the matter from the beginning and explained it by order to them, saying,
051105 I was in the city of Joppa praying. And in an ecstasy I saw a vision, a certain vessel like a sheet coming down, let down from the sky by four corners. And it came even to me.
051106 When I had fastened my eyes on it , I looked and saw four-footed animals of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and birds of the heaven.
051107 And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter! Kill and eat!
051108 But I said, Not so, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.
051109 But the voice answered me again from the heaven, What God has made clean, you do not call common.
051110 And this was done three times , and all were drawn up again into the heaven.
051111 And behold, immediately three men stood at the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.
051112 And the Spirit told me to go with them, not discriminating. And these six brothers went with me, and we entered the man's house.
051113 And he declared to us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa and call for Simon whose last name is Peter,
051114 who will tell you words by which you and all your house shall be saved.
051115 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
051116 And I remembered the Word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
051117 If God gave to them the same gift as to us, they having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to prevent God?
051118 When they heard these things, they were silent and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted repentance to life to the nations.
051119 Then, indeed, they who were scattered abroad by the persecution that rose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the Word to no one except the Jews.
051120 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene; who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.
051121 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.
051122 And the Word was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem. And they sent out Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch;
051123 who was glad when he had come and had seen the grace of God. And he exhorted all with purpose of heart to remain near to the Lord.
051124 For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and faith. And many people were added to the Lord.
051125 And Barnabas went out to Tarsus to seek Saul.
051126 And finding him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened to them a whole year they were assembled in the church. And they taught a considerable crowd. And the disciples were first called Christian in Antioch.
051127 And in these days prophets from Jerusalem came to Antioch.
051128 And one of them named Agabus stood up and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine over the world (which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar).
051129 And the disciples, as any were prospered, determined each of them to send for ministry to those brothers who lived in Judea,
051130 which they also did, sending to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
051201 And at that time Herod the king threw on his hands to oppress some of those of the church.
051202 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
051203 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he went further to seize Peter also. (And they were days of Unleavened Bread .)
051204 And capturing him , he put him in prison, and delivered him to four sets of four soldiers to keep him; intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.
051205 Then, indeed, Peter was kept in prison. But earnest prayer was made to God for him by the church.
051206 And when Herod was about to bring him out, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Also guards were keeping the prison before the door.
051207 And behold! An angel of the Lord stood by, and a light shone in the building. And striking Peter's side, he raised him up, saying, Rise up quickly! And his chains fell off his hands.
051208 And the angel said to him, Gird yourself and put on your sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Throw your robe around you and follow me.
051209 And he went out and followed him. And he did not know that this happening through the angel was true, but thought he saw a vision.
051210 When they were past the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord. And they went out and passed on through one street. And immediately the angel departed from him.
051211 And having come to himself, Peter said, Now I know surely that the Lord has sent His angel and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
051212 And thinking about it , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose last name was Mark; where many had gathered together to pray.
051213 And as Peter knocked at the door of the porch, a girl named Rhoda came to listen.
051214 And when she knew Peter's voice, she did not open the porch because of gladness, but running in she reported Peter was standing before the porch.
051215 And they said to her, You are mad. But she kept on saying that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.
051216 But Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened and saw him, they were amazed.
051217 But, waving to them with his hand to be quiet, he declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go tell these things to James and to the brothers. And he departed and went into another place.
051218 And day coming, there was not a little stir among the soldiers, saying, What, then, became of Peter.
051219 And searching for him, and not finding him , examining the guards, Herod commanded them to be led away to death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed.
051220 And Herod was in bitter hostility with the men of Tyre and Sidon. But they came to him with one accord and, having made Blastus (who had charge of the king's bedroom) their friend, desired peace, because their country was fed by the king's country .
051221 And on a certain day, Herod sat on his throne, dressed in royal clothing, and made a speech to them.
051222 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god and not of a man!
051223 And immediately the angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory. And he was eaten by worms and gave up the spirit.
051224 But the Word of God grew and increased.
051225 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled the ministry, having taken with them John, whose last name was Mark.
051301 And in Antioch some among the existing church were prophets and teachers. (such as Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.
051302 As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, So, then, separate Barnabas and Saul to Me for the work to which I have called them.
051303 Then having fasted and prayed and laid hands on them, they let them go.
051304 Then these indeed sent out by the Holy Spirit went down to Seleucia. And from there they sailed to Cyprus.
051305 And when they were at Salamis, they announced the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they also had John as an assistant.
051306 And when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain conjurer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-jesus;
051307 who was with the proconsul of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. He called for Barnabas and Saul and asked to hear the Word of God.
051308 But Elymas the conjurer (for so his name is, if translated) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
051309 Then Saul (who is also Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him
051310 and said, O son of the Devil, full of all deceit and all craftiness, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?
051311 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you. And you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a while. And immediately a mist and a darkness fell on him, and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
051312 Then, seeing the thing happening, the proconsul believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
051313 And Paul and those around him sailed from Paphos and came to Perga of Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
051314 But going through from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down.
051315 And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brothers, if you have any word of comfort for the people, speak.
051316 And rising up and signaling with his hand, Paul said, Men, Israelites, and those fearing God, listen.
051317 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people in their residency in the land of Egypt, and He brought them out of it with a high arm.
051318 And about the time of forty years He tenderly bore them in the wilderness.
051319 And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave their land to them as an inheritance.
051320 And after that He gave them judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
051321 And afterward they asked for a king. And God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
051322 And when He had removed him, He raised up David to them to be their king; to whom He also witnessed and said, I have found David the son of Jesse to be a man after My own heart, who shall fulfill all My will.
051323 Of this man's seed God has raised to Israel, according to His promise, a Savior, Jesus;
051324 John having before proclaimed the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel, before His coming.
051325 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Who do you think that I am? I am not He . But behold, One comes after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.
051326 Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, the word of this salvation is sent to you.
051327 For those living in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not having known this One, and the voices of the prophets being read throughout every sabbath, condemning Him , they fulfilled the Scriptures .
051328 And finding not one cause of death in Him , they begged Pilate to do away with Him.
051329 And when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, taking Him down from the tree, they laid Him in a tomb.
051330 But God raised Him from the dead,
051331 who appeared for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people.
051332 And we preach the gospel to you, the promise made to the fathers,
051333 this God has fulfilled to us their children, raising up Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, "You are My Son, this day I have begotten You."
051334 And that He raised Him up from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He spoke in this way: "I will give you the holy promises of David."
051335 Therefore he also says in another psalm , "You shall not allow Your Holy One to see corruption."
051336 For after he had served his own generation by the will of God, David fell asleep and was added to his fathers and saw corruption.
051337 But He whom God raised again saw no corruption.
051338 Therefore be it known to you, men, brothers, that through this One the forgiveness of sins is announced to you.
051339 And by Him all who believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
051340 Therefore beware lest that come on you which is spoken of in the prophets:
051341 "Behold, you despisers, and marvel, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no way believe, though a man declare it to you."
051342 And the Jews having gone out of the synagogue, the nations begged that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
051343 And the synagogue being broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
051344 And on the coming sabbath day almost all the city came together to hear the Word of God.
051345 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy and contradicted those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
051346 But speaking boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first. But since indeed you put it far from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the nations.
051347 For so the Lord has commanded us, saying , "I have set You to be a light of the nations, for salvation to the end of the earth."
051348 And hearing, the nations rejoiced and glorified the Word of the Lord. And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
051349 And the Word of the Lord was carried throughout all the country.
051350 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief ones of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas. And they threw them out of their borders.
051351 But shaking the dust of their feet off on them, they came into Iconium.
051352 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
051401 And it happened in Iconium, they both went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke so as a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
051402 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the nations and made them evil-hearted against the brothers.
051403 Therefore they stayed a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who bore witness to the word of His grace, giving miracles and wonders to be done by their hands.
051404 But the multitude of the city was divided. And part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
051405 And when there was an assault made by both the nations and the Jews, with their rulers, in order to insult and to stone them,
051406 they were aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the country around them.
051407 And there they were preaching the gospel.
051408 And a certain man was sitting in Lystra, without strength in the feet, being lame from his mother's womb, who never had walked.
051409 This one heard Paul speaking; and Paul , looking intently at him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
051410 said with a loud voice, Stand up on your feet! And he leaped and walked.
051411 And seeing what Paul did, the crowd lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian, The gods have come down to us, becoming like men.
051412 And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.
051413 And the priest of Jupiter, being before their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, wishing to sacrifice with the crowds.
051414 But hearing this , the apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their clothes and ran in among the people, crying out
051415 and saying, Men, why do you do these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preaching the gospel to you to turn you from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things in them;
051416 who in past generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways.
051417 And yet He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving rain and fruitful season to us from heaven, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
051418 And saying these things, they scarcely stopped the people from sacrificing to them.
051419 And Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, who, having persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, they drew him out of the city, supposing him to have died.
051420 But the disciples surrounding him, he rose up and came into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
051421 And preaching the gospel to that city, and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,
051422 confirming the souls of the disciples, calling on them to continue in the faith and that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God.
051423 And having hand-picked elders for them in every church, and had prayed with fastings, they commended them to the Lord into whom they believed.
051424 And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
051425 And speaking the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
051426 And from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
051427 And having arrived, and gathering the church they related all that God had done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith to the nations.
051428 And they stayed there not a little time with the disciples.
051501 And certain ones who came down from Judea taught the brothers, saying , Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.
051502 Therefore dissension and not a little disputation occurring by Paul and Barnabas, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.
051503 And indeed being set forward by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the nations. And they caused great joy to all the brothers.
051504 And arriving in Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and by the apostles and elders. And they declared all things that God had done with them.
051505 But some of those from the sect of the Pharisees, having believed, rose up, saying, It was necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
051506 And the apostles and elders were assembled to see about this matter.
051507 And after much disputing, Peter rose up and said to them, Men, brothers, you recognize that from ancient days God chose among us that through my mouth the nations should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
051508 And God, who knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit even as to us.
051509 And He put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
051510 Now therefore why do you tempt God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples, a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
051511 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, according to which manner they also believed.
051512 And all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders God had worked among the nations through them.
051513 And after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.
051514 Even as Simon has declared how God at the first visited the nations to take out of them a people for His name.
051515 And the words of the prophets agree to this; as it is written,
051516 "After this I will return and will build again the tabernacle of David which has fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up,
051517 so those men who are left might seek after the Lord, and all the nations on whom My name has been called, says the Lord, who does all these things."
051518 All His works are known to God from eternity.
051519 Therefore my judgment is that we do not trouble those who have turned to God from among the nations,
051520 but that we write to them that they should abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.
051521 For Moses from ages past has those in every city proclaiming him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
051522 Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas, whose last name was Barsabas; and Silas, chief men among the brothers.
051523 And they wrote these things by their hand: The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers, from the nations in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.
051524 Because we have heard that certain ones who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, Be circumcised and keep the law! (to whom we gave no such command);
051525 it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
051526 men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
051527 Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also announce to you the same things by word.
051528 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things:
051529 that you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which, if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Be prospered.
051530 Then indeed they being let go, they came to Antioch. And gathering the multitude, they delivered the letter.
051531 And when they had read it , they rejoiced at the comfort.
051532 And Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words and confirmed them .
051533 And remaining for a time, they were let go in peace from the brothers to the apostles.
051534 But it pleased Silas to remain there.
051535 Also Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the gospel, the Word of the Lord, with many others also.
051536 And some days afterward, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have announced the Word of the Lord, to see how they are holding to it.
051537 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, he being called Mark.
051538 But Paul thought it well not to take that one with them , he having withdrawn from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work.
051539 Then there was sharp feeling, so as to separate them from each other. And taking Mark, Barnabas sailed to Cyprus.
051540 But choosing Silas, Paul went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God,
051541 passing through Syria and Cilicia, making the churches strong.
051601 And he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a woman who was a Jewess and who believed. But his father was a Greek.
051602 He was well reported of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.
051603 Paul wanted him to go with him, and taking him he circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
051604 And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to them the commandments to keep, the ones that were ordained by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.
051605 Then indeed the churches were established in the faith and increased in number daily.
051606 And coming through the Phrygian and the Galatian region; and by the Holy Spirit being forbidden to speak the Word in Asia;
051607 having come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia. But the Spirit did not allow them.
051608 Then passing by Mysia, they came down into Troas.
051609 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A certain man of Macedonia stood, begging him, saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us!
051610 And after he saw the vision, we immediately tried to go into Macedonia, gathering that the Lord had called us in order to preach the gospel to them.
051611 Then having set sail from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;
051612 and from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we continued spending time in that city some days.
051613 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was usually made. And we sat down and spoke to the women who came together there .
051614 And a certain woman named Lydia heard us, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God; whose heart the Lord opened, so that she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul.
051615 And when she was baptized, she and her household, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay. And she constrained us.
051616 And as we went to prayer, it happened that a certain girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by divining.
051617 The same followed Paul and us and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who are announcing to us the way of salvation.
051618 And she did this many days. But being distressed, and turning to the demonic spirit, Paul said, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! And it came out in that hour.
051619 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain went out, having seized Paul and Silas, they dragged them to the market before the rulers.
051620 And bringing them near to the judges, they said, These men, being Jews, are exceedingly troubling our city.
051621 And they teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.
051622 And the crowd rose up against them. And tearing off their clothes, the judges ordered them to be flogged.
051623 And after laying on them many stripes, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailor to keep them safely;
051624 who, having received such a command, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.
051625 And toward midnight Paul and Silas prayed and praised God in a hymn. And the prisoners listened to them.
051626 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds were loosened.
051627 And being awakened, and seeing the doors of the prison being open, drawing a sword, the jailer was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
051628 But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.
051629 Then asking for a light he rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
051630 And leading them outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
051631 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved, and your household.
051632 And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his household.
051633 And taking them in that hour of the night, he washed from their stripes. And he was baptized, he and all his, immediately.
051634 And bringing them up to the house, he set a table before them and rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.
051635 And day coming, the judges sent the floggers, saying, Let those men go.
051636 And the jailer spoke these words to Paul: The judges have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.
051637 But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly, men who are Romans and uncondemned, they threw us into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! But coming themselves, let them bring us out.
051638 And the floggers reported these words to the judges. And hearing that they were Romans, they were afraid.
051639 And coming they begged them . And bringing them out, they asked them to depart out of the city.
051640 And going out from the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia. And seeing the brothers, they comforted them and departed.
051701 And traveling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
051702 And according to Paul's custom, he went in to them and reasoned with them out of the Scriptures on three sabbaths,
051703 opening and setting forth that Christ must have suffered, and to have risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is Christ.
051704 And some of them believed and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, both a great multitude of the worshiping Greeks, and not a few of the chief women.
051705 But the disobeying Jews becoming jealous, and having taken aside some wicked men of the market-loafers, and gathering a crowd, they set all the city in an uproar. And coming on the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the mob.
051706 And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brothers before the city judges, crying, These who have turned the world upside down have come here too,
051707 whom Jason has received. And these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.
051708 And hearing these things, they troubled the crowd and the city judge.
051709 And taking security from Jason and from the rest, they let them go.
051710 And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. They, when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.
051711 And these were more noble than those of Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily to see if those things were so .
051712 Therefore many of them believed, and quite a few of honorable Greek women and men.
051713 But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the Word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the people.
051714 And then immediately the brothers sent Paul away to go towards the sea, but both Silas and Timothy stayed there.
051715 And those conducting Paul brought him to Athens. And receiving a command to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.
051716 But awaiting them in Athens, Paul's spirit was pained within him, seeing the city full of idols.
051717 Then indeed he addressed the Jews in the synagogue, and those worshiping, and daily in the market, to those happening to be there .
051718 And certain philosophers from the Epicureans and from the Stoics met him. And some said, What will this babbler say? And others said, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons (because he preached Jesus and the resurrection to them).
051719 And taking hold of him, they led him to the Areopagus, saying, Are we able to know what is this new doctrine of which you speak?
051720 For you bring certain strange things to our ears, therefore we are minded to know what these things mean.
051721 (For all the Athenians and strangers who were there spent their time in nothing else except to tell or to hear something newer.)
051722 And standing in the middle of the Areopagus, Paul said, Men, Athenians, I see that you are fearful of gods in everything.
051723 For as I passed by and saw the things you worship, I also found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Not knowing then whom you worship, I make Him known to you.
051724 The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,
051725 nor is served with men's hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives life and breath and all things to all.
051726 And He has made all nations of men of one blood to dwell on all the face of the earth, ordaining fore-appointed seasons and boundaries of their dwelling,
051727 to seek the Lord, if perhaps they might feel after Him and find Him, though indeed He is not far from each one of us.
051728 For in Him we live and move and have our being, as also certain of your own poets have said, For we are also His offspring.
051729 Then being offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like gold or silver or stone, engraved by art and man's imagination.
051730 Truly, then, God overlooking the times of ignorance, now He strictly commands all men everywhere to repent,
051731 because He has appointed a day in which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He appointed, having given proof to all by raising Him from the dead.
051732 And hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked; and others said, We will hear you again concerning this.
051733 And so Paul departed from among them.
051734 But certain men joined themselves to him and believed; among whom were Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
051801 And after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.
051802 And finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) Paul came to them.
051803 And because he was of the same trade, he stayed and worked with them; for they were tentmakers by occupation.
051804 And he reasoned in the synagogue on every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.
051805 And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.
051806 And they resisting and blaspheming, shaking his garment, he said to them, Your blood is on your own heads. I am pure from it . From now on I will go to the nations.
051807 And he departed from there and entered into the house of one named Justus, one worshiping God, whose house was next to the synagogue.
051808 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house. And hearing this, many of the Corinthians believed and were baptized.
051809 And the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and be not silent.
051810 For I am with you, and no one shall set on you to hurt you, for I have many people in this city.
051811 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.
051812 But Gallio being pro-consul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rushed against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,
051813 saying, This one persuades men to worship God contrary to the Law.
051814 And Paul being about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed then, it was anything wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, according to reason I would endure you.
051815 But if it is a question of a word and names, and of your law, you look to it . For I do not wish to be a judge of such things.
051816 And he drove them from the judgment seat.
051817 And all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio did not care for any of these things.
051818 And Paul having remained many days more, taking leave of the brothers, he sailed from there into Syria. And Priscilla and Aquila were with him. And Paul had shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.
051819 And he came to Ephesus and left them there. But he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
051820 And they asking him to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent
051821 but took leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that is coming in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you, God willing. And he sailed from Ephesus.
051822 And when he had landed at Caesarea and had gone up to greet the church, he went down to Antioch.
051823 And after he had spent some time there , he departed and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
051824 And a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.
051825 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught the things of the Lord diligently, knowing only the baptism of John.
051826 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla heard him, and they took him and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.
051827 And intending to pass into Achaia, being encouraged, the brothers wrote to the disciples to welcome him; who, having arrived, very much helped those who had believed through grace.
051828 For he mightily confuted the Jews publicly, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
051901 And it happened in the time Apollos was at Corinth, Paul was passing through the higher parts to Ephesus. And finding certain disciples,
051902 he said to them, Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? And they said to him, We did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit is.
051903 And he said to them, Then to what were you baptized? And they said, To John's baptism.
051904 And Paul said, John truly baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe into Him coming after him, that is, into Jesus Christ.
051905 And hearing, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
051906 And as Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.
051907 And all of the men were about twelve.
051908 And going into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
051909 But when some were hardened and did not believe, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
051910 And this happened over two years, so that all those living in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
051911 And God did works of power through the hands of Paul,
051912 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin being brought onto the sick, the diseases were released, and the evil spirits went out of them.
051913 And certain from the strolling Jews, exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.
051914 And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.
051915 But answering the evil spirit said, Jesus I know, and I comprehend Paul, but who are you?
051916 And the man in whom the evil spirit resided leaped on them, and overcoming them he was strong against them, so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.
051917 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks who lived at Ephesus, and fear fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
051918 And many who believed came and confessed and showed their deeds.
051919 Also many of those practicing the curious arts, bringing together the books, burned them before all. And they counted the prices of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
051920 So the Word of God grew mightily and prevailed.
051921 After these things were ended, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have come there, I must also see Rome.
051922 And sending into Macedonia two who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he stayed in Asia for a time.
051923 And about that time there was not a little a stir about the Way.
051924 For a certain silversmith named Demetrius was making silver temples of Artemis, providing not a little trade for the craftsmen.
051925 And assembling the workmen about such things, he said, Men, you know that from this trade is our wealth.
051926 And you see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost all Asia, this Paul having persuaded, he has perverted a huge crowd, saying that those which are made with hands are no gods.
051927 And not only is this dangerous to us, our share coming into dispute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted for nothing, and her magnificence is also about to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.
051928 And hearing, and becoming full of anger, they cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.
051929 And all the city was filled with confusion. And they rushed with one accord to the theater, keeping a firm grip on Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.
051930 And Paul intending to go in to the mob, the disciples did not allow him.
051931 And some of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, begging him not to give himself into the theater.
051932 Then indeed others cried out, some other things; for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.
051933 And they dragged Alexander forward out of the crowd, the Jews thrusting him forward. And waving his hand Alexander desired to defend himself to the mob.
051934 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for two hours' time , Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
051935 And quieting the crowd, the town clerk said, Men, Ephesians! What one of you does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Artemis, and of That Fallen from the Sky?
051936 Since these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.
051937 For you have brought these men, who are neither robbers of churches nor blasphemers of your goddess.
051938 Therefore if Demetrius and those craftsmen with him truly have a matter against anyone, the court days are kept , and there are proconsuls. Let them plead against one another.
051939 But if you ask anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
051940 For we are in danger to be accused of revolt concerning today; there being no cause by which we may give an account of this crowding together.
051941 And saying these things, he dismissed the assembly.
052001 And after the uproar had ceased, calling the disciples and greeting them , Paul left to go into Macedonia.
052002 And passing through those parts, and exhorting them with much speech, he came into Greece.
052003 And spending three months there , there being a plot against him by the Jews, being about to sail into Syria, he proposed to return through Macedonia.
052004 And Sopater of Berea accompanied him into Asia, and Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus as far as Asia.
052005 Going before, these waited for us at Troas.
052006 And after the days of Unleavened Bread , we sailed away from Philippi and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.
052007 And on the first of the sabbaths, the disciples having been assembled to break bread, being about to depart on the morrow, Paul reasoned to them. And he continued his speech until midnight.
052008 And there were many lights in the upper room where they were assembled.
052009 And a certain young man named Eutychus was sitting on the window sill, Paul reasoning for a longer time, being overborne by sleep, he fell down from the third floor, and was taken up dead.
052010 And Paul went down and fell on him, and embracing him said, Do not be terrified, for his soul is in him.
052011 And going up, and breaking bread, and tasting, and conversing over a long time , until daybreak, he went out thus.
052012 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
052013 And going ahead onto the ship, we sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul; for so he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot.
052014 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.
052015 And we sailed from there and came the next day across from Chios. And the next day we arrived at Samos, and we stayed at Trogyllium. And the next day we came to Miletus.
052016 For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not lose time in Asia; for, if it were possible for him, he hastened to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
052017 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church.
052018 And when they had come to him, he said to them, You know how I was with you at all times, from the first day I arrived in Asia,
052019 serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and many tears and temptations happening to me through the plots of the Jews;
052020 and how I kept back nothing that was profitable, but have shown you and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,
052021 testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
052022 And now, behold, I am going bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall happen to me there,
052023 except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
052024 But none of these things move me, neither do I count my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus Christ , to testify fully the gospel of the grace of God.
052025 And now, behold, I know that you all will see my face no more, among whom I went proclaiming the kingdom of God.
052026 Therefore I testify to you on this day that I am pure from the blood of all.
052027 For I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God.
052028 Therefore take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to feed the church of God which He has purchased with His own blood.
052029 For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
052030 Also men shall arise from your own selves, speaking perverse things in order to draw disciples away after them.
052031 Therefore watch and remember that for the time of three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.
052032 And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
052033 I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel.
052034 Yea, you yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to those who were with me.
052035 I have shown you all things, that working in this way we ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
052036 And saying these things, kneeling, he prayed with them all.
052037 And there was much weeping of all, and falling on the neck of Paul, they ardently kissed him,
052038 grieving most of all over the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they went with him to the ship.
052101 And it happened when it was time to sail, we having been torn away from them, running direct we came to Cos; and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
052102 And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, going on board, we set sail.
052103 And sighting Cyprus, and leaving it on the left, we sailed into Syria, and came down to Tyre. For the ship was to unload its cargo there.
052104 And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days; who said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
052105 But when it was time to finish the days, going out, we traveled on. And they with all the women and children went with us as far as outside the city. And we kneeled down on the shore and prayed.
052106 And giving parting greetings to one another, we went up into the ship; and they returned to their own things.
052107 And finishing the voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais. And greeting the brothers, we stayed with them one day.
052108 And the next day those around him going out, Paul came to Caesarea. And entering the house of Philip the evangelist, he being of the seven, we stayed with him.
052109 And there were four virgin daughters to this one, who prophesied.
052110 And as we stayed more days, a certain prophet from Judea named Agabus came down.
052111 And coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, and binding his hands and feet, he said, The Holy Spirit says these things : So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose belt this is, and will deliver him into the hands of the nations.
052112 And when we heard these things, both we and those of the place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
052113 Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
052114 And he not being persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done .
052115 And after those days, making ready, we went up to Jerusalem.
052116 Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing Mnason, a certain Cypriot, an old disciple with whom we were to lodge.
052117 And we being in Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.
052118 And on the next day Paul went with us to James. And all the elders were present.
052119 And having greeted them, he related one by one what things God had done among the nations by his ministry.
052120 And hearing, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe, and they are all zealous of the law.
052121 And they are informed concerning you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the nations to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after the customs.
052122 What is it therefore? At all events a multitude will come together, for they will hear that you have come.
052123 Therefore do this, what we say to you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves;
052124 taking them, be purified with them, and be at expense for them, so that they may shave their heads. And all may know that what they have been told about you is nothing, but you yourself also walk orderly and keep the Law.
052125 And as to the nations who believe, we joined in writing, judging them to observe no such things, except only that they keep themselves from both idol sacrifice, and blood, and a thing strangled, and from fornication.
052126 Then taking the men on the next day, being purified with them, Paul went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of the purification, until an offering should be offered for each of them.
052127 And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews who were from Asia, having seen him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd and laid hands on him,
052128 crying out, Men, Israelites, help! This is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people and the Law and this place. And even he brought Greeks into the temple and has polluted this holy place.
052129 (For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city before, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
052130 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together. And laying hands on Paul, they drew him outside of the temple. And immediately the doors were shut.
052131 And as they were seeking to kill him, the news came to the chiliarch of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
052132 He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, they quit beating Paul.
052133 Then going near, the chiliarch laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains. And he demanded who he was and what he had done.
052134 And others cried something else in the crowd, and not being able to know the certainty on account of the uproar, he commanded him to be carried into the fortress.
052135 And when he came on the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.
052136 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him!
052137 And as Paul was about to be led into the fortress, he said to the chiliarch, Is it lawful for me to say a thing to you? And he said, Do you know Greek?
052138 Then are you not the Egyptian who before these days caused a riot, and led four thousand men of the assassins out into the wilderness?
052139 But Paul said, I am a man, a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no small city. And I beseech you, allow me to speak to the people.
052140 And he allowing him, standing on the stairs, Paul signaled with his hand to the people. And much silence taking place, he spoke in the Hebrew dialect, saying:
052201 Men, brothers and fathers! Hear my defense now to you.
052202 And hearing that he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, they all the more kept silence. And he said,
052203 I am truly a man, a Jew born in Tarsus in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the exactness of the law of the fathers, being a zealous one of God, as you all are today.
052204 I persecuted this Way as far as death, binding and delivering both men and women into prisons;
052205 as also the high priest bears witness to me, and all the elderhood. And receiving letters from them to the brothers, I traveled into Damascus indeed to lead those being bound to Jerusalem, in order that they might be punished.
052206 And it happened to me, traveling and drawing near to Damascus: suddenly, about midday, a great light out of the heaven shone around me.
052207 And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?
052208 And I answered, Who are you, lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.
052209 And they who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid. But they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me.
052210 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise and go into Damascus. And there it shall be told you all things which are appointed for you to do.
052211 And I did not see, because of the glory of that light; being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.
052212 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, testified to by all the Jews who lived there ,
052213 coming to me and standing by, said to me, Brother Saul, look up! And the same hour I looked up on him.
052214 And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you to know His will and to see the Just One, and to hear a voice out of His mouth.
052215 For you shall be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
052216 And now what do you intend? Arise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
052217 And it happened to me, I returning to Jerusalem and praying in the temple, I became in an ecstasy.
052218 And I saw Him say to me, Hurry and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.
052219 And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating those who believed on You throughout the synagogues.
052220 And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was poured out, I also was standing by and consenting to his death, and holding the garments of those who killed him.
052221 And He said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the nations.
052222 And they listened to him until this word, and then they lifted up their voice, saying, Take such a one from the earth! For it is not fitting that he should live.
052223 And as they shouted and tore their garments, and threw dust into the air,
052224 the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying for him to be examined by scourging, so that he might know why they cried out so against him.
052225 And as they stretched him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?
052226 And hearing, coming near the centurion reported to the chiliarch, saying, Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.
052227 And coming up the chiliarch said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And He said, Yes.
052228 And the chiliarch answered, With a great sum I bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was even born free .
052229 Then immediately, those being about to examine him stood away from him. And the chiliarch also was afraid, fully knowing that he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.
052230 On the next day, he desiring to know with certainty why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrin to appear. And bringing Paul down, he set him among them.
052301 And looking earnestly on the sanhedrin, Paul said, Men, brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
052302 And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
052303 Then Paul said to him, God shall strike you, whitened wall! For do you sit judging me according to the Law, and against law command me to be stricken?
052304 And they who stood by him said, Do you revile God's high priest?
052305 Then Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest; for it is written, "You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people."
052306 But when Paul saw that the one part were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees, he cried out in the sanhedrin, Men! Brothers! I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I am being judged because of the hope and resurrection of the dead.
052307 And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.
052308 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.
052309 And there arose a great cry. And the scribes who were on the Pharisees' side arose and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
052310 And dissension arising, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him from among them by force, and to bring him into the fortress.
052311 And the following night the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good cheer, Paul, for as you have testified of Me in Jerusalem, so you also must bear witness at Rome.
052312 And when it became day, some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
052313 And they who made this conspiracy were more than forty.
052314 And they came to the chief priests and elders and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.
052315 Now therefore you, with the sanhedrin, inform the chiliarch that he bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you would inquire something more perfectly regarding him. And we are ready to put him to death before he comes near.
052316 And hearing of the ambush, Paul's sister's son, having come near, and entering into the fortress, he reported to Paul.
052317 And calling one of the centurions, Paul said, Bring this young man to the chiliarch, for he has a certain thing to tell him.
052318 So he took him and brought him to the chiliarch and said, Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to say to you.
052319 And laying hold of his hand, and drawing aside privately, the chiliarch asked him , What is it that you have to tell me?
052320 And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they would inquire something more exactly about him.
052321 But do not yield to them, for there are more than forty men of them lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, looking for a promise from you.
052322 So the chiliarch sent away the young man commanding, Tell no one that you have shown these things to me.
052323 And he called two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night.
052324 And provide animals, so that they may set Paul on them and bring him to Felix the governor.
052325 And he wrote a letter in this way:
052326 Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.
052327 This man was taken by the Jews and would have been killed by them. Then I came with an army and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
052328 And being minded to know the charge for which they accused him, I brought him down to their sanhedrin;
052329 whom I found be accused of questions of their law, and having no charge worthy of death or of bonds.
052330 And it being revealed to me that a plot against the man was about to be executed by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, commanding his accusers also to say before you what they had against him. Farewell.
052331 Then, indeed, taking up Paul, as it was commanded them, the soldiers brought him by night to Antipatris.
052332 And on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the fortress.
052333 And when they had come to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul before him also.
052334 And when the governor had read the letter , he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that he was from Cilicia,
052335 he said, I will hear you when your accusers have also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.
052401 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator, Tertullus, who made a statement to the governor against Paul.
052402 And being called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying,
052403 Since we enjoy great quietness by you, and very worthy deeds are done to this nation due to your forethought, in everything and everywhere, most noble Felix, we accept with all thankfulness.
052404 But that I not hinder you further, I beseech you to hear us briefly in your fairness.
052405 For we have found this man pestilent, and moving rebellion among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,
052406 who also attempted to profane the temple, whom we took and would have judged according to our law.
052407 But the chiliarch Lysias came with much force, taking him away out of our hands,
052408 commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him, you yourself may know about all these things of which we accuse him.
052409 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
052410 But the governor motioning to him to speak, Paul answered; Understanding you as being a judge of this nation many years, I cheerfully defend myself as to the things concerning myself.
052411 You can know that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
052412 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, nor making a gathering of a crowd; not even in the synagogues, nor throughout the city.
052413 Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
052414 But I confess this to you, that after the Way which they call heresy, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets.
052415 And I have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
052416 And in this I exercise myself, always to have a blameless conscience toward God and men.
052417 And after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation.
052418 Among which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor with tumult.
052419 These ought to be present before you and to accuse me, if they have anything against me.
052420 Or else let these themselves say if they have found anything unjust in me while I stood before the sanhedrin,
052421 unless it may be for this one voice that I cried out standing among them, that concerning a resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you today.
052422 And having heard these things, Felix put them off, knowing more accurately of the Way, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch has come down, I will examine the things concerning you.
052423 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and not to forbid anyone of his own to minister or come to him.
052424 Then after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
052425 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and the Judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, Go for this time, but taking time later, I will call for you.
052426 He also hoped that silver would be given him by Paul, that he might free him. Therefore he also frequently sent for him and talked with him.
052427 But after two years Felix welcomed a successor, Porcius Festus. And wishing to show a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.
052501 Then entering the province, after three days Festus went from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
052502 And the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him
052503 asking a favor against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem, making a plot to kill him on way.
052504 Then indeed Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea; he himself would depart shortly.
052505 Then he said, those having power among you may go down with me . If there is a thing amiss in this man, let them accuse him.
052506 And staying among them more than ten days, going down to Caesarea, on the next day sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.
052507 And he having come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around and brought many charges against Paul, which they could not prove.
052508 Defending himself, Paul said, Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything.
052509 But Festus, wanting to please the Jews, answered Paul and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me about these things?
052510 But Paul said, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.
052511 For if I am an offender or have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is nothing of which these accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.
052512 Then conferring with the sanhedrin, Festus answered, You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go.
052513 And after some days king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.
052514 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause to the king, saying, A certain man has been left in bonds by Felix,
052515 about whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , desiring judgment against him.
052516 To them I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before he being accused may have the accusers face to face, and have had freedom to answer for himself concerning the accusation.
052517 Therefore, when they had come here, without any delay I sat on the judgment seat the next day and commanded the man to be brought,
052518 about whom, standing up, the accusers brought against him no charge of which I suspected,
052519 but they had certain questions about their own demon-worship, and about a certain Jesus dying, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
052520 And because I was perplexed about this question, I asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters.
052521 But Paul having appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be held until I might send him to Caesar.
052522 And Agrippa said to Festus, I also would like to hear the man myself. And he said, Tomorrow you shall hear him.
052523 And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp and had entered into the auditorium with both the chiliarchs and principal men of the city, also Festus commanding, Paul was brought out.
052524 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all those men present with us, you see this one about whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
052525 But I had perceived nothing he had committed worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I determined to send him,
052526 about whom I have no certain thing to write of him to my lord. Therefore I brought him before you, and especially before you, O king Agrippa, so that, after examination is made, I might have something to write.
052527 For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the charges against him.
052601 And Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then stretching out his hand, Paul made a defense:
052602 Concerning all of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I think myself happy being about to make defense before you today,
052603 you being especially expert in all customs and questions among the Jews. Therefore I beseech you to hear me patiently.
052604 Truly, then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth, which was at first among my own nation at Jerusalem,
052605 who knew me from the first, if they would testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
052606 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made to our fathers by God,
052607 to which promise our twelve tribes hope to attain, serving God fervently night and day. For the sake of this hope, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
052608 Why is it thought a thing incredible with you that God raises the dead?
052609 I truly thought within myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth,
052610 which I also did in Jerusalem. And I shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests. And they being put to death, I cast a vote.
052611 And I punished them often in every synagogue; I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly furious against them, I persecuted them even to the outside cities.
052612 In which pursuit also traveling to Damascus with authority and power of decision from the chief priests,
052613 at midday, along the highway, O king, I and those with me saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun; shining around me.
052614 And all of us falling to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
052615 And I said, Who are you, lord? And He said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.
052616 But rise and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of what you saw, and in what I shall appear to you;
052617 delivering you from the people and the nations, to whom I now send you
052618 in order to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, so that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.
052619 After this, king Agrippa, I did not disobey the heavenly vision.
052620 But to those first in Damascus, and Jerusalem, and to all the country of Judea, and to the nations, I made known the command to repent and to turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance
052621 Because of these things, having caught me in the temple, The Jews tried to kill me .
052622 Then having obtained help from God, I stand until this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said was going to happen;
052623 whether the Christ was liable to suffer, whether first by a resurrection of the dead He was going to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.
052624 And he defending himself with these things, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you rave! Your many letters turn you to insanity.
052625 But he said, Not to insanity, most noble Festus, but I speak words of truth and sanity.
052626 For the king understands about these things, to whom I speak, even being bold of speech. For I am persuaded that not any of these things are hidden from him, nothing. For the doing of this was not in a corner.
052627 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.
052628 And Agrippa said to Paul, Do you persuade me to be a Christian in but a little?
052629 And Paul said, I would pray to God, both in a little and in much, that not only you, but also all hearing me today to become as I also am, except for these bonds.
052630 And he having spoken this, the king and the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them rose up.
052631 And withdrawing, they spoke with one another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
052632 And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar.
052701 And when it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' cohort.
052702 And boarding a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail alongside Asian places, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, being with us.
052703 And on the next day we were landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul courteously and gave him liberty to go to his friends to receive care.
052704 And setting sail from there, we sailed close to Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
052705 And sailing over the sea against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra of Lycia.
052706 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, and he put us on it.
052707 And sailing slowly many days and with difficulty, coming abreast of Cnidus; the wind not allowing us; we sailed close to Crete, across from Salmone.
052708 And coasting along with difficulty, we came to a place named Fair Havens, near which was a city, Lasea.
052709 And much time having been used up, and the voyage already being dangerous, because the Fast was now already past, Paul warned them ,
052710 saying, Men, I perceive that this voyage is about to be with much harm and loss, and not only much cargo and of the ship, but also of our souls.
052711 But the centurion was rather persuaded by the helmsman and the shipmaster, than by the things spoken by Paul.
052712 And the port not being fit to winter in, the most of them advised to set sail from there, if by any means they might be able to get to Phoenix to winter; which is a port of Crete, looking toward the southwest and northwest.
052713 And a south wind blowing softly, thinking to have obtained their purpose, lifting anchor , they sailed along close beside Crete.
052714 But not long after, a stormy wind called Euroclydon beat down on it.
052715 And the ship being seized, and not being able to beat against the wind, giving way we were borne along.
052716 And running under an islet being called Clauda, we hardly were able to become masters of the boat;
052717 which taking, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they should fall into the sandbanks of Syrtis, lowering the tackle, so they were borne along.
052718 And being exceedingly storm-tossed with a tempest, they made a casting on the next day ;
052719 And on the third day we threw out the ship's tackle with our hands.
052720 And neither sun nor stars appearing in many days, and no small tempest pressing hard, now all hope that we would be saved was taken away.
052721 But there being much fasting, then standing up in their midst, Paul said, O men, being obedient to me you ought not to have set sail from Crete, and to have come by this harm and loss.
052722 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there will be no casting away of life among you, only of the ship.
052723 For tonight an angel of God stood beside me, whose I am and whom I serve,
052724 saying, Fear not, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And behold! God has given you all those who sail with you.
052725 Therefore, men, be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it will be so, according to the way it was told me.
052726 But we must fall on a certain island.
052727 But when the fourteenth night came, we being carried about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors thought that they drew near some country.
052728 And sounding they found it twenty fathoms; and moving a little further, and sounding again, they found it fifteen fathoms.
052729 And fearing that we would fall on rocks, and casting four anchors out of the stern, they wished day to come.
052730 But the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and lowering the boat into the sea, pretending to be about to cast out anchors from the prow,
052731 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.
052732 Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the boat, and let her fall.
052733 And until day was about to come, Paul begged all to take food, saying, This is the fourteenth day that you continued waiting without food, having taken nothing.
052734 Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your deliverance. For not a hair of your head shall perish.
052735 And saying these things, and taking bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and breaking, he began to eat.
052736 And all becoming cheered, they also took food.
052737 And we were, all the souls in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six.
052738 And being filled with food, they lightened the ship, throwing the wheat into the sea.
052739 And when day came, they did not recognize the land. But they discovered a certain bay with a beach, into which they were minded, if they were able, to drive the ship.
052740 And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea; at the same time they loosened the rudder bands and hoisted up the foresail to the wind and held to the shore.
052741 And coming on a place between two seas, they drove the vessel. And indeed the prow sticking fast, it remained unmovable. But the stern was broken with the violence of the waves.
052742 And the mind of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out and escape.
052743 But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, kept them from their purpose and commanded those who could swim, to throw themselves overboard, to go out on the land.
052744 And the rest went , some on boards and others on some of the things from the ship. And so it happened that all were saved on the land.
052801 And being saved, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
052802 And the foreigners showed us not the common kindness. For they kindled a fire and welcomed all of us, because of the rain coming on, and because of the cold.
052803 And Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a viper came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.
052804 And when the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, being saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed to live.
052805 Then indeed he shook off the creature into the fire, suffering no harm.
052806 But they expected him to be about to become inflamed, or to fall down dead suddenly, But over much time expecting and seeing nothing amiss happening to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
052807 In the quarters about that place were lands to the chief of the island, whose name was Publius. Welcoming us, he lodged us courteously three days.
052808 And it happened the father of Publius was lying down, suffering fevers and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and praying and laying on his hands, he healed him.
052809 Then this taking place, the rest who were having infirmities in the island also came, and were healed.
052810 They also honored us with many honors. And on our setting sail, they laid on the things of our needs.
052811 And after three months we sailed in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian with an ensign, The Twin Brothers.
052812 And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.
052813 Going around from there we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind coming on, we came to Puteoli on the second,
052814 where finding brothers, we were asked to stay seven days. And so we went toward Rome.
052815 And the brothers from there hearing of us, they came to meet us as far as the market-place of Appius, and Three Taverns. Seeing them, thanking God, Paul took courage.
052816 And when we came into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the camp commander. But Paul was allowed to dwell by himself, with a soldier guarding him.
052817 And after three days it happened that Paul called together those being chief of the Jews. And they coming together, he said to them, Men, brothers, I did nothing against the people or customs of our fathers. I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans
052818 who, examining me, were of a mind to let me go because there was no cause of death in me.
052819 But the Jews speaking against it , I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not as having anything to accuse my nation.
052820 For this cause, then, I called for you, to see and to speak with you . For I have this chain around me for the hope of Israel.
052821 And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who came declared or spoke anything evil of you.
052822 But we think it right to hear from you what you think. For truly as concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.
052823 And they having appointed him a day, many came to him in his lodging; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them the things concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets, from morning until evening.
052824 And some indeed believed the things that were said, others did not believe.
052825 And disagreeing with one another, they were let go, Paul saying one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,
052826 saying, "Go to this people and say: Hearing you shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see and not perceive.
052827 For the heart of this people was fattened, and they have heard with their ears dully; and they closed their eyes; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
052828 Therefore be it known to you that the salvation of God is sent to the nations, and they will hear.
052829 And he having said these words, the Jews departed, having much discussion amongst themselves.
052830 And Paul remained two years in his own hired house. And he welcomed all who came in to him,
052831 proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching those things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom, and without hindrance.
060101 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God
060102 (which He had promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures),
060103 about His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,
060104 who was marked out the Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead;
060105 by whom we have received grace and apostleship, to obedience to the faith among all nations, for His name;
060106 among whom you also are the called-out ones of Jesus Christ:
060107 to all those who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
060108 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
060109 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
060110 always in my prayers, making request if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.
060111 For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to you for the establishing of you.
060112 And this is to be comforted together with you by our mutual faith, both yours and mine.
060113 But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, and was kept back until the present; that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other nations.
060114 I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the foreigners, both to the wise and to the unwise.
060115 So, as much as is in me lies , I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are at Rome also.
060116 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
060117 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, "The just shall live by faith."
060118 For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,
060119 because the thing which may be known of God is clearly revealed within them, for God revealed it to them.
060120 For the unseen things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being realized by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, for them to be without excuse.
060121 Because, knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, neither were thankful. But they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
060122 Professing to be wise, they became fools
060123 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.
060124 Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.
060125 For they changed the truth of God into a lie, and they worshiped and served the created thing more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
060126 For this cause, God gave them up to dishonorable affections. For even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature.
060127 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another; males with males working out shamefulness, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was fitting for their error.
060128 And even as they did not think fit to have God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do the things not right,
060129 being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; being full of envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, evil habits, becoming whisperers,
060130 backbiters, haters of God, insolent, proud, braggarts, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
060131 undiscerning, perfidious, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;
060132 who, knowing the righteous order of God, that those practicing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but have pleasure in those practicing them .
060201 Therefore you are without excuse, O man, everyone who judges; for in that in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, for you who judge do the same things.
060202 But know that the judgment of God is according to truth on those who practice such things.
060203 And, O man, the one judging those who do such things, and practice them, do you think this, that you shall escape the judgment of God?
060204 Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, and the forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?
060205 But according to your hardness and your impenitent heart, do you treasure up wrath for yourself in a day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
060206 who will render to each according to his works;
060207 indeed to those who with patience in good work are seeking for glory, and honor, and incorruptibility, everlasting life.
060208 But to those who indeed disobeying the truth out of self-seeking, and obeying unrighteousness, will be anger and wrath,
060209 tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who has worked out evil; of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.
060210 But He will give glory, honor and peace to every man who works good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
060211 For there is no respect of faces with God.
060212 For as many as sinned without Law will also perish without Law. And as many as have sinned within Law shall be judged through Law.
060213 For it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.
060214 For when the nations, who do not have the Law, do by nature the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law unto themselves;
060215 who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and the thoughts between one another accusing or even excusing one another,
060216 in a day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
060217 Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the Law, and boast in God;
060218 and know His will and approve the things excelling, being instructed out of the Law;
060219 and persuading yourselves to be a guide of the blind, a light to those in darkness;
060220 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Law.
060221 Therefore the one teaching another, do you not teach yourself? The one preaching not to steal, do you steal?
060222 The one saying not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The one detesting idols, do you rob temples?
060223 You who boast in Law, do you dishonor God through breaking the Law?
060224 For the name of God is blasphemed among the nations because of you, as it is written.
060225 For circumcision truly profits if you keep the Law, but if you are a transgressor of the Law, circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
060226 If then the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
060227 And the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the Law, shall it not judge you, who through letter and circumcision become transgressors of the Law?
060228 For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that outwardly in flesh;
060229 but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart; in spirit and not in letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.
060301 Then what is the superiority of the Jew? Or what is the profit of circumcision?
060302 Much, by every way! Chiefly, indeed, because they were entrusted with the oracles of God.
060303 For what? If some did not believe, will not their unbelief nullify the faith of God?
060304 Let it not be! But let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, "That You might be justified in Your sayings, and will overcome when You are judged."
060305 But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who lays on wrath? (I speak as a man.)
060306 Let it not be! For then how shall God judge the world?
060307 For if in my lie the truth has more abounded to His glory why am I still judged as a sinner?
060308 And not rather , (as we are wrongly accused, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do bad things that good may come? Their condemnation is just.
060309 What then? Do we excel? No, in no way; for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks all with being under sin,
060310 as it is written: "There is none righteous, no not one;
060311 there is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God."
060312 "They are all gone out of the way, they have together become unprofitable, there is none that does good, no, not one."
060313 "Their throat is an open grave, with their tongues they have used deceit, the poison of asps is under their lips;
060314 whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;"
060315 "their feet are swift to shed blood;
060316 destruction and misery are in their way,
060317 and the way of peace they did not know."
060318 "There is no fear of God before their eyes."
060319 But we know that whatever things the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law; so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be under judgment before God,
060320 because by the works of the Law none of all flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law is the knowledge of sin.
060321 But now a righteousness of God has been revealed apart from Law, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets;
060322 even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ, toward all and upon all those who believe. For there is no difference,
060323 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,
060324 being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;
060325 whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness through the passing by of the sins that had taken place before, in the forbearance of God;
060326 for the display of His righteousness at this time, for Him to be just and, forgiving the one being of the faith of Jesus.
060327 Then where is the boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.
060328 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law.
060329 Or is He the God of the Jews only, and not also of the nations? Yes, of the nations also,
060330 since it is one God who will justify circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
060331 Do we then make the Law void through faith? Let it not be! But we establish the Law.
060401 What then shall we say that our father Abraham has found, according to flesh?
060402 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has a boast; but not before God.
060403 For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."
060404 But to him working, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.
060405 But to him not working, but believing on Him justifying the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
060406 Even as David also says of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness without works,
060407 saying , "Blessed are those whose lawlessnesses are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;
060408 blessed is the man to whom the Lord will in no way impute sin."
060409 Is this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
060410 How then was it reckoned? Being in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
060411 And he received a sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith while still uncircumcised; so that he might be the father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for righteousness to be imputed to them also;
060412 and a father of circumcision to those not of the circumcision only, but also to those walking by the steps of the faith of our father Abraham during uncircumcision.
060413 For the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.
060414 For if they of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is made of no effect;
060415 because the Law works out wrath, for where no law is, there is no transgression.
060416 Therefore it is of faith so that it might be according to grace; for the promise to be made sure to all the seed, not only to that which is of the Law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all
060417 (as it has been written, "I have made you a father of many nations") --before God, whom he believed, who makes the dead live, and calls the things which do not exist as though they do exist.
060418 For he who beyond hope believed on hope for him to become the father of many nations (according to that which was spoken, "So your seed shall be").
060419 And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body already dead (being about a hundred years old) or the deadening of Sarah's womb.
060420 He did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,
060421 and being fully persuaded that what God had promised, He was also able to perform.
060422 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
060423 Now it was not written for him alone that it was imputed to him,
060424 but for us also to whom it is to be imputed, to the ones believing on Him who has raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
060425 who was delivered because of our offenses and was raised for our justification.
060501 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
060502 Through Him we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice on the hope of the glory of God.
060503 And not only this , but we glory in afflictions also, knowing that afflictions work out patience,
060504 and patience works out experience, and experience works out hope.
060505 And hope does not make us ashamed, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit given to us.
060506 For we yet being without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
060507 For one will with difficulty die for a righteous one, yet perhaps one would even dare to die for a good one.
060508 But God commends His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.
060509 Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.
060510 For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
060511 And not only so , but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.
060512 Therefore, even as through one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed on all men inasmuch as all sinned:
060513 for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
060514 But death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is the type of Him who was to come;
060515 but the free gift shall not be also like the offense. For if by the offense of the one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace; which is of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.
060516 And the free gift shall not be as by one having sinned; (for indeed the judgment was of one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.
060517 For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.)
060518 Therefore as by one offense sentence came on all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of One the free gift came to all men to justification of life.
060519 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.
060520 But the Law entered so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,
060521 so that as sin has reigned to death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
060601 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound?
060602 Let it not be! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?
060603 Do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?
060604 Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father; even so we also should walk in newness of life.
060605 For if we have been joined together in the likeness of His death, we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection;
060606 knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.
060607 For he who died has been justified from sin.
060608 But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,
060609 knowing that when Christ was raised from the dead, He dies no more; death no longer has dominion over Him.
060610 For in that He died, He died to sin once; but in that He lives, He lives to God.
060611 Likewise count yourselves also to be truly dead to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
060612 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.
060613 Do not yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God, as one alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
060614 For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under Law, but under grace.
060615 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Law, but under grace? Let it not be!
060616 Do you not know that to whom you yield yourselves as slaves for obedience, you are slaves to him whom you obey; whether it is of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness.
060617 But thanks be to our God that you were the slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered.
060618 Then being made free from sin, you became the slaves of righteousness.
060619 I speak in the manner of men because of the weakness of your flesh; for as you have yielded your members as slaves to uncleanness, and to lawless act unto lawless act, even so now yield your members as slaves to righteousness unto holiness.
060620 For when you were the slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.
060621 What fruit did you have then in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
060622 But now, being made free from sin, and having become slaves to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.
060623 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
060701 Or are you ignorant, brothers; for I speak to those who know the Law; that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?
060702 For the married woman was bound by law to the living husband. But if the husband is dead, she is set free from the law of her husband.
060703 So then if , while her husband lives, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress by becoming another man's wife.
060704 So, my brothers, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ so that you should be married to Another, even to Him raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.
060705 For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin worked in our members through the law to bring forth fruit to death.
060706 But now we having been set free from the Law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of the letter.
060707 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Let it not be said! But I did not know sin except through the law. For also I did not know lust except the law said, You shall not lust.
060708 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all kinds of lust. For apart from law sin was dead.
060709 For I was alive without the law once. But when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.
060710 And the commandment, which was to life, was found to be death to me.
060711 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me .
060712 So indeed the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.
060713 Then has that which is good become death to me? Let it not be! But sin, that it might appear to be sin, working death in me by that which is good; in order that sin might become exceedingly sinful by the commandment.
060714 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.
060715 For that which I do, I know not. For what I desire, that I do not do; but what I hate, that I do.
060716 If then I do that which I do not desire, I consent to the law that it is good.
060717 But now it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
060718 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing. For to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I do not find.
060719 For I do not do the good that I desire; but the evil which I do not will, that I do.
060720 But if I do what I do not desire, it is no more I working it out, but sin dwelling in me.
060721 I find then a law: when I will to do the right, evil is present with me.
060722 For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man;
060723 but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin being in my members.
060724 O wretched man that I am ! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
060725 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
060801 There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
060802 But the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.
060803 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh;
060804 so that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
060805 For they who are according to the flesh mind the things of flesh, but they who are according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
060806 For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace
060807 because the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be .
060808 So then they who are in the flesh cannot please God.
060809 But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.
060810 And if Christ is in you, indeed the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
060811 But if the Spirit of the One who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the One who raised up Christ from the dead shall also make your mortal bodies alive by His Spirit who dwells in you.
060812 Therefore, brothers, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
060813 For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die. But if you through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.
060814 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
060815 For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption by which we cry, Abba, Father!
060816 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
060817 And if we are children, then we are heirs; heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; so that if we suffer with Him , we may also be glorified together.
060818 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed in us.
060819 For the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.
060820 For the creation was not willingly subjected to vanity, but because of Him who subjected it on hope
060821 that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
060822 And we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.
060823 And not only so , but ourselves also, who have the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, awaiting adoption, the redemption of our body.
060824 For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope; for what anyone sees, why does he also hope for it ?
060825 But if we hope for that which we do not see, then we wait for it with patience.
060826 Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
060827 And He searching the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
060828 And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
060829 For whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, for Him to be the First-born among many brothers.
060830 But whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, those He also justified. And whom He justified, these He also glorified.
060831 What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
060832 Truly He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?
060833 Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God who justifies.
060834 Who is he condemning? It is Christ who has died, but rather also who is raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
060835 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
060836 As it is written, "For Your sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep of slaughter."
060837 But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.
060838 For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
060839 nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
060901 I tell the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,
060902 that I have great heaviness and continual pain in my heart.
060903 For I myself was wishing to be accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh,
060904 who are Israelites; to whom belong the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the service of God , and the promises;
060905 whose are the fathers, and of whom is the Christ according to flesh, He being God over all, blessed forever. Amen.
060906 Not however that the word of God has failed, for not all those of Israel are Israel;
060907 nor because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children. But, "In Isaac shall your Seed be called."
060908 That is, not the children of the flesh are children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for a seed.
060909 For this is the word of promise: "At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son."
060910 And not only this , but when Rebekah also had conceived by one, by our father Isaac
060911 (for the children had not yet been born, neither had done any good or evil; but that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but of Him who called,)
060912 it was said to her, "The elder shall serve the younger."
060913 As it is written, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
060914 What shall we say then? Is there not unrighteousness with God? Let it not be!
060915 For He said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
060916 So then it is not of the one willing, nor of the one running, but of God, the One showing mercy.
060917 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "Even for this same purpose I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you, and that My name might be declared throughout all the earth."
060918 Therefore He has mercy on whom He will have mercy , and whom He will, He hardens.
060919 You will then say to me, Why does He yet find fault? For who has resisted His will?
060920 No, but, O man, who are you who replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him who formed it , Why have you made me this way?
060921 Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?
060922 What if God, willing to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction;
060923 and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy which He had before prepared to glory;
060924 whom He also called, not only us, of Jews, but also of the nations?
060925 As He also says in Hosea, "I will call those not My people, My people; and those not beloved, Beloved."
060926 And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them. "You are not My people; there they shall be called sons of the living God."
060927 Isaiah also cries concerning Israel, "Though the number of the sons of Israel is as the sands of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.
060928 For He is bringing the matter to an end, and cutting short in righteousness, because the Lord will make a short work on the earth."
060929 And as Isaiah said before, "Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have been as Sodom, and would have been like Gomorrah."
060930 What shall we say then? That the nations, who did not follow after righteousness have taken on righteousness, but a righteousness of faith.
060931 But Israel, who followed after a law of righteousness did not arrive at a law of righteousness.
060932 Why? Because it was not of faith, but as it were by the works of the Law. For they stumbled at that Stumbling-stone;
060933 as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a Stumbling-stone and a Rock-of-offense, and everyone believing on Him shall not be put to shame."
061001 Brothers, truly my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is for it to be saved.
061002 For I bear record to them that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
061003 For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.
061004 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness for everyone who believes.
061005 For Moses writes of the righteousness which is of the Law, "The man who does those things shall live by them."
061006 But the righteousness of faith says this: "Do not say in your heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven?" that is, to bring Christ down;
061007 or "Who shall descend into the deep?"; that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.
061008 But what does it say? "The word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart"; that is, the word of faith which we proclaim;
061009 Because if you confess the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.
061010 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses unto salvation.
061011 For the Scripture says, "Everyone believing on Him shall not be put to shame."
061012 For there is no difference both of Jew and of Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call on Him.
061013 For everyone, "whoever shall call on the name of the Lord will be saved."
061014 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without preaching?
061015 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things!"
061016 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"
061017 Then faith is of hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
061018 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes indeed, their voice went out into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
061019 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, "I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you."
061020 But Isaiah is very bold and says, "I was found by those who did not seek Me, I became known to those who did not ask after Me."
061021 But to Israel He says, "All day long I have stretched forth My hands to a disobeying and gainsaying people."
061101 I say then, Did not God put away His people? Let it not be said ! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
061102 God did not thrust out His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture said in Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel, saying,
061103 "Lord, they killed Your prophets and dug down Your altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
061104 But what does the Divine answer say to him? "I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
061105 Even so then, also in this present time a remnant according to the election of grace has come into being.
061106 But if by grace, then it is no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it is of works, then it is no more of grace; otherwise work is no more work.
061107 What then? Israel has not obtained that which it seeks, but the election obtained it , and the rest were hardened
061108 even as it is written, "God gave to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not seeing, and ears not hearing" until this day.
061109 And David said, "Let their table become for a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense to them.
061110 Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see, and their back always bowing."
061111 I say then, Did they not stumble that they fall? Let it not be! But by their slipping away came salvation to the nations, to provoke them to jealousy.
061112 But if their slipping away is the riches of the world, and their default is the riches of the nations, how much more their fullness?
061113 For I speak to you, the nations; since I am the apostle of the nations, I glorify my ministry;
061114 if by any means I may provoke those who are my flesh to jealousy, and might save some of them.
061115 For if their casting away is the reconciling of the world, what is the reception except life from the dead?
061116 For if the firstfruit is holy, the lump is also holy ; and if the root is holy, also the branches.
061117 And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and became a sharer of the root and the fatness of the olive tree with them,
061118 do not boast against the branches. But if you boast, it is not you that bears the root, but the root bears you.
061119 You will say then, The branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.
061120 Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be high-minded, but fear.
061121 For if God did not spare the natural branches, fear lest He also may not spare you either!
061122 Behold then the kindness, and the severity of God; on those having fallen, severity; but on you, kindness, if you continue in the kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.
061123 And those also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.
061124 For if you were cut out of the natural wild olive tree , and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree ; how much more these being according to nature will be grafted into their own olive-tree?
061125 For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, lest you should be wise within yourselves; that blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the nations has comes in.
061126 And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written, "There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
061127 For this is My covenant with them, when I have taken away their sins."
061128 Indeed as regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes. But as regards the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.
061129 For the free gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
061130 For as you also then disbelieved God, but now have been shown mercy through their disbelief,
061131 even so these also have not believed now, so that through your mercy they may also obtain mercy.
061132 For God has shut up all in unbelief, so that He might show mercy to all.
061133 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!
061134 For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who became His counselor?
061135 Or who first gave to Him, and it will be repaid to him?
061136 For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things; to Him be glory forever! Amen.
061201 I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.
061202 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, in order to prove by you what is that good and pleasing and perfect will of God.
061203 For I say, through the grace given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think. But set your mind to be right-minded, even as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.
061204 For even as we have many members in one body, and all members do not have the same function,
061205 so we the many are one body in Christ, and each one members of one another.
061206 Then having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, if prophecy, according to the proportion of faith;
061207 or ministry, in the ministry; or he who teaches, in the teaching;
061208 or he who exhorts, in the encouragement; or he who shares, in simplicity; or he who takes the lead, in diligence; or he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.
061209 Let love be without hypocrisy, shrinking from evil, cleaving to good;
061210 in brotherly love to one another, loving fervently, having led one another in honor.
061211 As to diligence, not slothful, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;
061212 rejoicing in hope, patient in affliction, steadfastly continuing in prayer,
061213 distributing to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality.
061214 Bless those who persecute you; bless, and do not curse.
061215 Rejoice with rejoicing ones, and weep with weeping ones;
061216 minding the same thing toward one another, not minding high things, but yielding to the lowly. Do not be wise within yourselves.
061217 Repay no one evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
061218 If it is possible, as far as is in you, being in peace with all men.
061219 not avenging yourselves, beloved, but giving place to wrath; for it is written, "Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord."
061220 Therefore if your enemy hungers, feed him. If he thirsts, give him drink. For in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head.
061221 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
061301 Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority but of God; the authorities that exist are ordained by God.
061302 So that the one resisting the authority resists the ordinance of God; and the ones who resist will receive judgment to themselves.
061303 For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire to be not afraid of the authority? Do the good, and you shall have praise from it.
061304 For it is a servant of God to you for good. For if you practice evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in vain; for it is a servant of God, a revenger for wrath on him who does evil.
061305 Therefore you must be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.
061306 For because of this you also pay taxes. For they are God's servants, always giving attention to this very thing.
061307 Therefore give to all their dues; to the one due tax, the tax; tribute to whom tribute is due , fear to whom fear is due , and honor to whom honor is due .
061308 Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves another has fulfilled the law.
061309 For: "Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; do not lust;" and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
061310 Love works no ill to its neighbor, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
061311 This also, knowing the time, that it is already time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.
061312 The night is far spent, the day is at hand; therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
061313 Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in carousings and drinking; not in co-habitation and lustful acts; not in strife and envy.
061314 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take thought beforehand for the lusts of the flesh.
061401 And receive him who is weak in the faith, but not to judgments of your thoughts.
061402 For indeed one believes to eat all things; but being weak, another eats vegetables.
061403 Do not let him who eats despise him who does not eat; and do not let him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.
061404 Who are you that judges another's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. But he will stand, for God is able to make him stand.
061405 One indeed esteems a day above another day; and another esteems every day alike . Let each one be fully assured in his own mind.
061406 He who regards the day regards it to the Lord; and he not regarding the day, does not regard it to the Lord. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, does not eat to the Lord, and gives God thanks.
061407 For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.
061408 For both if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore both if we live, and if we die, we are the Lord's.
061409 For this Christ both died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and living.
061410 But why do you judge your brother? Or also why do you despise your brother? For all shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
061411 For it is written, " As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
061412 So then each one of us will give account concerning himself to God.
061413 Then let us not judge one another any more, but rather judge this, not to put a stumbling-block or an offense toward his brother.
061414 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing by itself is common; except to him who esteems anything to be common, it is common.
061415 But if your brother is grieved with your food, you no longer walk according to love. Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died.
061416 Then do not let your good be spoken evil of,
061417 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
061418 For he who serves Christ in these things is well-pleasing to God, and approved by men.
061419 So then let us pursue the things of peace, and the things for building up one another.
061420 Do not undo the work of God for food. Truly, all things indeed are clean, but it is bad to the man eating because of a stumbling-block.
061421 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.
061422 Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
061423 But, the one doubting, if he eats, he has been condemned, because it is not of faith; and all that is not of faith is sin.
061501 Then we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
061502 Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good, to building up.
061503 For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me."
061504 For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, so that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.
061505 And may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded toward one another according to Christ Jesus,
061506 so that with one mind and one mouth you may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
061507 Therefore receive one another as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.
061508 And I say, Jesus Christ has become a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers,
061509 and that the nations might glorify God for His mercy, as it is written, "For this cause I will confess to You in the nations, and I will praise Your name."
061510 And again He says, "Rejoice, O nations, with His people."
061511 And again, "Praise the Lord, all the nations, and praise Him, all the peoples."
061512 And again Isaiah says, "There shall be a root of Jesse, and He who shall rise to reign over the nations, in Him shall the nations trust."
061513 And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.
061514 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
061515 But, brothers, I wrote to you boldly, as reminding you in part, because of the grace that is given to me by God,
061516 that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the nations, ministering the gospel of God, so that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
061517 Therefore I have boasting in Christ Jesus as to the things pertaining to God.
061518 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ did not work out by me for the obedience of the nations in word and deed,
061519 in power of miracles and wonders, in power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem, and all around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
061520 Yea, so I have been eager to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation;
061521 but as it is written, "To whom nothing was said about Him, they shall see. And they who have not heard shall understand."
061522 For this cause I also have been greatly hindered from coming to you.
061523 But now, having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,
061524 whenever I may go into Spain, I will come to you. For in traveling through I hope to see you, and to be set forward there by you, if first I may be filled of you in part.
061525 But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.
061526 For it has pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints in Jerusalem.
061527 Truly it has pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the nations have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in fleshly things.
061528 Therefore when I have completed this, and have sealed this fruit to them, I will come by you into Spain.
061529 And I am sure that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
061530 But I exhort you, brothers, for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,
061531 that I may be delivered from those disbelieving in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted by the saints;
061532 so that I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.
061533 Now may the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
061601 I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea,
061602 that you receive her in the Lord, as becomes saints, and that you may assist her in whatever business she has need of you. For she has been a helper of many, and of myself also.
061603 Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus,
061604 who have laid down their own necks for my life; to whom not only I give thanks, but also the churches of the nations.
061605 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Greet my beloved Epenetus, who is the first-fruits of Achaia to Christ.
061606 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on us.
061607 Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
061608 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
061609 Greet Urbanus, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
061610 Greet Apelles, approved in Christ. Greet those who are of Aristobulus' household .
061611 Greet Herodion my kinsman. Greet those who are of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
061612 Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord.
061613 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
061614 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers with them.
061615 Greet Philologus and Julias, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them.
061616 Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you.
061617 And I exhort you, brothers, to watch those making divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them.
061618 For they who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches they deceive the hearts of the simple.
061619 For your obedience reached to all. Therefore I am glad on your behalf, But I would have you truly wise as to good, and simple toward evil.
061620 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
061621 Timothy my fellow worker, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen, greet you.
061622 I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, greet you in the Lord.
061623 Gaius my host, and the host of me and the whole church, greets you. Erastus the steward of the city greets you, and Quartus a brother.
061624 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
061625 Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery, having been unvoiced during eternal times;
061626 but now has been made plain, and by the prophetic Scriptures, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith;
061627 to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
070101 Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
070102 to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called out with all those in every place who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.
070103 Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
070104 I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God given you in Jesus Christ,
070105 that in everything you are enriched by Him, in all speech and in all knowledge;
070106 even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you;
070107 so that you come behind in no gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
070108 He shall also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
070109 God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
070110 But I exhort you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
070111 For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
070112 But I say this, that every one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
070113 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
070114 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
070115 lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.
070116 And I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides these, I do not know if I baptized any other.
070117 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel; not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.
070118 For the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those being lost, but to us being saved, it is the power of God.
070119 For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the understanding of the perceiving ones."
070120 Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
070121 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom did not know God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.
070122 For the Jews ask for a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom;
070123 but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness.
070124 But to them, the called-out ones, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
070125 Because the foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.
070126 For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise men according to the flesh are called , not many mighty, not many noble.
070127 But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
070128 and God has chosen the base things of the world, and things which are despised, and things which are not, in order to bring to nothing things that are;
070129 so that no flesh should glory in His presence.
070130 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;
070131 so that, according as it is written, "He who glories, let him glory in the Lord."
070201 And I, brothers, when I came to you, did not come with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.
070202 For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
070203 And I was with you in weakness and in fear, and in much trembling.
070204 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
070205 so that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
070206 But, we speak wisdom among those who are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, that come to nothing.
070207 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, which God has hidden, predetermining it before the world for our glory;
070208 which none of the rulers of this world knew (for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory).
070209 But as it is written, "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard," nor has it entered into the heart of man, "the things which God has prepared for those who love Him."
070210 But God has revealed them to us by His Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God.
070211 For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of man within him? So also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.
070212 But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.
070213 These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
070214 But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned.
070215 But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged by no one.
070216 For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
070301 And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual ones, but as to fleshly, as to babes in Christ.
070302 I have fed you with milk and not with solid food, for you were not yet able to bear it ; nor are you able even now.
070303 For you are yet carnal. For in that there is among you envyings and strife and divisions, are you not carnal, and do you not walk according to men?
070304 For while one says, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you not carnal?
070305 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each?
070306 I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.
070307 So then neither is he who plants anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.
070308 So he planting, and he watering, are one, and each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
070309 For of God we are fellow-workers, a field of God, and you are a building of God.
070310 According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it . But let every man be careful how he builds on it .
070311 For any other foundation can no one lay than the one being laid, who is Jesus Christ.
070312 And if anyone builds on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,
070313 each one's work shall be revealed. For the Day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try each one's work as to what kind it is.
070314 If anyone's work which he built remains, he shall receive a reward.
070315 If anyone's work shall be burned up, he shall suffer loss. But he shall be saved, yet so as by fire.
070316 Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
070317 If anyone defiles the temple of God, God shall destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.
070318 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he may be wise.
070319 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, "He takes the wise in their own craftiness."
070320 And again, " The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
070321 Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours,
070322 whether it is Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours,
070323 and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
070401 So let a man think of us as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
070402 And the rest, it is sought among stewards that one be found faithful.
070403 But to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by a man's day; but I do not judge my own self,
070404 for I know nothing by myself. Yet I have not been justified by this, but He who judges me is the Lord.
070405 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall each one have praise of God.
070406 And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, so that no one of you may be puffed up against one another.
070407 For who makes you to differ from another ? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it?
070408 Already you are full! Already you are rich! You have reigned as kings without us! And oh that indeed you did reign, that we also might reign with you.
070409 For I think that God has set forth us last, the apostles, as it were appointed to death; for we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.
070410 We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honorable, but we are despised.
070411 Even until this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place.
070412 And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
070413 being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.
070414 I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you .
070415 For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for I have begotten you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
070416 Therefore I beseech you, be imitators of me.
070417 For this cause I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.
070418 As to my not coming to you now, some are puffed up.
070419 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills. And I will not know the speech of those who are puffed up, but the power.
070420 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
070421 What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and the spirit of meekness?
070501 On the whole it is reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even named among the nations, so as one to have his father's wife.
070502 And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, so that he who has done this deed may be taken from your midst.
070503 For as being absent in body but present in spirit, I indeed have judged already as though I were present concerning him who worked out this thing;
070504 in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, with my spirit; also, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ;
070505 to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
070506 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
070507 Therefore purge out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For also Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.
070508 Therefore let us keep the feast; not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
070509 I wrote to you in the letter not to associate intimately with fornicators;
070510 yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you must go out of the world.
070511 But now I have written to you not to associate intimately, if any man called a brother and is either a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one not to eat.
070512 For what is it to me to also judge those who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?
070513 But God judges those who are outside. Therefore put out from you the evil one.
070601 Do any of you dare, when you have a matter against another, to go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
070602 Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
070603 Do you not know that we shall judge angels, not to mention the things of this life?
070604 If, then, you truly have judgments of the things of this life, set those who are least esteemed in the church to judge .
070605 For I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not a wise one among you, not even one in your midst who shall be able to judge between his brother?
070606 But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
070607 Indeed then there is already on the whole a failure among you, that you have lawsuits with yourselves. Why not instead be wronged? Why not instead be defrauded?
070608 But you do wrong and defraud, and these things to brothers.
070609 Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor abusers, nor homosexuals,
070610 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
070611 And such were some of you. But you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
070612 All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
070613 Meats for the belly and the belly for meats, but God shall destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body.
070614 And God has both raised up the Lord, and also will raise us up by His own power.
070615 Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? Let it not be!
070616 Or do you not know that he being joined to a harlot is one body? For He says, The two shall be one flesh.
070617 But he being joined to the Lord is one spirit.
070618 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.
070619 Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit in you, whom you have of God? And you are not your own,
070620 for you are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
070701 Now concerning what you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
070702 But, because of the fornications, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.
070703 Let the husband give to the wife proper kindness, and likewise the wife also to the husband.
070704 The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband. And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife.
070705 Do not deprive one another, unless it is with consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. And come together again so that Satan does not tempt you for your incontinence.
070706 But I speak this according to permission, not according to commandment.
070707 For I would that all men were even as I myself am. But each has his proper gift from God, one according to this manner and another according to that.
070708 I say therefore to the unmarried and the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I.
070709 But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.
070710 And to the married I command (not I, but the Lord), a woman not to be separated from her husband.
070711 But if she is indeed separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to leave his wife.
070712 But to the rest I speak, not the Lord, If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is pleased to dwell with him, do not let him put her away.
070713 And the woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is pleased to dwell with her, do not let her leave him.
070714 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; else your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
070715 But if the unbelieving one separates, let him be separated. A brother or a sister is not in bondage in such cases , but God has called us in peace.
070716 For what do you know, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? Or what do you know, O man, whether you shall save your wife?
070717 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all churches.
070718 Was any called having been circumcised? Do not be uncircumcised. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? Do not be circumcised.
070719 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
070720 Let each one remain in the calling in which he was called.
070721 Were you called as a slave? It does not matter to you, but if you are able to become free, use it rather.
070722 For he who is called a slave in the Lord is a freed man of the Lord. And likewise, he who is called a free man is a slave of Christ.
070723 You are bought with a price, do not be the slaves of men.
070724 Each in whatever way he was called, brothers, in this remain with God.
070725 But concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord. Yet I give my judgment, as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful.
070726 Then I think this is good, because of the present necessity; that it is good for a man to be so.
070727 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
070728 But if you do marry, you did not sin; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such shall have trouble in the flesh, but I spare you.
070729 But this I say, brothers, The time is short. It remains that both those who have wives should be as not having one.
070730 And they who weep are as though they did not weep. And they who rejoice are as though they did not rejoice. And they who buy are as though they did not possess.
070731 And they who use this world are as not abusing it , for the fashion of this world is passing away.
070732 But I desire you to be without anxiety. The one who is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how to please the Lord.
070733 But the one who is married cares for the things of the world, how to please his wife.
070734 The wife and the virgin are different. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
070735 And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is right, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction.
070736 But if anyone thinks it behaving himself indecently toward his virgin (if she is past her prime, and so it ought to be) let him do what he will; he does not sin; let them marry.
070737 But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but who has authority over his own will (and has so judged in his heart that he will keep his virginity) he does well.
070738 So then he who gives in marriage does well. But he who does not give in marriage does better.
070739 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives, but if her husband sleeps in death, she is at liberty to be remarried to whom she will, only in the Lord.
070740 But she is happier if she so remains, according to my judgment. And I also think that I have the Spirit of God.
070801 But concerning the sacrifices to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.
070802 And if any man thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.
070803 But if any one loves God, he has been known of him.
070804 Then concerning the eating of the things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.
070805 For though there are those who are called gods, whether in Heaven or in earth (as there are many gods and many lords),
070806 but there is to us only one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we by Him.
070807 But this knowledge is not in all. But some being aware of the idol eat as an idolatrous sacrifice until now, and their conscience being weak is defiled.
070808 But food does not commend us to God. For neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.
070809 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours becomes a stumbling block to those who are weak.
070810 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol temple, will not the weak one's conscience be lifted up so as to eat things sacrificed to idols?
070811 And on your knowledge the weak brother will fall, he for whom Christ died.
070812 And sinning in this way against your brothers, and wounding their conscience, being weak, you sin against Christ.
070813 Therefore, if food offends my brother, I will eat no flesh forever, that I do not offend my brother.
070901 Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
070902 If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
070903 My answer to those who examine me is this:
070904 Do we not have authority to eat and to drink?
070905 Do we not have authority to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord do, and Cephas?
070906 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no authority whether not to work?
070907 Who serves as a soldier at his own wages at any time? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock?
070908 Do I say these things according to man? Or does not the Law say the same also?
070909 For it is written in the law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox threshing grain." Does God take care for oxen?
070910 Or does He say it altogether for our sakes? It was written for us, so that he who plows should plow in hope, and so that he who threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope.
070911 If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
070912 If others have a share of this authority over you, rather should not we? But we have not used this authority, but we endured all things lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
070913 Do you not know that those who minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? And those attending the altar are partakers with the altar.
070914 Even so, the Lord ordained those announcing the gospel to live from the gospel.
070915 But I have used none of these things, nor have I written these things that it should be done so to me; for it is good for me rather to die than that anyone nullify my glorying.
070916 For though I preach the gospel, no glory is to me. For necessity is laid on me; yea, woe is to me if I do not preach the gospel!
070917 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.
070918 What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel.
070919 For though I am free from all, yet I have made myself servant to all, so that I might gain the more.
070920 And to the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might gain the Jews. To those who are under the Law, I became as under the Law, so that I might gain those who are under the Law.
070921 To those who are outside Law, I became as outside Law (not being outside law to God, but under the law to Christ), so that I might gain those who are outside Law.
070922 To the weak I became as the weak, so that I might gain the weak. I am made all things to all men , so that I might by all means save some.
070923 And this I do for the sake of the gospel, so that I might be partaker of it with you .
070924 Do you not know that those running in a race all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.
070925 And everyone who strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Then those truly that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.
070926 So then I run, not as if I were uncertain. And so I fight, not as one who beats the air.
070927 But I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest proclaiming to others I myself might be rejected.
071001 And, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.
071002 And all were baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
071003 and all ate the same spiritual food,
071004 and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.
071005 But with many of them God was not well pleased, for they were scattered in the wilderness.
071006 And these things were our examples, that we should not be lusters after evil, as they also lusted.
071007 Nor should we be idolaters, even as some of them, as it is written: "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
071008 Nor let us commit fornication, as some of them fornicated, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.
071009 Nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted Him and were destroyed by serpents.
071010 Nor murmur as some of them also murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer.
071011 And all these things happened to them as examples; and it is written for our warning on whom the ends of the world have come.
071012 So let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
071013 No temptation has taken you but what is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but with the temptation also will make a way to escape, so that you may be able to bear it .
071014 Therefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
071015 I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say.
071016 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
071017 For we, the many, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread.
071018 Behold Israel after the flesh. Are not those who eat of the sacrifices also partakers of the altar?
071019 What then do I say? That the idol is anything, or that an idolatrous sacrifice is anything?
071020 But I say that the things which the nations sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. And I do not desire that you should have fellowship with demons.
071021 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of a table of demons.
071022 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
071023 All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful to me, but not all things build up.
071024 Let no one seek his own, but each one another's.
071025 Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no question for conscience' sake;
071026 "for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it."
071027 If any of those who do not believe invite you to a feast , and if you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for conscience' sake.
071028 But if anyone says to you, This is slain in sacrifice to idols, do not eat for the sake of him who showed it , and for conscience' sake; "for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it";
071029 conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's. For why is my liberty judged by another's conscience?
071030 For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
071031 Therefore whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
071032 Give no offense, either to the Jews, or to the Greeks or to the church of God;
071033 even as I please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, so that they may be saved.
071101 Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
071102 But I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and you keep the doctrines as I delivered them to you.
071103 But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
071104 Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered dishonors his Head.
071105 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head; for that is even the same as if she were shaved.
071106 For if the woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn. But if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.
071107 For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.
071108 For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.
071109 Nor was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.
071110 For this reason the woman ought to have authority on her head because of the angels.
071111 But neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.
071112 For as the woman is of the man, even so the man is also through the woman; but all things of God.
071113 Judge among yourselves: is it right that a woman pray to God unveiled?
071114 Does not even nature itself teach you that if man has long hair, it is a shame to him?
071115 But if a woman should have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her in place of a veil.
071116 But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the churches of God.
071117 But in enjoining this, I do not praise you , because you come together not for the better, but for the worse.
071118 For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.
071119 For there must also be heresies among you, that the approved ones may be revealed among you.
071120 Therefore when you come together into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
071121 For in eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry, and another drunken.
071122 For do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God, and shame those who do not have? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? I do not praise you !
071123 For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;
071124 And giving thanks, He broke it and said, "Take, eat; this is My body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of Me."
071125 In the same way He took the cup also, after supping, saying, "This cup is the New Covenant in My blood; as often as you drink it, do this in remembrance of Me."
071126 For "as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show" the Lord's death until He shall come.
071127 So that whoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, he will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
071128 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.
071129 For he who eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
071130 For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and many sleep.
071131 For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged.
071132 But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
071133 So that, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
071134 But if anyone hungers, let him eat at home, so that you do not come together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.
071201 Now concerning spiritual gifts , brothers, I would not have you ignorant.
071202 You know that being led away, you nations were led to dumb idols.
071203 Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says Jesus is a curse, and that no one can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.
071204 But there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit.
071205 And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord.
071206 And there are differences of workings, but it is the same God working all things in all.
071207 But to each one is given the showing forth of the Spirit to our profit.
071208 For through the Spirit is given to one a word of wisdom; and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;
071209 and to another faith by the same Spirit; and to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
071210 and to another workings of powers, to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues.
071211 But the one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing separately to each one as He desires.
071212 For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.
071213 For also by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, even all were made to drink into one Spirit.
071214 For the body is not one member, but many.
071215 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
071216 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
071217 If all the body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If all hearing, where would be the smelling?
071218 But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body as it has pleased Him.
071219 And if they were all one member, where would be the body?
071220 But now indeed many are the members, yet only one body.
071221 And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
071222 But much rather the members of the body seeming to be weaker are necessary.
071223 And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we put more abundant honor around them . And our unpresentable members have more abundant propriety.
071224 For our presentable members have no need, but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member having need;
071225 that there not be division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.
071226 And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it ; if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it .
071227 And you are the body of Christ, and members in part.
071228 And God set some in the church, firstly, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers, then works of power, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, kinds of languages.
071229 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of power?
071230 Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak languages? Do all interpret?
071231 But zealously strive after the better gifts. And yet I show to you a more excellent way.
071301 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I have become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.
071302 And though I have prophecies, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so as to move mountains, and do not have charity, I am nothing.
071303 And though I give out all my goods to feed the poor , and though I deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, I am profited nothing.
071304 Charity has patience, is kind; charity is not envious, is not vain, is not puffed up;
071305 does not behave indecently, does not seek her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil.
071306 Charity does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth,
071307 quietly covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
071308 Charity never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will be abolished; if tongues, they shall cease; if knowledge, it will be abolished.
071309 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
071310 But when the perfect thing comes, then that which is in part will be caused to cease.
071311 When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I thought as an infant, I reasoned as an infant. But when I became a man, I did away with the things of an infant.
071312 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall fully know even as I also am fully known.
071313 And now faith, hope, charity, these three remain; but the greatest of these is charity.
071401 Follow after charity and desire spiritual things , but rather that you may prophesy.
071402 For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. For no one hears, but in spirit he speaks mysteries.
071403 But he who prophesies speaks to men for building up, and exhortation, and comfort.
071404 The one speaking in a tongue builds himself up, but he prophesying builds up a church.
071405 I wish all of you to speak in languages, but rather that you may prophesy; for greater is he prophesying than he speaking in tongues, unless he interpret so that the church may receive building up.
071406 But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?
071407 Yet lifeless things giving a sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the sound, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?
071408 For also if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?
071409 So also you, if you do not give a clear word through the language, how will it be known what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air.
071410 So it may be many kinds of sounds are in the world, and not one is without a distinct sound.
071411 Therefore if I do not know the power of the sound, I will be a foreigner to him speaking, and he speaking will be a foreigner to me.
071412 Even so you, since you are zealots of spiritual things , seek to build up the church, in order that you may abound
071413 So then he speaking in a language, let him pray that he may interpret.
071414 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
071415 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.
071416 Else, if you bless in the spirit, he occupying the place of the unlearned, how will he say the amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you say?
071417 For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not built up.
071418 I thank my God that I speak more languages than all of you;
071419 yet in a church I desire to speak five words with my mind, so that I might also teach others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
071420 Brothers, do not be children in your minds, but in malice be like infants, and in your minds be mature.
071421 In the law it is written, "By other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people, and even so they will not hear Me, says the Lord."
071422 So that tongues are not a sign to those who believe, but to those who do not believe. But prophesying is not to those who do not believe, but to those who believe.
071423 Therefore if the whole church has come together, and all speak in languages, and if uninstructed ones or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you rave?
071424 But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or one not instructed comes, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.
071425 And so the secrets of his heart become revealed. And so, falling down on his face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you.
071426 Then how is it, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be for building up.
071427 If one speaks in a language, let it be by two, or at the most three, and in succession. And let one interpret.
071428 But if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in a church; and let him speak to himself and to God.
071429 And if there are two or three prophets, let them speak, and let the others judge.
071430 If a revelation is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent.
071431 For you may all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be comforted.
071432 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
071433 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
071434 Let your women be silent in the churches; for it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be in subjection, as the Law also says.
071435 And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in a church.
071436 Or did the Word of God go out from you? Or did it reach only to you?
071437 If anyone thinks to be a prophet, or a spiritual one, let him recognize the things I write to you, that they are a commandment of the Lord.
071438 But if any is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
071439 So then, brothers, seek to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in languages.
071440 Let all things be done decently and in order.
071501 And, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and in which you stand;
071502 by which you also are being kept safe, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
071503 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures,
071504 and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures;
071505 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the Twelve.
071506 Afterward He was seen by over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain until this present day, but also some fell asleep.
071507 Afterward He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.
071508 And last of all He was seen by me also, as one born out of time.
071509 For I am the least of the apostles and am not sufficient to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
071510 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace which was toward me has not been without fruit, but I labored more abundantly than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God with me.
071511 Therefore whether it was I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
071512 But if Christ is proclaimed, that He was raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
071513 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.
071514 And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is worthless, and your faith is also worthless.
071515 And we are also found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified of God that He raised Christ; whom He did not raise if the dead are not raised.
071516 For if the dead are not raised, then Christ is not raised.
071517 And if Christ is not raised, your faith is foolish; you are yet in your sins.
071518 Then also those that fell asleep in Christ were lost.
071519 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
071520 But now Christ has risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruit of those who slept.
071521 For since death is through man, the resurrection of the dead also is through a Man.
071522 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all will be made alive.
071523 But each in his own order: Christ the first-fruit, and afterward they who are Christ's at His coming;
071524 then is the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father; when He makes to cease all rule and all authority and power.
071525 for it is right for Him to reign until He has put all the enemies under His feet.
071526 The last enemy made to cease is death.
071527 For He put all things under His feet. But when He says that all things have been put under His feet , it is plain that it excepts Him who has put all things under Him.
071528 But when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subject to Him who has subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all things in all.
071529 Otherwise, what will they do, those being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not at all raised, why indeed are they baptized on behalf of the dead?
071530 And why are we also in danger every hour?
071531 Day by day I die, by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
071532 If according to man I fought with beasts in Ephesus, what advantage is to me if the dead are not raised? "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!"
071533 Do not be deceived; evil companionships corrupt good habits.
071534 Be righteously awake, and sin not; for some have ignorance of God. I speak this to your shame.
071535 But someone will say, How are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come?
071536 Foolish one! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.
071537 And what you sow, you do not sow the body that is going to be, but a bare grain (perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest).
071538 And God gives it a body as it has pleased Him, and to each of the seeds its own body.
071539 All flesh is not the same flesh; but one kind of flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fish, and another of birds.
071540 There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly is truly different, and that of the earthly different;
071541 one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.
071542 So also the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;
071543 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
071544 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
071545 And so it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living soul," the last Adam was a life-giving Spirit.
071546 But not the spiritual first, but the natural; afterward the spiritual.
071547 The first man was out of earth, earthy; the second Man was the Lord from Heaven.
071548 Such the earthy man , such also the earthy ones. And such the heavenly Man , such also the heavenly ones.
071549 And according as we bore the image of the earthy man , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man .
071550 And I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.
071551 Behold, I speak a mystery to you; we shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed;
071552 in a moment, in a glance of an eye, at the last trumpet. For a trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall all be changed.
071553 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
071554 But when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and when this mortal shall put on immortality, then will take place the word that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory.
071555 O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?"
071556 The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.
071557 But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
071558 So that, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not without fruit in the Lord.
071601 And concerning the collection for the saints, as I charged the churches of Galatia, so also you do.
071602 On the first of the sabbaths let each of you put by himself, storing up what ever he is prospered, so that there may be no collections when I come.
071603 And when I come, whomever you shall approve by your letters, I will send them to bring your gift to Jerusalem.
071604 And if it is suitable for me to go also, they shall go with me.
071605 But I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia; for I am going through Macedonia.
071606 And it may be that I will stay with you, and even spend the winter with you, so that you may set me forward wherever I go.
071607 For I do not desire to see you now in passage, but I am hoping to stay some time with you, if the Lord permits.
071608 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost.
071609 For a great and effective door opened to me, and many are opposing.
071610 But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he works the work of the Lord, even as I do .
071611 Therefore let not any despise him, but set him forward in peace, so that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brothers.
071612 As regards our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not altogether his will that he come now. But he will come when he has opportunity.
071613 Watch! Stand fast in the faith! Be men! Be strong!
071614 Let all your things be done in charity.
071615 But I exhort you, brothers. You know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruit of Achaia, and they appointed themselves to ministry to the saints.
071616 See that you also submit to such ones, and to everyone working and laboring with me .
071617 I am glad at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; for these supplied your lack.
071618 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours; then acknowledge such ones.
071619 The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
071620 All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
071621 The salutation of Paul with my own hand.
071622 If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. The Lord comes!
071623 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
071624 Let my love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
080101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia.
080102 Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
080103 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,
080104 He comforting us in all our trouble, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in every trouble, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
080105 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.
080106 And if we are troubled, it is for your consolation and salvation, being worked out in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer; if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
080107 And our hope of you is certain, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the consolation.
080108 For, brothers, we would not have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength; so much so that we despaired even of life.
080109 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;
080110 who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we trust that He will yet deliver us ,
080111 with you also helping together by prayer for us, so that the gracious gift by many persons be the cause of thanksgiving through many for us.
080112 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity; not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God; we have had our conduct in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
080113 For we write no other things to you than what you read or recognize, and I trust you shall recognize them even to the end,
080114 even as you have recognized us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
080115 And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, so that you might have a second benefit,
080116 and to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and to be brought on my way toward Judea by you.
080117 Then purposing this, did I indeed use lightness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose them according to the flesh, so that with me there should be yes, yes, and no, no?
080118 But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no.
080119 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us; by me and Silas and Timothy; was not yes and no, but in Him was, yes!
080120 For all the promises of God in Him are yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God by us.
080121 But He confirming us and anointing us with you in Christ is God.
080122 And He has sealed us and having given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
080123 And I call God as witness to my soul that in order to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.
080124 Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy; for by faith you stand.
080201 But I determined this within myself, that I would not come to you again in grief.
080202 For if I make you sorry, who then is he who makes me glad, but the same who has been made sorry by me?
080203 And I wrote this to you, lest when I came I should have sorrow from the ones of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
080204 For out of much trouble and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.
080205 But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, except in part; so that I not overbear all of you.
080206 This punishment by the majority is enough for such a one;
080207 so that, on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overwhelming sorrow.
080208 So I beseech you to confirm your love toward him.
080209 For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.
080210 But to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive . For if I forgave anything, for your sakes I forgave it to him in the person of Christ;
080211 so that we should not be overreached by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his devices.
080212 And, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,
080213 I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother. But taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.
080214 Now thanks be to God, who always causes us to triumph in Christ, and He revealing through us the odor of the knowledge of Him in every place.
080215 For we are to God a sweet savor of Christ, in those being saved, and in those being lost;
080216 to the one we are the savor of death to death, and to the other we are the savor of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?
080217 For we are not as many, hawking the Word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.
080301 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, like some, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?
080302 You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men,
080303 it having been made plain that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, not having been written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but in fleshly tablets of the heart.
080304 And we have such trust through Christ toward God,
080305 not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God;
080306 who also has made us able ministers of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit makes alive.
080307 But if the ministry of death, having been engraved in letters in stone was with glory (so that the sons of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses because of the glory of his face), which was being done away;
080308 shall not the ministry of the Spirit be with more glory?
080309 For if the ministry of condemnation is glorious, much more does the ministry of righteousness exceed in glory.
080310 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels.
080311 For if that which has been done away was glorious, much more that which remains is glorious.
080312 Then since we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech.
080313 And we are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of the thing being done away.
080314 (But their thoughts were blinded; for until the present the same veil remains on the reading of the old covenant, not taken away.) But this veil has been done away in Christ.
080315 But until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.
080316 But whenever it turns to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.
080317 And the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty.
080318 But we all, with our face having been unveiled, having beheld the glory of the Lord as in a mirror, are being changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord Spirit.
080401 Therefore since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not faint.
080402 But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the Word of God, but by the revelation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
080403 But also if our gospel is hidden, it is hidden to those being lost,
080404 in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving ones, so that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ (who is the image of God) should not dawn on them.
080405 For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
080406 For it is God who said, "Out of darkness Light shall shine;" who shone in our hearts to give the brightness of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
080407 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us;
080408 in every way having been troubled, but not having been hemmed in; having been perplexed, but not utterly at a loss;
080409 having been persecuted, but not having been forsaken; having been thrown down, but not having been destroyed;
080410 always bearing about the dying of the Lord Jesus in the body, so that the life of Jesus also might be revealed in our body.
080411 For we who live are always being delivered to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus might also be revealed in our body.
080412 So then death works in us, but life in you.
080413 For we, having the same spirit of faith (according as it is written, "I believed, and therefore I have spoken"); we also believed and therefore speak,
080414 knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus shall also raise us up by Jesus, and shall present us with you.
080415 For all things are for your sake, so that the superabounding grace might be made to abound through the thanksgiving of the greater number, to the glory of God.
080416 For this cause we do not faint; but though our outward man perishes, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.
080417 For the lightness of our present affliction works out for us a far more excellent eternal weight of glory,
080418 we not considering the things which are seen, but the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are not lasting, but the things which are not seen are everlasting.
080501 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
080502 For indeed in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our dwelling-place out of Heaven;
080503 if indeed in being clothed, we shall not be found naked.
080504 For we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened; inasmuch as we do not wish to be unclothed, but to be clothed, so that the mortal might be swallowed up by the life.
080505 And He who has worked in us for this same thing is God, who also is giving to us the earnest of the Spirit.
080506 Then being always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord;
080507 for we walk by faith, not by sight;
080508 then we are confident and we are pleased rather to go away from home out of the body, and to come home to the Lord.
080509 Therefore we are also laboring to be well-pleasing to Him, whether at home or away from home.
080510 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive the things done through the body, according to that which he has done, whether good or bad.
080511 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men. But we are revealed to God, and I trust also that we are revealed in your consciences.
080512 For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but are giving you occasion to glory on our behalf, so that you may have it to answer those boasting in appearance, and not in heart.
080513 For if we are out of our mind, it is to God; or if we are in our senses, it is for you.
080514 For the love of Christ constrains us, judging this, that if one died for all, then all died;
080515 and He died for all, that the living ones may live no more to themselves, but to Him who died for them and having been raised.
080516 So as we now know no one according to flesh, but even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we no longer know Him so.
080517 So that if any one is in Christ, that one is a new creature; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.
080518 And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
080519 whereas God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and putting the word of reconciliation in us.
080520 Then we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as God exhorting through us, we beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
080521 For He has made Him who knew no sin, to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
080601 But working together, we also call on you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
080602 (For He says, "In an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation, I helped you;" Behold, now is the accepted time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.)
080603 We are in nothing giving cause of stumbling, in no way, so that the ministry may not be blamed,
080604 but in everything commending ourselves as God's servants, in much patience, in troubles, in emergencies, in distresses,
080605 in stripes, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
080606 in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
080607 in the word of truth, in the power of God, through the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
080608 through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true;
080609 as unknown and yet well known; as dying and, behold, we live; as chastened and not killed;
080610 as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
080611 O Corinthians, our mouth is opened to you, our heart has been enlarged.
080612 You are not restrained in us, but you are restrained in your own affections.
080613 But for the same reward, (I speak as to children), you also be enlarged.
080614 Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship does righteousness have with lawlessness? And what partnership does light have with darkness?
080615 And what agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?
080616 And what agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said, "I will dwell in them and walk among them ; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
080617 Therefore come out from among them and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch the unclean thing . And I will receive you
080618 and I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
080701 Then having these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilements of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
080702 Make room for us. We wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we overreached no one.
080703 I do not speak this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts for us to die together, and to live together.
080704 My boldness of speech is great toward you; my glorying on your behalf is much. I have been filled with comfort, I am overflowing with joy on all our trouble.
080705 For, indeed, coming into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but being troubled in every way, with fightings on the outside, and fears on the inside.
080706 But He who comforts the lowly comforted us by the coming of Titus.
080707 And not only by his coming, but by the comfort with which he was comforted over you, telling us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.
080708 For even if I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret; if indeed I did regret; for I see that that letter grieved you for an hour.
080709 Now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you grieved to repentance. For you were grieved according to God, so that you might suffer loss by nothing in us.
080710 For the grief according to God works repentance to salvation, not to be regretted, but the grief of the world works out death.
080711 For behold this same thing (you being grieved according to God); how much it worked out earnestness in you; but also defense; but also indignation; but also fear; but also desire; but also zeal; but also vengeance! In everything you approved yourselves to be clear in the matter.
080712 Then, though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered wrong, but for the sake of revealing our earnestness on your behalf, for you before God.
080713 Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort, and we rather rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
080714 For if I have boasted anything about you to him, I was not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting as to Titus became truth.
080715 And his tender feelings are more abundant toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, as you received him with fear and trembling.
080716 Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.
080801 And, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given among the churches of Macedonia;
080802 that in much testing of trouble, the overflowing of their joy, and the depth of their poverty, abounded to the riches of their generosity.
080803 For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability; they gave willingly;
080804 with much beseeching, begging us that they might receive of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints.
080805 And not as we hoped, but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God,
080806 for us to call on Titus, that even as he began before, so he would also complete this grace to you also.
080807 But even as you abound in everything, in faith, and in word, and in knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love to us; you should abound in this grace also.
080808 I do not speak according to command, but through the eagerness of others, and testing the trueness of your love.
080809 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor, in order that you might be made rich through His poverty.
080810 And in this I give my judgment; for this is profitable for you, who began before, not only to do, but also to be willing a year ago.
080811 But now also finish the doing of it , so that, as there was a readiness to will, so also the finishing, giving out of what you have.
080812 For if the eagerness is present, it is acceptable according to what one has, and not according to what one does not have.
080813 For it is not that others may have ease, but you trouble;
080814 but by equality in the present time; your abundance for their need, that their abundance also may be for your need; so that there may be equality;
080815 as it is written, "He gathering much, he had nothing left over; and he gathering little did not have less."
080816 But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
080817 For indeed he accepted the entreaty. But being more earnest, of his own accord he went to you.
080818 And we have sent with him the brothers whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;
080819 and not only so , but also he having been chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself, and as a witness of your eager mind;
080820 avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us;
080821 providing for honest things, not only before the Lord, but also before men.
080822 And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest by the great confidence which I have in you.
080823 If anyone inquires of Titus, he is my partner and fellow-worker for you, or of our brothers, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
080824 Therefore show them a proof of your love and of our boasting toward you in the presence of the churches.
080901 For indeed regarding the ministry to the saints, it is not necessary for me to write to you.
080902 For I know your eagerness, of which I boast to Macedonia on your behalf, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has aroused the greater number.
080903 Yet I sent the brothers, lest our boasting (which is on your behalf) should not be in vain, that, as I said, you may be ready.
080904 I say this lest perhaps Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared. We (not to say you) would then be put to shame in this confident boasting.
080905 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers that they would go forward to you, and make up beforehand your blessing, it having been promised that this would be ready, thus as a matter of blessing, and not as of covetousness.
080906 But I say this, He who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully.
080907 Each one, as he purposes in his heart, let him give ; not of grief, or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.
080908 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that in everything, always having all self-sufficiency, you may abound to every good work;
080909 As it is written, "He scattered; he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever."
080910 Now He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, may He supply and multiply your seed, and increase the fruits of your righteousness
080911 you being enriched in everything to all generosity, which works out thanksgiving to God through us.
080912 For the ministry of this service not only supplies the things lacking of the saints, but also multiplying through many thanksgivings to God,
080913 through the proof of this ministry they glorify God for your freely expressed submission to the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of the fellowship toward them and toward all,
080914 and in their prayer for you, who long after you, because of the exceeding grace of God on you.
080915 Thanks be to God for His unspeakable free gift.
081001 And I myself, Paul, beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ; I, who indeed to look upon am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.
081002 But I ask, not being present, that I may be bold with the confidence which I think to be daring against some, who thought of us as walking according to flesh.
081003 For though walking about in flesh, we do not war according to flesh.
081004 For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds,
081005 pulling down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought into the obedience of Christ;
081006 and having readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
081007 Do you look at things according to appearance? If anyone has persuaded himself that he is Christ's, let him think this again as to himself, that as he is Christ's, even so we are Christ's.
081008 For even if I also should boast somewhat more fully of our authority (which the Lord has given us for building up, and not for pulling you down) I will not be put to shame;
081009 so that I might not seem to terrify you by letters.
081010 For indeed they say, the letters are weighty and powerful, but the bodily presence is weak, and his speech is contemptible.
081011 Let such a one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters, being absent, such we will be also in deed when we are present.
081012 For we do not dare to rank or compare ourselves with some of the ones commending themselves. But they, measuring themselves among themselves, and comparing themselves to themselves, are not perceptive.
081013 But we will not boast beyond measure, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure distributed to us, to reach even to you.
081014 For we do not overstretch ourselves as though not reaching to you. For we also came to you in the gospel of Christ;
081015 not boasting beyond measure in the labors of others, but having hope that the growing faith among you will be increased according to our rule, to overflowing;
081016 to preach the gospel in that beyond you, and not to boast in another's rule in things made ready.
081017 But he who glories, let him glory in the Lord.
081018 For not he who commends himself is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.
081101 I would that you were bearing with me a little in foolishness; but indeed bear with me.
081102 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy. For I have espoused you to one Man, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
081103 But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the simplicity due to Christ.
081104 For if, indeed, the one coming proclaims another Jesus, whom we have not proclaimed, or if you receive another spirit, which you did not receive, or another gospel, which you never accepted, you might well endure these .
081105 For I judge myself to have come behind the highest apostles in nothing.
081106 But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge; but in every way I have been clearly revealed to you in all things.
081107 Or did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?
081108 I stripped other churches, taking wages for the serving of you.
081109 And being present with you, and in need, I was not a burden to anyone. For the brothers from Macedonia made up completely my need. And in every way I have kept myself from being burdensome to you , and I will keep myself.
081110 The truth of Christ is in me that this boasting shall not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.
081111 Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.
081112 But what I do, that I will do, so that I may cut off occasion from those who desire occasion; so that in the thing in which they boast, they may be found even as we.
081113 For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
081114 Did not even Satan marvelously transform himself into an angel of light?
081115 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.
081116 Again I say, Let no one think me foolish. If otherwise, yet receive me as foolish, so that I may also boast a little.
081117 What I speak, I do not speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this boldness of boasting.
081118 Since many glory according to the flesh, I also will boast.
081119 For you gladly bear with fools, being wise.
081120 For you endure if anyone enslaves you, if anyone devours, if anyone takes from you , if anyone exalts himself, if anyone strikes you in the face.
081121 I speak according to dishonor, as though we have been weak. But in whatever anyone dares (I speak foolishly), I also dare.
081122 Are they Hebrews? I also! Are they Israelites? I also! Are they the seed of Abraham? I also!
081123 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as beside myself,) I am more! I have been in labors more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in prisons more, in deaths many times.
081124 Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one.
081125 Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a night and a day in the deep.
081126 I have been in travels often; in dangers from waters; in dangers from robbers; in dangers from my race; in dangers from the heathen; in dangers in the city; in dangers in the wilderness; in dangers on the sea; in dangers among false brothers.
081127 I have been in hardship and toil; often in watchings; in hunger and thirst; often in fastings; in cold and nakedness;
081128 besides the things outside conspiring against me daily, the care of all the churches.
081129 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn?
081130 If it is right to boast, I will boast of the things of my weakness.
081131 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I do not lie.
081132 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes, desiring to lay hold of me.
081133 And I was let down in a basket through a window through the wall, and escaped their hands.
081201 Indeed, it is not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
081202 I know a man in Christ fourteen years before (whether in the body, I do not know; or outside of the body, I do not know; God knows) such a one was caught up to the third Heaven.
081203 And I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I do not know; God knows),
081204 that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to utter.
081205 I will glory of such a one, yet I will not boast on my behalf, except in my weaknesses.
081206 For if I desire to boast, I shall not be foolish. For I will speak the truth. But I spare, lest anyone should think of me as being beyond what he sees me, or hears of me;
081207 and by the surpassing revelations, lest I be made haughty, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be made haughty.
081208 For this thing I besought the Lord three times, that it might depart from me.
081209 And He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may overshadow me.
081210 Therefore I am pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.
081211 I have become foolish boasting. You compelled me. For I ought to be commended by you. For I lacked nothing of the highest apostles, if even I am nothing.
081212 Truly the signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patience, in miracles and in wonders, and by works of power.
081213 For what is it in which you were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong.
081214 Behold, a third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not burden you, for I do not seek your things, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.
081215 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls, even if loving you more and more, I am loved the less.
081216 But let it be so, I did not burden you. But being crafty, I caught you with bait.
081217 By any whom I have sent to you, did I overreach you by him?
081218 I begged Titus and sent with him the brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?
081219 Again, do you think we are defending ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ, but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your building up.
081220 For I fear, lest somehow coming I might not find you as I wish, and that I shall be found by you such as you might not wish; lest somehow there be strifes, envyings, angers, contentions, backbitings, whisperings, proud thoughts, tumults;
081221 lest in my coming again my God will humble me with you; and I shall mourn many who have already sinned, and not repenting over the uncleanness, and fornication, and lustfulness which they have practiced.
081301 I am coming to you this third time . In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.
081302 I told you before, and I say beforehand, as being present the second time and being absent now. I write to those who sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.
081303 Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me (who is not weak toward you, but is powerful in you;
081304 for even if He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For indeed even we are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you),
081305 examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith, prove your own selves. Do you not know your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are reprobates?
081306 But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates.
081307 But I pray to God for you not to do evil, none. And not that we may appear approved, but that you should do the good things, though we are deemed to be reprobates.
081308 For we have no power against the truth, but for the truth.
081309 For we are glad when we are weak, and you are powerful. But we pray also for this, your perfection.
081310 Therefore I write these things while absent, lest being present I may not deal sharply with you according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.
081311 Finally, brothers, rejoice. Perfect yourselves; encourage yourselves; mind the same thing; be at peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.
081312 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
081313 All the saints greet you.
081314 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
090101 Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),
090102 and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia.
090103 Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
090104 who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our Father,
090105 to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
090106 I marvel that you so soon are being moved away from Him who called you into the grace of Christ, to another gospel,
090107 which is not another, but some are troubling you, and desiring to pervert the gospel of Christ.
090108 But even if we or an angel from Heaven preach a gospel to you beside what we preached to you, let him be accursed.
090109 As we said before, and now I say again, If anyone preaches a gospel to you beside what you have received, let him be accursed.
090110 For now do I persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I yet pleased men, I would not be a servant of Christ.
090111 And, brothers, I make known to you the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.
090112 For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it except by a revelation of Jesus Christ.
090113 For you heard my manner of life when I was in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God with surpassing zeal , and ravaged it.
090114 And I progressed in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being much more a zealot of the traditions of my fathers.
090115 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and having called me by His grace,
090116 to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the nations, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood;
090117 Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.
090118 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.
090119 But I saw no other of the apostles, except James the Lord's brother.
090120 And what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.
090121 Then I went into the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,
090122 and was unknown by face to the churches of Judea in Christ.
090123 But only they were hearing that he who then persecuted us, now preaches the faith which he once ravaged.
090124 And they glorified God in me.
090201 Then through fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.
090202 And I went up by revelation. And I put before them the gospel which I proclaim in the nations, but privately to those seeming to be pillars, lest I run, or I ran, into vanity.
090203 (But not even Titus, the one with me, a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.)
090204 But because of those false brothers stealing in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus; they desiring to enslave us;
090205 to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
090206 But from those who seemed to be something (what kind they were then does not matter to me; God does not accept the face of man), for those seeming important conferred nothing to me.
090207 But on the contrary, seeing that I have been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter to the circumcision;
090208 for He working in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision also worked in me to the nations.
090209 and knowing the grace given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave right hands of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we go to the nations, but they to the circumcision.
090210 Only they asked that we remember the poor, which very thing I was eager to do.
090211 But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was to be blamed.
090212 For before some came from James, he ate with the nations. But when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.
090213 And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him, so as even Barnabas was led away with their dissembling.
090214 But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before all, If you, being a Jew, live as a Gentile, and not as the Jews, why do you compel the nations to judaize?
090215 We Jews by nature, and not sinners of the nations,
090216 knowing that a man is not justified by works of the Law, but through faith in Jesus Christ; even we believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith in Christ, and not by works of the Law. For all flesh will not be justified by works of law.
090217 But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we also were found to be sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? Let it not be said !
090218 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I confirm myself as a transgressor.
090219 For through the Law I died to the law, that I might live to God.
090220 I have been crucified with Christ, and I live; yet no longer I, but Christ lives in me. And that life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith toward the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself on my behalf.
090221 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness is through law, then Christ died without cause.
090301 O foolish Galatians, who bewitched you not to obey the truth, to whom before your eyes Jesus Christ was written among you crucified?
090302 This only I would learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
090303 Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, do you now perfect yourself in the flesh?
090304 Did you suffer so many things in vain, if indeed it is even in vain?
090305 Then He supplying the Spirit to you and working powerful works in you, is it by works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
090306 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
090307 Therefore know that those of faith, these are the sons of Abraham.
090308 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations through faith, preached the gospel before to Abraham, saying , "In you shall all nations be blessed."
090309 So then those of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
090310 For as many as are out of works of the Law, these are under a curse; for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them."
090311 But that no one is justified by the Law in the sight of God is clear, for, "The just shall live by faith."
090312 But the Law is not of faith; but, "The man who does these things shall live in them."
090313 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us (for it is written, "Cursed is everyone having been hanged on a tree");
090314 so that the blessing of Abraham might be to the nations in Jesus Christ, and that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
090315 Brothers, I speak according to man, a covenant having been ratified, even among mankind, no one sets aside or adds to it .
090316 And to Abraham and to his Seed the promises were spoken. It does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, "And to your Seed," which is Christ.
090317 And I say this, A covenant having been ratified by God in Christ, the Law (coming into being four hundred and thirty years after) does not annul the promise, so as to abolish it.
090318 For if the inheritance is of Law, it is no more of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by way of promise.
090319 Why then the Law? It was added because of transgressions, until the Seed should come to those to whom it had been promised, being ordained through angels in the Mediator's hand.
090320 But the Mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
090321 Is the Law then against the promises of God? Let it not be said ! For if a law had been given which could have given life, indeed righteousness would have been out of Law.
090322 But the Scripture shut up all under sin, so that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
090323 But before faith came, we were kept under Law, having been shut up to the faith about to be revealed.
090324 So that the Law has become a trainer of us until Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
090325 But faith coming, we are no longer under a trainer.
090326 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
090327 For as many as were baptized into Christ, you put on Christ.
090328 There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is no male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
090329 And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise.
090401 But I say, Over so long a time the heir is an infant, he does not differ from a slave, though being lord of all;
090402 but he is under guardians and housemasters until the term appointed before by the father.
090403 Even so we, when we were infants, were in bondage under the elements of the world.
090404 But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, coming into being out of a woman, having come under Law,
090405 that He might redeem those under Law, so that we might receive the adoption of sons.
090406 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
090407 So that you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.
090408 But then, indeed, not knowing God, you served as slaves to those not by nature being gods.
090409 But now, knowing God, but rather are known by God, how do you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements to which you again desire to slave anew?
090410 You observe days and months and times and years.
090411 I fear for you, lest somehow I have labored among you in vain.
090412 Brothers, I beseech you, be as I am ; for I am as you. You have not injured me at all.
090413 But you know that through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you before,
090414 and you did not despise my temptation in my flesh, nor did you spurn it . But you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
090415 What then was your blessedness? For I bear you record that, if you were able, plucking out your eyes, you would have given them to me.
090416 So then did I become your enemy speaking to you the truth?
090417 They are zealous for you, but not well. But they only desire to shut you out, that you be zealous to them.
090418 But it is good to be zealous always in a good thing , and not only in my being present with you.
090419 My children, for whom I again travail until Christ should be formed in you,
090420 even now I desired to be present with you, and to change my voice; for I am in doubt as to you.
090421 Tell me, those desiring to be under Law, do you not hear the Law?
090422 For it is written: Abraham had two sons, the one out of the slave-woman, and one out of the free woman.
090423 But, indeed, he out of the slave-woman has been born according to flesh, and he out of the free woman through the promise;
090424 which things are being allegorized; for these are the two covenants, one indeed from Mount Sinai bringing forth to slavery, which is Hagar.
090425 For Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in slavery with her children.
090426 But the Jerusalem from above is free, who is the mother of us all.
090427 For it is written, "Rejoice, barren one not bearing; break forth and shout, you not travailing; for more are the children of the desolate than she having the husband."
090428 But brothers, we, like Isaac, are children of promise.
090429 But then even as he born according to flesh persecuted him born according to the Spirit, so it is also now.
090430 But what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the slave-woman and her son; for in no way shall the son of the slave-woman inherit with the son of the free woman."
090431 Then, brothers, we are not children of a slave-woman, but of the free woman.
090501 Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and do not again be held with the yoke of bondage.
090502 Behold, I, Paul, say to you that if you are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
090503 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do all the Law,
090504 you who are justified by Law are deprived of all effect from Christ; you fell from grace.
090505 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness out of faith.
090506 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any strength, but faith working through love.
090507 You were running well. Who hindered you that you do not obey the truth?
090508 This persuasion is not from Him who calls you.
090509 A little leaven leavens all the lump.
090510 I have confidence in you in the Lord, that you will think nothing else, but that he troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.
090511 And I, brothers, if I yet proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the offense of the Cross has ceased.
090512 I wish that those causing you to doubt will cut themselves off.
090513 For, brothers, you were called to liberty. Only do not use the liberty for an opening to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
090514 For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
090515 But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not consumed by one another.
090516 I say, then, Walk in the Spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.
090517 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. And these are contrary to one another; lest whatever you may will, these things you do.
090518 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.
090519 Now the works of the flesh are clearly revealed, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lustfulness,
090520 idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, fightings, jealousies, angers, rivalries, divisions, heresies,
090521 envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revelings, and things like these; of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
090522 But the fruit of the Spirit is: love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
090523 meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
090524 But those belonging to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.
090525 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
090526 Let us not become glory-seeking, provoking one another, envying one another.
090601 Brothers, if a man is overtaken in a fault, you the spiritual ones restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.
090602 Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.
090603 For if anyone thinks himself to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.
090604 But let each one prove his own work, and then he alone will have a boast in himself, and not in another.
090605 For each one will bear his own load.
090606 But let him who is taught in the Word share with the one teaching in all good things.
090607 Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that he also will reap.
090608 For he sowing to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh. But he sowing to the Spirit will reap life everlasting from the Spirit.
090609 But we should not lose heart in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we do not faint.
090610 So then as we have time, let us work good toward all, especially toward those of the household of faith.
090611 See in what large letters I write to you with my hand.
090612 As many as desire to look well in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
090613 For they themselves, having been circumcised, do not even keep the Law, but they desire you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.
090614 But may it never be for me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
090615 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any strength, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
090616 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God.
090617 For the rest, let no one give troubles to me, for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus.
090618 Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
100101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus.
100102 Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
100103 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ;
100104 according as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,
100105 having predestined us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
100106 to the praise of the glory of His grace, in which He has made us accepted in the One having been loved.
100107 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace,
100108 which He caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding;
100109 having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,
100110 for an administration of the fullness of times, to head up all things in Christ, both the things in Heaven, and the things on earth, even in Him,
100111 in whom also we have been chosen to an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His own will,
100112 for us to be to the praise of His glory, who previously had trusted in Christ;
100113 in whom also you, hearing the word of truth, the gospel of our salvation, in whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
100114 who is the earnest of our inheritance, to the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.
100115 Therefore I also, hearing of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love to all the saints,
100116 do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
100117 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him,
100118 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what is the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
100119 and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us, the ones believing according to the working of His mighty strength
100120 which He worked in Christ in raising Him from the dead, and He seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies,
100121 far above all principality and authority and power and dominion, and every name being named, not only in this world, but also in the coming age.
100122 And He has put all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church,
100123 which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
100201 And He has made you alive , who were once dead in trespasses and sins,
100202 in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience;
100203 among whom we also had our way of life in times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
100204 But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love with which He loved us
100205 (even when we were dead in sins) has made us alive together with Christ (by grace you are saved),
100206 and has raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,
100207 so that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
100208 For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,
100209 not of works, lest anyone should boast.
100210 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.
100211 Therefore remember that you, the nations, in time past were in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
100212 and that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.
100213 But now in Christ Jesus you who were once afar off are made near by the blood of Christ.
100214 For He is our peace, He making us both one, and He has broken down the middle wall of partition between us ,
100215 having abolished in His flesh the enmity (the Law of commandments contained in ordinances) so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, making peace between them ;
100216 and so that He might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity in Himself.
100217 And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off, and to those who were near.
100218 For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
100219 Now therefore you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
100220 and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone,
100221 in whom every building having been fitly framed together, grows into a holy sanctuary in the Lord;
100222 in whom you also are built together for a dwelling place of God through the Spirit.
100301 For this cause, I, Paul, am the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you nations,
100302 if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me toward you,
100303 that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I wrote before in few words,
100304 by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
100305 which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,
100306 that the nations should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partaker of His promise in Christ through the gospel.
100307 Of this gospel I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of His power.
100308 This grace is given to me ( who am less than the least of all saints) to preach the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ among the nations,
100309 and to bring to light what is the fellowship of the mystery which from eternity has been hidden in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ;
100310 so that now to the rulers and powers in the heavenlies might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
100311 according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;
100312 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through His faith.
100313 For this reason I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
100314 For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
100315 of whom the whole family in Heaven and earth is named,
100316 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man;
100317 that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
100318 may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height,
100319 and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.
100320 Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
100321 to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, forever. Amen.
100401 I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the calling with which you are called,
100402 with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love,
100403 endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
100404 There is one body and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling,
100405 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
100406 one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in you all.
100407 But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
100408 Therefore He says, "When He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive and gave gifts to men."
100409 (Now that He ascended, what is it but that He also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
100410 He who descended is the same also as He who ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.)
100411 And truly He gave some to be apostles, and some to be prophets, and some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,
100412 for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.
100413 And this until we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;
100414 so that we no longer may be infants, tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine, in the dishonesty of men, in cunning craftiness, to the wiles of deceit.
100415 But that you, speaking the truth in love, may in all things grow up to Him who is the Head, even Christ;
100416 from whom the whole body, fitted together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of each part, producing the growth of the body to the edifying of itself in love.
100417 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should not walk from now on as other nations walk, in the vanity of their mind,
100418 having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart.
100419 For they, being past feeling, have given themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
100420 But you have not so learned Christ,
100421 if indeed you have heard Him and were taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus.
100422 For you ought to put off the old man (according to your way of living before) who is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,
100423 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind.
100424 And you should put on the new man, who according to God was created in righteousness and true holiness.
100425 Therefore putting away lying, let each man speak truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.
100426 Be angry, and do not sin. Do not let the sun go down upon your wrath,
100427 neither give place to the Devil.
100428 Let him who stole steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, so that he may have something to give to him who needs.
100429 Let not any filthy word go out of your mouth, but if any is good to building up in respect of need, that it may give grace to the ones hearing.
100430 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you are sealed until the day of redemption.
100431 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and tumult and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.
100432 And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.
100501 Therefore be followers of God, as dear children.
100502 And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given Himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor.
100503 For let fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness not be once named among you, as becomes saints,
100504 neither baseness, foolish talking, jesting, which are not becoming, but rather giving of thanks.
100505 For you know this, that no fornicator, or unclean person, or covetous one (who is an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
100506 Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience.
100507 Therefore do not be partakers with them.
100508 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light
100509 (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
100510 proving what is acceptable to the Lord.
100511 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them .
100512 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret.
100513 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light.
100514 Therefore he says, "Awake, sleeping ones! And arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light."
100515 See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
100516 redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
100517 Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is .
100518 And do not be drunk with wine, in which is excess, but be filled with the Spirit,
100519 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
100520 always giving thanks for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
100521 submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.
100522 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
100523 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body.
100524 Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.
100525 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for it,
100526 that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word,
100527 that He might present it to Himself as the glorious church, without spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that it should be holy and without blemish.
100528 So men ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
100529 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord loves the church.
100530 For we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.
100531 "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two of them shall be one flesh."
100532 This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
100533 But also let everyone of you in particular so love his wife even as himself, and the wife that she defers to her husband.
100601 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
100602 Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise),
100603 so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.
100604 And fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
100605 Slaves, obey your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;
100606 not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,
100607 with good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men
100608 (knowing that whatever good thing he does, he shall receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or a freeman).
100609 And masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening, knowing that your Master also is in Heaven. There is no respect of persons with Him.
100610 Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.
100611 Put on the whole armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
100612 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the world's rulers, of the darkness of this age, against spiritual wickedness in high places .
100613 Therefore take to yourselves the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
100614 Therefore stand, having your loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness
100615 and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
100616 Above all, take the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
100617 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,
100618 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching to this very thing with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.
100619 And pray for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel,
100620 for which I am an ambassador in bonds; so that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
100621 But, so that you also may know my affairs and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things,
100622 whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that you might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts.
100623 Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
100624 Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
110101 Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.
110102 Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
110103 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
110104 always in every prayer of mine making my request for you all with joy
110105 for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
110106 being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,
110107 even as it is righteous for me to think this of you all, because you have me in your heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partakers of my grace.
110108 For God is my witness how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
110109 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and in all perception;
110110 that you may distinguish between things that differ, that you may be sincere and without offense until the day of Jesus Christ,
110111 being filled with the fruits of righteousness through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
110112 But I desire that you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;
110113 so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places .
110114 And most of the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
110115 Some indeed even preach Christ because of envy and strife, and some also of good will.
110116 Those, indeed, preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds.
110117 But these others preach in love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.
110118 What then? Nevertheless, in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached. And I rejoice in this. Yet, also I will rejoice.
110119 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
110120 according to my earnest expectation and hope that I shall be ashamed in nothing, but as always now Christ shall be magnified in my body with all boldness, whether it is by life or by death.
110121 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
110122 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor. Yet I do not know what I shall choose.
110123 For I am pressed together by the two: having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better.
110124 But to remain in the flesh is more needful for you.
110125 And having this confidence, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your advancement and joy of faith,
110126 so that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
110127 Only let your conduct be as becomes the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you, or else am absent, I may hear of your affairs , that you stand fast in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the faith of the gospel,
110128 and terrified in nothing by your adversaries. For this is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
110129 For to you it is given on behalf of Christ not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake,
110130 having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
110201 If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tendernesses and mercies,
110202 then fulfill my joy, that you may be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord and of one mind.
110203 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves.
110204 Do not let each man look upon his own things, but each man also on the things of others.
110205 For let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,
110206 who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God,
110207 but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Himself the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.
110208 And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
110209 Therefore God has highly exalted Him, and has given Him a name which is above every name,
110210 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly ones, and of earthly ones, and of ones under the earth;
110211 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
110212 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, cultivate your own salvation with fear and trembling.
110213 For it is God who works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.
110214 Do all things without murmurings and disputings,
110215 so that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation. Among these you shine as lights in the world,
110216 holding forth the word of life, so that I may rejoice with you in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain nor labored in vain.
110217 Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.
110218 And you also rejoice in the same, and rejoice with me.
110219 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you, so that I also may be of good comfort when I know your state .
110220 For I have no one who is like-minded, who will naturally care for your state .
110221 For all seek their own, not the things which are of Jesus Christ.
110222 But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.
110223 Therefore I hope to send him presently, as soon as I shall see the things about me.
110224 But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.
110225 Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and he who ministered to my wants.
110226 For he longed after you all and was full of heaviness, because you had heard that he had been sick.
110227 For indeed he was sick, coming near death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
110228 Therefore I sent him the more eagerly, so that you may rejoice when you see him again, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
110229 Therefore receive him in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such in honor,
110230 because for the work of Christ he was near death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
110301 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is indeed not grievous to me, but for you it is safe.
110302 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision party.
110303 For we are the circumcision who worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh;
110304 though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks that he has reason to trust in the flesh, I more.
110305 I was circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews. As regards the Law, I was a Pharisee;
110306 concerning zeal, persecuting the church; regarding the righteousness in the Law, blameless.
110307 But whatever things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
110308 But no, rather, I also count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them to be dung, so that I may win Christ
110309 and be found in Him; not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but through the faith of Christ, the righteousness of God by faith,
110310 that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable to His death;
110311 if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.
110312 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I am pressing on, if I may lay hold of that for which I also was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.
110313 My brothers, I do not count myself to have taken possession, but one thing I do , forgetting the things behind and reaching forward to the things before,
110314 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
110315 Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be of this mind. And if in anything you are otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.
110316 Yet, as to what we have already attained, let us walk in the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
110317 Brothers, be imitators together of me, and mark those who walk this way, for you have us for a pattern.
110318 (For many are walking, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ;
110319 whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, those who mind earthly things.)
110320 For our citizenship is in Heaven, from which also we are looking for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
110321 who shall change our body of humiliation so that it may be fashioned like His glorious body, according to the working of His power, even to subdue all things to Himself.
110401 Therefore, my brothers, ones loved and longed for, my joy and crown, stand fast in this way in the Lord, beloved ones.
110402 I beg Euodia and Syntyche that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
110403 And I also beg you, true yoke-fellow, help those women who labored in the gospel with me and with Clement, and others of my fellow-laborers, whose names are in the Book of Life.
110404 Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, Rejoice!
110405 Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.
110406 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
110407 And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
110408 Finally, my brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are right, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, think on these things.
110409 Do those things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me. And the God of peace shall be with you.
110410 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again. Although you indeed did think, but you lacked opportunity.
110411 Not that I speak according to need, for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.
110412 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
110413 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
110414 Yet you did well in sharing my troubles.
110415 Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as regards giving and receiving, except you alone.
110416 For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.
110417 I do not say this because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
110418 But I have all, and abound. I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things which you sent , an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God.
110419 But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
110420 Now unto God and our Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
110421 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
110422 All the saints greet you, most of all those who are of Caesar's household.
110423 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
120101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
120102 to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
120103 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
120104 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love you have to all the saints,
120105 for the hope which is laid up for you in Heaven, of which you heard before in the Word of the truth of the gospel,
120106 which has come to you as it has also in all the world, and it is bearing fruit, even also among you, since the day you heard and fully knew the grace of God in truth,
120107 even as you learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you,
120108 he also having shown your love in the Spirit to us.
120109 For this cause we also, since the day we heard, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
120110 that you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every work and increasing in the knowledge of God,
120111 being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness,
120112 giving thanks to the Father, who has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.
120113 For He has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son;
120114 in whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins.
120115 who is the image of the invisible God, the First-born of all creation.
120116 For all things were created in Him, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created through Him and for Him.
120117 And He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.
120118 And He is the Head of the body, the church, who is the Beginning, the First-born from the dead, that He may be pre-eminent in all things.
120119 For it pleased the Father that in Him all fullness should dwell.
120120 And through Him having made peace through the blood of His cross, it pleased the Father to reconcile all things to Himself through Him, whether the things on earth or the things in Heaven.
120121 And you, who were once alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled
120122 in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish, and without charge in His sight,
120123 if indeed you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard and which was proclaimed in all the creation under Heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister,
120124 who now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and I fill up the things lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, on behalf of His body, which is the church;
120125 of which I became a minister, according to the administration of God given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;
120126 the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints.
120127 For to them God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,
120128 whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, so that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
120129 For which I also labor, striving according to the working of Him who works in me in power.
120201 For I want you to know what a great conflict I have for you and those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,
120202 that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
120203 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
120204 And I say this that not anyone should beguile you with enticing words.
120205 For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
120206 Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,
120207 rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.
120208 Beware lest anyone rob you through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.
120209 For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
120210 And you are complete in Him, who is the Head of all principality and power,
120211 in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ,
120212 buried with Him in baptism, in whom also you were raised through the faith of the working of God, raising Him from the dead.
120213 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,
120214 blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.
120215 Having stripped rulers and authorities, He made a show of them publicly, triumphing over them in it.
120216 Therefore let no one judge you in food or in drink, or in respect of a feast, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths.
120217 For these are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.
120218 Let no one defraud you, delighting in humility and worship of the angels, intruding into things which he has not seen, without a cause being vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
120219 and not holding the Head, from whom all the body, having been supplied through the joints and bands, and having been joined together, will grow with the growth of God.
120220 If then you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to its ordinances:
120221 touch not, taste not, handle not;
120222 which things are all for corruption in the using, according to the commands and doctrines of men?
120223 These things indeed have a reputation of wisdom in self-imposed worship and humility, and unsparing severity of the body, not in any honor for the satisfying of the flesh.
120301 If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.
120302 Be mindful of things above, not on things on the earth.
120303 For you died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God.
120304 When Christ our Life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.
120305 Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness (which is idolatry),
120306 on account of which things' sake the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience,
120307 among whom you also once walked, when you lived in these.
120308 But now also put off all these things: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, shameful speech out of your mouth.
120309 Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with his deeds
120310 and having put on the new, having been renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,
120311 where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, slave or freeman, but Christ is all things in all.
120312 Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender feelings of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering,
120313 forbearing one another and forgiving yourselves, if anyone has a complaint against any. As Christ forgave you, so also you do .
120314 And above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.
120315 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which you also are called in one body, and be thankful.
120316 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
120317 And everything, whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.
120318 Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as is becoming in the Lord.
120319 Husbands, love your wives, and do not be bitter against them.
120320 Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.
120321 Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they be discouraged.
120322 Slaves, obey your masters according to the flesh in all things; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.
120323 And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men;
120324 knowing that from the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance. For you serve the Lord Christ.
120325 But he who does wrong shall receive justice for the wrong which he did, and there is no respect of persons.
120401 Masters, give to your slaves what is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in Heaven.
120402 Continue in prayer and watch in it with thanksgiving,
120403 praying together about us also, that God may open to us a door of the Word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I also have been bound,
120404 that I may make it clear, as I ought to speak.
120405 Walk in wisdom toward those on the outside, redeeming the time.
120406 Let your speech be always with grace, having been seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.
120407 Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord, will make known to you all things about me.
120408 I sent him to you for this very purpose, that he might know the things about you, and that he might comfort your hearts,
120409 along with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known to you all things here.
120410 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (regarding whom you received commandments; if he comes to you, receive him),
120411 and greetings from Jesus, who is called Justus, those being of the circumcision. These alone are my fellow-workers for the kingdom of God, who became a comfort to me.
120412 Epaphras greets you, he being of you, a servant of Christ, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
120413 For I bear him record that he has a great zeal for you and for those who are in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis.
120414 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
120415 Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house.
120416 And when this letter is read before you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the letter of Laodicea.
120417 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.
120418 The salutation of Paul, by my own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
130101 Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians, in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
130102 We give thanks to God for you always, making mention of you in our prayers,
130103 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father,
130104 knowing, beloved brothers, your election of God.
130105 For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.
130106 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, welcoming the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,
130107 so that you were examples to all who believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
130108 For from you the Word of the Lord sounded out, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to speak anything.
130109 For they themselves witness what kind of entrance we had to you, even how you turned from idols to God in order to serve the living and true God,
130110 and to wait for His Son from Heaven (whom He raised from the dead), Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.
130201 For, my brothers, you yourselves know our coming in to you, that it was not in vain.
130202 But also suffering before, being insulted in Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much agony.
130203 For our exhortation to you was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile,
130204 but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tries our hearts.
130205 For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor with pretense of covetousness; God is witness.
130206 Nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others, being able to be so with heaviness, as apostles of Christ.
130207 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse warmly cherishes her children.
130208 So affectionately longing for you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls, because you have become beloved to us.
130209 For, brothers, you remember our labor and toil. For laboring night and day in order not to put a burden on any one of you, we preached the gospel of God to you.
130210 You and God are witnesses how holily and justly and blamelessly we were to you who believe,
130211 even as you know how we exhorted and comforted and testified to each one of you, as a father to his children,
130212 that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to His kingdom and glory.
130213 And for this cause we thank God without ceasing, that when you received the Word of hearing, of God, you welcomed it as the Word of God, not as a word of men, but as it is, truly the Word of God, which also effectually works in you who believe.
130214 For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also have suffered these things by your own countrymen, even as they also by the Jews;
130215 who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, also driving us out and they do not please God and being contrary to all men,
130216 forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always; but the wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.
130217 But, my brothers, when we were taken away from you for an hour's time (in presence, not in heart), more abundantly we were eager with much desire to see your face.
130218 Therefore we desired to come to you, truly I, Paul, both once and twice; but Satan hindered us.
130219 For what is our hope or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are you not even to be in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?
130220 For you are our glory and joy.
130301 Therefore when we could no longer endure, we were pleased to be left at Athens alone.
130302 And we sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith,
130303 so that no one should be drawn aside by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to them.
130304 For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we were going to suffer affliction, as it also happened, even you know.
130305 For this cause, when I could no longer endure, I also sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter may have tempted you and our labor may have been in vain.
130306 But now when Timothy came from you to us and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us (as we also you),
130307 then, my brothers, we were comforted over you, through your faith, even in all our affliction and needs;
130308 for now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.
130309 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God,
130310 night and day praying exceedingly for me to see your face and to perfect the things lacking in your faith?
130311 And may God Himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you.
130312 And may the Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all, even as we also toward you,
130313 in order to establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.
130401 For the rest, then, my brothers, we beseech you and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as you have received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more .
130402 For we know what commands we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
130403 For this is the will of God, your sanctification, for you to abstain from fornication,
130404 each one of you to know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor
130405 (not in the passion of lust, even as the nations who do not know God),
130406 not to go beyond and defraud his brother in this matter (because the Lord is the avenger concerning all these, as we also have forewarned you and testified).
130407 For God has not called us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.
130408 Therefore he who despises does not despise man, but God, who also has given us His Holy Spirit.
130409 But regarding brotherly love, you do not need that I write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.
130410 And indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we beseech you, brothers, that you abound more and more ,
130411 and that you try earnestly to be quiet and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,
130412 so that you may walk becomingly toward those outside, and that you may lack nothing.
130413 But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are asleep, that you be not grieved, even as others who have no hope.
130414 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will also bring with Him all those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.
130415 For we say this to you by the Word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not go before those who are asleep.
130416 For the Lord Himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ shall rise first.
130417 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. And so we shall ever be with the Lord.
130418 Therefore comfort one another with these words.
130501 But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.
130502 For you yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.
130503 For when they shall say, Peace and safety! Then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail upon a woman with child. And they shall not escape.
130504 But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that the Day should overtake you like a thief.
130505 You are all the sons of light and the sons of the day. We are not of the night, or of darkness.
130506 Therefore let us not sleep as the rest do , but let us watch and be calm.
130507 For those sleeping sleep in the night, and those being drunken are drunken in the night.
130508 But let us, who are of the day, be calm, having put on the breastplate of faith and love and the hope of salvation for a helmet.
130509 For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
130510 who died for us, so that whether we watch or sleep we should live together with Him.
130511 Therefore comfort one another, and edify one another, even as you also do.
130512 And, brothers, we beseech you to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and who admonish you,
130513 and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
130514 Now we exhort you, brothers, warn those who are unruly, comfort the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.
130515 See that none gives evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue the good, both towards one another and towards all.
130516 Rejoice evermore.
130517 Pray without ceasing.
130518 In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
130519 Do not quench the Spirit.
130520 Do not despise prophesying.
130521 Prove all things, hold fast to the good.
130522 Abstain from every appearance of evil.
130523 And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blamelessly at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
130524 Faithful is He who called you, who also will do it .
130525 Brothers, pray for us.
130526 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
130527 I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.
130528 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
140101 Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
140102 Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
140103 We are bound to thank God always for you, my brothers, as it is right, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of you abounds toward one another;
140104 so much so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations which you endure.
140105 For this is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you also suffer,
140106 since it is a righteous thing with God to repay tribulation to those who trouble you,
140107 and to give rest with us to you who are troubled, at the revealing of the Lord Jesus from Heaven with the angels of His power,
140108 in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,
140109 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,
140110 when He shall come to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all those who believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that Day.
140111 Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of the calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power,
140112 that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
140201 Now we beseech you, my brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,
140202 that you should not be soon shaken in mind or troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word or letter, as through us, as if the Day of Christ is at hand.
140203 Let not anyone deceive you by any means. For that Day shall not come unless there first comes a falling away, and the man of sin shall be revealed, the son of perdition,
140204 who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself forth, that he is God.
140205 Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you?
140206 And now you know what holds back, for him to be revealed in his own time.
140207 For the mystery of lawlessness is already working, only he is now holding back until it comes out of the midst.
140208 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the breath of His mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming,
140209 whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
140210 and with all deceit of unrighteousness in those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, so that they might be saved.
140211 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie,
140212 so that all those who do not believe the truth, but delight in unrighteousness, might be condemned.
140213 But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth,
140214 to which He called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
140215 Therefore, my brothers, stand fast and hold the teachings which you have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.
140216 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even our Father, who has loved us and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
140217 comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.
140301 Finally, my brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified, even as it also is with you.
140302 And pray that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all do not have the faith.
140303 But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you and guard you from the evil.
140304 And we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you.
140305 And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
140306 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly, and not after the teaching which he received from us.
140307 For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us. For we did not behave ourselves disorderly among you,
140308 neither did we eat any man's bread freely, but we worked with labor and travail night and day, so that we might not be heavy on any of you
140309 (not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example to you, to imitate us).
140310 For even when we were with you, we commanded you this, that if anyone would not work, neither should he eat.
140311 For we hear that there are some who walk disorderly among you, not working at all, but being busybodies.
140312 Now we command and exhort those who are such, by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness and eat their own bread.
140313 But you, brothers, do not be weary in well doing.
140314 And if anyone does not obey our word by this letter, mark that one and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
140315 Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
140316 And may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all.
140317 The greeting of Paul by my own hand which is the sign in every letter, so I write.
140318 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
150101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the command of God our Savior, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,
150102 to Timothy, my own son in the faith. Grace, mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
150103 Even as I begged you to remain at Ephesus, when I was going to Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
150104 nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies (which provide doubts rather than the nurture of God in faith).
150105 But the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned,
150106 from which some, having swerved, have turned aside to foolish talking,
150107 desiring to be teachers of the law, neither understanding what they say nor that which they affirm.
150108 But we know that the law is good if a man uses it lawfully,
150109 knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous one, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
150110 for fornicators, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and anything else that is contrary to sound doctrine,
150111 according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
150112 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who strengthened me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry--
150113 the one who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and insolent. But I obtained mercy, because being ignorant, I did it in unbelief.
150114 And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
150115 Faithful is the Word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.
150116 But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, as a pattern to those being about to believe on Him to life everlasting.
150117 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
150118 This charge I commit to you, my son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before about you, in order that you might war a good warfare by them,
150119 holding faith and a good conscience, which some have put away and made shipwreck as to faith.
150120 Among these are Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.
150201 First of all, then, I exhort that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,
150202 for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence.
150203 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
150204 who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
150205 For God is one, and there is one Mediator of God and of man, the Man Christ Jesus,
150206 who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
150207 To this I am ordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie), a teacher of the nations, in faith and truth.
150208 Therefore, I desire that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
150209 In the same way also, I desire that women adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and sensibleness, not adorned with braiding, or gold, or pearls, or costly clothing,
150210 but with good works, which becomes women professing godliness.
150211 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
150212 But I do not allow a woman to teach, or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence.
150213 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
150214 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
150215 But she will be kept safe through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sensibleness.
150301 Faithful is the word: If anyone reaches out to overseership, he desires a good work.
150302 Then it behooves the overseer to be without reproach, husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, well-ordered, hospitable, apt at teaching,
150303 not a drunkard, not contentious, not greedy of ill gain, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous,
150304 ruling his own house well, having children in subjection with all honor.
150305 (For if a man does not know to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
150306 not a novice, lest being puffed up he may fall into the condemnation of the Devil.
150307 But he must also have a good report from those on the outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.
150308 Likewise the deacons are to be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of ill gain,
150309 having the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
150310 And let these also first be tested, then let them minister without reproach.
150311 Even so their wives are to be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
150312 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and households well.
150313 For they having served well gain a good grade for themselves, and much boldness in the faith, those in Christ Jesus.
150314 I write these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly.
150315 But if I should delay, that you may know how you ought to behave in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
150316 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among nations, believed on in the world, and received up into glory.
150401 But the Spirit expressly says that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,
150402 speaking lies in hypocrisy, being seared in their own conscience,
150403 forbidding to marry, saying to abstain from foods which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
150404 For every creation of God is good, and nothing to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving.
150405 For it is sanctified through the Word of God and prayer.
150406 Having suggested these things to the brothers, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and by the good doctrine which you have followed.
150407 But refuse profane and old-womanish tales, and exercise yourself to godliness.
150408 For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the present life, and of that which is to come.
150409 Faithful is the Word, and worthy of all acceptance.
150410 For to this we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the preserver of all men, especially of those who believe.
150411 Command and teach these things.
150412 Let no one despise your youth, but be an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
150413 Until I come, attend to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
150414 Do not neglect the gift in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the body of elders.
150415 Meditate on these things; be in these things in order that your improvement may appear to all.
150416 Hold on to yourself and to the doctrine; continue in them, for doing this you shall both save yourself and those who hear you.
150501 Do not sharply rebuke an elder, but exhort as a father, and the younger ones as brothers,
150502 older women as mothers, the younger as sisters in all purity.
150503 Honor widows who are widows indeed.
150504 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to be godly to their own house, and give back to their forebears what is due them; for that is good and pleasing before God.
150505 But she being really a widow, and having been left alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.
150506 But she who lives in self-pleasure has died while living.
150507 And command these things so that they may be blameless.
150508 But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially his family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.
150509 Do not let a widow be enrolled having become less than sixty years old, the wife of one man,
150510 well reported of for good works: if she brought up children, if she lodged strangers, if she washed the feet of saints, if she relieved the afflicted, if she followed after every good work.
150511 But refuse younger widows, for whenever they grow lustful against Christ, they desire to marry;
150512 having guilt because they have cast off the first faith.
150513 And with it all they also learn to be idle, going around the houses; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things they ought not.
150514 Therefore I want the younger ones to marry, bear children, guide the house, giving no occasion to the adversary because of reproach.
150515 For some have already turned aside after Satan.
150516 If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be charged, so that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.
150517 Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and doctrine.
150518 For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox treading out grain," and, "The laborer is worthy of his reward."
150519 Do not receive an accusation against an elder except before two or three witnesses.
150520 Those who sin, rebuke before all, so that the rest also may fear.
150521 I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
150522 Do not lay hands quickly on anyone, neither be partaker of the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
150523 Drink water no longer, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and for your frequent infirmities.
150524 Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment. And some they also follow after.
150525 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand, and those who are otherwise cannot be hidden.
150601 Let as many slaves as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name and doctrine of God may not be blasphemed.
150602 And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brothers. But rather let them serve, because they are faithful and beloved, those of the good service receiving in return. Teach and exhort these things.
150603 If anyone teaches otherwise, and does not consent to wholesome words (those of our Lord Jesus Christ), and to the doctrine according to godliness,
150604 he is proud, knowing nothing. He is sick concerning doubts and arguments, from which comes envy, strife, evil speakings, evil suspicions,
150605 meddling, of men whose minds have been corrupted and deprived of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness. Withdraw from such.
150606 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
150607 For we brought nothing into the world, and it is clear that we can carry nothing out.
150608 But having food and clothing, we will be content.
150609 But they who will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which plunge men into destruction and perdition.
150610 For the love of money is a root of all evils, of which some having lusted after, they were seduced from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
150611 But you, O man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness.
150612 Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, to which you are also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.
150613 I charge you before God (who makes all things alive) and in the sight of Christ Jesus (who witnessed the good confession to Pontius Pilate),
150614 that you keep the commandment without spot and without blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
150615 For He in His own time will reveal who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
150616 who alone has immortality, dwelling in light which cannot be approached, whom no one of men have seen, nor can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.
150617 Charge the rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, He offering to us richly all things to enjoy,
150618 that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to share, to be generous,
150619 laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
150620 O Timothy, guard the Deposit, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of falsely-named science,
150621 which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
160101 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
160102 to Timothy, my dearly beloved child. Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
160103 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day,
160104 greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, so that I may be filled with joy,
160105 taking recollection of the unfeigned faith that is in you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice. And I am persuaded that it is in you also.
160106 Therefore I remind you to inflame anew the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands.
160107 For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.
160108 Therefore you should not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner. But be partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God,
160109 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the eternal times.
160110 But it is now having been manifested by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has made death of no effect, bringing life and immortality to light through the gospel;
160111 to which I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the nations.
160112 For this cause I also suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard My deposit unto that Day.
160113 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
160114 Guard the good Deposit given through the Holy Spirit indwelling in us.
160115 This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
160116 May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain.
160117 But when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me .
160118 May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day. And in what things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.
160201 Therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
160202 And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
160203 Therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
160204 No one who wars tangles with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who chose him to be a soldier.
160205 And also if anyone competes, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully.
160206 It is right for the laboring farmer to partake first of the fruits.
160207 Consider what I say, and the Lord will give you understanding in all things.
160208 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel,
160209 in which I suffer ill as an evildoer, even to bonds. But the Word of God is not chained.
160210 Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
160211 For faithful is the Word, for if we died with Him , we shall also live with Him.
160212 If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him . If we deny Him , He also will deny us.
160213 If we do not believe Him , yet He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.
160214 Put them in memory of these things, charging them before the Lord not to dispute about words to no profit, to the subverting of the hearers.
160215 Study earnestly to present yourself approved to God, a workman that does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.
160216 But shun profane, vain babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness.
160217 And their word will eat like a gangrene; among whom are Hymeneus and Philetus,
160218 who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and who overthrow the faith of some.
160219 Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal: " The Lord knew those who are His." And, "Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity!"
160220 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.
160221 Therefore if anyone purges himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified and useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.
160222 But flee youthful lusts, and follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
160223 But avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they give birth to strifes.
160224 But the servant of the Lord must not strive, but to be gentle to all, apt to teach, patient,
160225 in meekness instructing those who oppose, if perhaps God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth,
160226 and that they awake out of the snare of the Devil, having been taken captive by him, so as to do the will of that one.
160301 Know this also, that in the last days grievous times will be at hand.
160302 For men will be self-lovers, money-lovers, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
160303 without natural affection, unyielding, false accusers, without self-control, savage, despisers of good,
160304 traitors, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
160305 having a form of godliness, but denying the power of it; even turn away from these.
160306 For of these are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women loaded with sins, led away with different kinds of lusts,
160307 ever learning and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth.
160308 But as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so these also resist the truth, men of corrupt mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
160309 But they shall proceed no further. For their foolishness shall be plain to all, as theirs also became.
160310 But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience,
160311 persecutions, afflictions, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra. What persecutions I endured! But the Lord delivered me out of all.
160312 Yea, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
160313 But evil men and seducers will go forward to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
160314 But continue in the things that you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them ,
160315 and that from a babe you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
160316 All Scripture is God-breathed, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
160317 that the man of God may be perfected, thoroughly furnished to every good work.
160401 Therefore I solemnly witness before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is going to judge the living and the dead according to His appearance and His kingdom,
160402 preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.
160403 For a time will be when they will not endure sound doctrine, but they will heap up teachers to themselves according to their own lusts, tickling the ear.
160404 And they will turn away their ears from the truth and will be turned to myths.
160405 But you watch in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fully carry out your ministry.
160406 For I am already being poured out, and the time of my release is here.
160407 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.
160408 Now there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that Day; and not to me only, but also to all those who love His appearing.
160409 Make haste to come to me quickly.
160410 For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and he has departed to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
160411 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
160412 And I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
160413 When you come, bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.
160414 Alexander the coppersmith showed many evil things to me. The Lord will give back to him according to his works.
160415 You also should beware of him , for he has greatly withstood our words.
160416 At my first answer no one was beside me, but all deserted me. May it not be laid to their charge.
160417 But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, that through me the preaching might be fulfilled, and that all the nations might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
160418 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me to His heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
160419 Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.
160420 Erastus stayed at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.
160421 Try to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.
160422 May the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
170101 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ (according to the faith of God's elect, in the acknowledging of the truth which is according to godliness
170102 on hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the eternal times,
170103 but revealed His word in its own times in a proclamation, with which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior,)
170104 to Titus, a true child according to our common faith. Grace mercy and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
170105 For this cause I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you,
170106 if anyone is blameless, husband of one wife, having believing children, not accused of loose behavior, or disobedient.
170107 For an overseer must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not full of passion, not given to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy for ill gain;
170108 but hospitable, a lover of good, discreet, just, holy, temperate,
170109 holding fast the faithful word according to the doctrine, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and to convict the gainsayers.
170110 For there are indeed many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
170111 whose mouth you must stop, who subvert whole houses, teaching things not right for the sake of ill gain.
170112 One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.
170113 This witness is true; for which cause convict them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,
170114 not giving heed to Jewish myths and commandments of men, turning away from the truth.
170115 To the pure all things are pure. But to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
170116 They profess that they know God, but in their works they deny Him , being abominable and disobedient and reprobate to every good work.
170201 But you speak the things which become sound doctrine:
170202 aged men to be temperate, sensible, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience.
170203 Let the aged women likewise be in reverent behavior, not slanderers, not enslaved by much wine, teachers of good;
170204 that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
170205 to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, that the Word of God may not be blasphemed.
170206 Likewise exhort the young men to be discreet;
170207 In all things having shown yourself a pattern of good works: in the doctrine, purity, sensibleness, without corruption,
170208 in sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he who is opposed may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
170209 Slaves are to be obedient to their masters, to please them well in all things , not talking against,
170210 not stealing, but showing all good faith, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
170211 For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,
170212 teaching us that having denied ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live discreetly, righteously and godly, in this present world,
170213 looking for the blessed hope, and the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
170214 who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity and purify to Himself a special people, zealous of good works.
170215 Speak these things, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.
170301 Put them in mind to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to every good work,
170302 to speak evil of no one, not being quarrelsome, but forbearing, showing all meekness to all men.
170303 For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, slaving for various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
170304 But when the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,
170305 not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,
170306 whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
170307 that being justified by His grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
170308 Faithful is the Word, and as to these things, I desire that you strongly affirm that those believing God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.
170309 But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions, and strivings about the Law, for they are unprofitable and vain.
170310 After the first and second warning, reject a man of heresy,
170311 knowing that he who is such has been perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
170312 When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.
170313 Diligently set forward Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, that nothing may be lacking to them.
170314 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, so that they may not be unfruitful.
170315 All those with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. May grace be with you all. Amen.
180101 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon the beloved and fellow laborer,
180102 and to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.
180103 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
180104 I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,
180105 hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
180106 that the fellowship of your faith may operate in a full knowledge of every good thing in you in Christ Jesus.
180107 For we have great joy and consolation over your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.
180108 Therefore, having much boldness in Christ to enjoin you to do the fitting thing;
180109 rather through love I entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
180110 I entreat you for my child Onesimus, whom I have fathered in my bonds,
180111 he who was once worthless to you, but now useful to you and to me; whom I sent back to you.
180112 Even receive him, that is, my own heart,
180113 whom I resolved to retain with myself, so that for you he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel.
180114 But without your consent I was willing to do nothing, that your good should not be of necessity, but willingly.
180115 For perhaps because of this he was separated from you for an hour, that you should receive him eternally,
180116 not now as a slave, but beyond a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
180117 If then you have me as a partner, receive him as me.
180118 If he has wronged you or owes you in anything, put that on my account.
180119 I, Paul, wrote it with my own hand; I will repay, that I do not say to you that you owe even yourself to me also.
180120 Yes, brother, that I may have your help in the Lord, refresh my heart in the Lord.
180121 Trusting to your obedience, I wrote to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.
180122 But at once prepare lodging for me, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you.
180123 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
180124 and also Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-laborers.
180125 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
190101 God, who at many times and in many ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,
190102 has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds,
190103 who being the shining splendor of His glory, and the express image of His essence, and upholding all things by the word of His power, through Himself cleansing of our sins, He sat down on the right of the Majesty on high,
190104 being made so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
190105 For to which of the angels did He say at any time, "You are My Son, this day I have begotten You?" And again, "I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son?"
190106 And again, when He brings in the First-born into the world, He says, "And let all the angels of God worship Him."
190107 And of the angels He says, "Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire."
190108 But to the Son He says , "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom.
190109 You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows."
190110 And, "You, Lord, have laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.
190111 They shall perish, but You will remain. And they shall all become old as a garment,
190112 and as a covering You shall fold them up, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail."
190113 But to which of the angels, did He say at any time, "Sit on My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool?"
190114 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation?
190201 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.
190202 For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and if every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward,
190203 how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by those who heard Him ;
190204 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with different kinds of miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?
190205 For He has not put in subjection to the angels the world to come, of which we speak.
190206 But one testified in a certain place, saying, "What is man, that You are mindful of him; or the son of man, that You visit him?
190207 You have made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of Your hands.
190208 You subjected all things under his feet." For in subjecting all things to Him, He did not leave anything not subjected to Him. But now we do not see all things having been subjected to him.
190209 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that He by the grace of God should taste death for every son .
190210 For it became Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons into glory, to perfect the Captain of their salvation through sufferings.
190211 For both He who sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers,
190212 saying, "I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You."
190213 And again, "I will put My trust in Him." And again, "Behold Me and the children whom God has given Me."
190214 Since then the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise partook of the same; that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death (that is, the Devil),
190215 and deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
190216 For truly He did not take the nature of angels, but He took hold of the seed of Abraham.
190217 Therefore in all things it behoved him to be made like His brothers, that He might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of His people.
190218 For in that He Himself has suffered, having been tempted, He is able to rescue those who are being tempted.
190301 Therefore, holy brothers, called to be partakers of the heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,
190302 who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all his house.
190303 For He was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who has built the house has more honor than the house.
190304 For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.
190305 And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken afterward.
190306 But Christ was faithful as a Son over his own house; whose house we are, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.
190307 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today if you will hear His voice,
190308 do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
190309 when your fathers tempted Me, proved Me, and saw My works forty years.
190310 Therefore I was grieved with that generation and said, They always err in their heart, and they have not known My ways.
190311 So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest."
190312 Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
190313 But exhort one another daily, while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
190314 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end,
190315 while it is said, "Today if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
190316 For some, when they had heard, did provoke; however, not all who came out of Egypt by Moses.
190317 But with whom was He grieved forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
190318 And to whom did He swear that they should not enter into His rest, but to those who did not believe?
190319 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
190401 Therefore, a promise being left to enter into His rest, let us fear lest any of you should seem to come short of it.
190402 For also we have had the gospel preached, as well as them. But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it .
190403 For we who have believed do enter into the rest, as He said, "I have sworn in My wrath that they should not enter into My rest;" although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
190404 For He spoke in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: "And God rested the seventh day from all His works."
190405 And in this place again, "They shall not enter into My rest."
190406 Since then it remains that some must enter into it, and since they to whom it was first preached did not enter in because of unbelief,
190407 He again marks out a certain day, saying in David, "Today," (after so long a time). Even as it is said, "Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts."
190408 For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.
190409 So then there remains a rest to the people of God.
190410 For he who has entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from His.
190411 Therefore let us labor to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of unbelief.
190412 For the word of God is living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
190413 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight, but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
190414 Since then we have a great High Priest who has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
190415 For we do not have a high priest who cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted just as we are, yet without sin.
190416 Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
190501 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things pertaining to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,
190502 who can have compassion on the ignorant and on those who are out of the way. For he himself also is compassed with weakness.
190503 And because of this he should, as for the people, so also for himself, offer for sins.
190504 And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called of God, as Aaron was .
190505 So also Christ did not glorify Himself to be made a high priest, but He who said to Him, "You are My Son, today I have begotten You."
190506 As He says also in another place , "You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."
190507 For Jesus , in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications with strong cryings and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard in that He feared,
190508 though being a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.
190509 And being perfected, He became the Author of eternal salvation to all those who obey Him,
190510 being called by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek;
190511 of whom we have much to say, and hard to be explained since you are dull of hearing.
190512 For indeed because of the time, you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again what are the first principles of the oracles of God. And you have become in need of milk, and not of solid food.
190513 For everyone partaking of milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.
190514 But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, even those who because of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
190601 Therefore, having left the discourse of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to full growth, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
190602 of the baptisms, of doctrine, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
190603 And this we will do, if God permits.
190604 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
190605 and have tasted the good Word of God and the powers of the world to come,
190606 and who have fallen away; it is impossible, I say, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify the Son of God afresh to themselves and put Him to an open shame.
190607 (For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth plants fit for those by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God.
190608 But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected and is a curse, whose end is to be burned.)
190609 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation, though we speak in this way.
190610 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
190611 And we desire that each one of you show the same eagerness to the full assurance of hope to the end,
190612 that you be not slothful, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
190613 For when God made promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He swore by Himself,
190614 saying, "Surely in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply you."
190615 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
190616 For men truly swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
190617 In this way desiring to declare more fully to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, God interposed by an oath,
190618 so that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us ,
190619 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil,
190620 where the Forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
190701 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.
190702 To him Abraham also gave a tenth of all. He was first by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace,
190703 without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually.
190704 Now consider how great this man was , to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
190705 And truly they who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priest, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the Law, that is, from their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham.
190706 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
190707 And without all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better.
190708 And here men who die receive tithes; but there he receives them , of whom it is witnessed that he lives.
190709 And if I may say so, Levi, also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.
190710 For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
190711 Therefore if perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
190712 For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made in the law also.
190713 For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man gave attendance at the altar.
190714 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
190715 And it is still far more evident, since there arises another priest after the likeness of Melchizedek,
190716 who is made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.
190717 For He testifies, "You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."
190718 For truly there is a putting away of the commandment which went before, because of the weakness and unprofitableness of it.
190719 For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did , by which we draw near to God.
190720 And inasmuch as He was not made priest without an oath
190721 (for those priests were made without an oath, but this one was made with an oath by Him who said to Him, "The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek,")
190722 by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better covenant.
190723 And they truly were many priests, because they were not allowed to continue because of death;
190724 but He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.
190725 Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost those who come unto God by Him, since He ever lives to make intercession for them.
190726 For such a high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens,
190727 who does not need, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice daily, first for his own sins and then for the people's sins. For He did this once for all, when He offered up Himself.
190728 For the Law appoints men high priests who have infirmity, but the word of the swearing of an oath, after the Law, has consecrated the Son forever, having been perfected.
190801 Now the sum of the things which we have spoken is this : We have such a High Priest, who has sat down on the right of the throne of the Majesty in Heaven,
190802 a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
190803 For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One have something to offer also.
190804 For if indeed He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the Law,
190805 who serve the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned of God when he was about to make the tabernacle. For, He says "See that you make all things according to the pattern shown to you in the mountain."
190806 But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which was built upon better promises.
190807 For if that first covenant had been without fault, then no place would have been sought for the second.
190808 For finding fault with them, He said to them, "Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, and I will make an end on the house of Israel and on the house of Judah; a new covenant shall be,
190809 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt," because they did not continue in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says the Lord.
190810 "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their mind and write them in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
190811 And they shall not each man teach his neighbor, and each man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know Me, from the least to the greatest.
190812 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more."
190813 In that He says, A new covenant , He has made the first one old. Now that which decays and becomes old is ready to vanish away.
190901 Then truly the first tabernacle had also ordinances of divine service and an earthly sanctuary.
190902 For the first tabernacle was prepared, in which was both the lampstand, and the table, and the setting out of the loaves, which is called Holies.
190903 And after the second veil was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
190904 having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all around with gold, in which was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.
190905 And over it were the cherubs of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat (about which we cannot now speak piece by piece.
190906 Now when these things were ordained in this way, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God .
190907 But once in the year into the second the high priest goes alone, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people)
190908 the Holy Spirit signifying by this that the way into the Holiest of all was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing.
190909 For it was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him who did the service perfect as regards the conscience,
190910 which stood only in meats and drinks, and different kinds of washings and fleshly ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
190911 But when Christ had become a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building
190912 nor by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered once for all into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption for us .
190913 For if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh,
190914 how much more shall the blood of Christ (who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God) purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
190915 And for this cause He is the Mediator of the new covenant, so that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, those who are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
190916 For where a covenant is , the death of him covenanting must be offered.
190917 For a covenant is affirmed over those dead, since it never has force when The one covenanting is living.
190918 From which we see that neither was the first covenant dedicated without blood.
190919 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
190920 saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you."
190921 And likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.
190922 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission.
190923 Therefore it was necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves were purified with better sacrifices than these.
190924 For Christ has not entered into the Holy of Holies made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.
190925 Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, even as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies every year with the blood of others
190926 (for then He must have suffered often since the foundation of the world), but now once in the end of the world He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.
190927 And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment,
190928 so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many. And to those who look for Him He shall appear the second time without sin to salvation.
191001 For the Law which has a shadow of good things to come, not the very image of the things, appearing year by year with the same sacrifices, which they offer continually, they are never able to perfect those drawing near.
191002 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshipers, when they had been once for all purged, would have had no more conscience of sin.
191003 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again of sins every year.
191004 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
191005 Therefore when He comes into the world, He says, "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but You have prepared a body for Me.
191006 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You have had no pleasure.
191007 Then I said, Lo, I come ( in the volume of the Book it is written of Me) to do Your will, O God."
191008 Above, when He said, "Sacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings and offering for sin You did not desire, neither did You have pleasure in them" (which are offered according to the Law),
191009 then He said, "Lo, I come to do Your will, O God." He takes away the first so that He may establish the second.
191010 By this will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
191011 And indeed every priest stands daily ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
191012 But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right of God,
191013 from then on expecting until His enemies are made His footstool.
191014 For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are sanctified.
191015 The Holy Spirit also is a witness to us; for after He had said before,
191016 "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,"
191017 also He adds, "their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more."
191018 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
191019 Therefore, brothers, having boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus,
191020 by a new and living way which He has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, His flesh;
191021 and having a High Priest over the house of God,
191022 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies having been washed with pure water.
191023 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering (for He is faithful who promised),
191024 and let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,
191025 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is , but exhorting one another , and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.
191026 For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,
191027 but a certain fearful looking for judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
191028 He who despised Moses' law died without mercy on the word of two or three witnesses.
191029 Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy of punishment, the one who has trampled the Son of God, and who has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
191030 For we know Him who has said, "Vengeance belongs to Me, I will repay, says the Lord." And again, "The Lord shall judge His people."
191031 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
191032 But call to memory the former days, in which (after you were illuminated) you endured a great fight of afflictions,
191033 indeed being exposed both by reproaches and afflictions, and while you became companions of those who lived so.
191034 For you both sympathized with my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in Heaven a better and an enduring substance.
191035 Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.
191036 For you have need of patience, so that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise.
191037 For "yet a little while, and He who shall come will come and will not delay."
191038 Now, "the Just shall live by faith. But if he draws back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him."
191039 But we are not of those withdrawing to destruction, but of those who believe to the preserving of the soul.
191101 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
191102 For by it the elders obtained a good report.
191103 By faith we understand that the ages were framed by a word of God, so that the things being seen not to have come into being out of the things that appear.
191104 By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts. And by it he, being dead, yet speaks.
191105 By faith Enoch was translated so as not to see death, and he was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
191106 But without faith it is impossible to please Him , for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.
191107 By faith Noah, having been warned by God of things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
191108 By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out into a place which he was afterward going to receive for an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he went.
191109 By faith he lived in the land of promise as a stranger, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs of the same promise with him.
191110 For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
191111 By faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged Him who had promised to be faithful.
191112 Because of this came into being from one, and that of one having died, even as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.
191113 These all died by way of faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off. And they were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
191114 For they who say such things declare plainly that they seek a fatherland.
191115 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from which they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
191116 But now they stretch forth to a better fatherland , that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.
191117 By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. And he who had received the promises offered up his only-begotten son ,
191118 of whom it was said that in Isaac your Seed shall be called,
191119 concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from where he even received him, in a figure.
191120 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
191121 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning upon the top of his staff.
191122 By faith, Joseph dying remembered concerning the Exodus of the sons of Israel and gave orders concerning his bones.
191123 By faith Moses, having been born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child. And they were not afraid of the king's commandments.
191124 Having become great, Moses by faith refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
191125 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time,
191126 esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.
191127 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.
191128 Through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest He who destroyed the first-born should touch them.
191129 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land , which the Egyptians attempting to do were drowned.
191130 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed seven days.
191131 By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.
191132 And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah; also David, and Samuel and the prophets,
191133 who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
191134 quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the strangers.
191135 Women received their dead raised to life again, and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
191136 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings; yes, more, of bonds and imprisonments.
191137 They were stoned, they were sawed in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented.
191138 The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth.
191139 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, did not receive the promise,
191140 for God had provided some better thing for us, that they should not be made perfect without us.
191201 Therefore since we also are surrounded with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily besets us , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
191202 looking to Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and sat down at the right of the throne of God.
191203 For consider Him who endured such contradiction of sinners against Himself, lest you be weary and faint in your minds.
191204 You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
191205 And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons, "My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked by Him;
191206 for whom the Lord loves He chastens, and He scourges every son whom He receives."
191207 If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons, for what son is he whom the father does not chasten?
191208 But if you are without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then you are bastards and not sons.
191209 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us , and we gave them reverence. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?
191210 For truly they chastened us for a few days according to their own pleasure, but He for our profit, that we might be partakers of His holiness.
191211 Now chastening for the present does not seem to be joyous, but grievous. Nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who are exercised by it.
191212 Because of this, straighten up the hands which hang down and the enfeebled knees.
191213 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed.
191214 Follow peace with all, and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord;
191215 looking diligently lest any fail of the grace of God, or lest any root of bitterness springing up disturb you , and by it many are defiled,
191216 (lest there be any fornicator, or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright.
191217 For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he did not find any place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears).
191218 For you have not come to the mountain that might be touched and that burned with fire, nor to blackness and darkness and tempest,
191219 and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words (which voice they who heard begged that a word should not be spoken to them any more,
191220 for they could not endure the thing commanded, "And if so much as a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart,"
191221 and so fearful was the sight that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake).
191222 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
191223 to the general assembly and church of the first-born who are written in Heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
191224 and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.
191225 See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape, those who refused him that spoke on earth, much more we shall not escape if we turn away from Him who speaks from Heaven,
191226 whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, "Yet once more I will not only shake the earth, but also the heavens."
191227 And this word , "Yet once more," signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, so that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.
191228 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear,
191229 for also, "Our God is a consuming fire."
191301 Let brotherly love continue.
191302 Do not be forgetful of hospitality, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.
191303 Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them , those who suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
191304 Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled, but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
191305 Let your way of life be without the love of money, and be content with such things as you have, for He has said, "Not at all will I leave you, not at all will I forsake you, never!"
191306 so that we may boldly say, " The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me."
191307 Remember those leading you, who have spoken to you the Word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conduct:
191308 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever.
191309 Do not be carried about with different and strange doctrines, for it is good for the heart to be established with grace, not with foods, in which those who have walked in them were not helped.
191310 We have an altar of which they have no right to eat, those who serve the tabernacle.
191311 For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the Holy of Holies by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp.
191312 Therefore Jesus also, so that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.
191313 Therefore let us go forth to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
191314 For here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
191315 By Him, then, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, confessing His name.
191316 But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
191317 Yield to those leading you, and be submissive, for they watch for your souls, as those who must give account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you.
191318 Pray for us; for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
191319 But I beseech you the rather to do this, so that I may be more quickly restored to you.
191320 Now may the God of peace (who brought again our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant)
191321 make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
191322 And I beseech you, brothers, allow the word of exhortation. For I have written a letter to you in few words.
191323 Know that our brother Timothy has been set at liberty, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.
191324 Greet all those leading you, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.
191325 Grace be with you all. Amen.
200101 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion, greeting:
200102 My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into different kinds of temptations,
200103 knowing that the trying of your faith works patience.
200104 But let patience have its perfect work, so that you may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing.
200105 But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and with no reproach, and it shall be given to him.
200106 But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing. For he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.
200107 For do not let that man think that he shall receive anything from the Lord;
200108 he is a double-minded man, not dependable in all his ways.
200109 But let the humble brother rejoice in his exaltation;
200110 and the rich one rejoice in his humiliation, because he shall pass away as the flower of the grass.
200111 For the sun rose with the hot wind and dried up the grass, and its flower fell out, and the beauty of its appearance perished; so also the rich one will fade away in his ways.
200112 Blessed is the man who endures temptation, because having been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
200113 Let no one being tempted say, I am tempted from God. For God is not tempted by evils, and He tempts no one.
200114 But each one is tempted by his lusts, being drawn away and seduced by them .
200115 Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin. And sin, when it is fully formed, brings forth death.
200116 Do not err, my beloved brothers.
200117 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning.
200118 Of His own will He brought us forth with the Word of truth, for us to be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.
200119 Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.
200120 For the wrath of man does not work out the righteousness of God.
200121 Therefore putting aside all filthiness and overflowing of evil, receive in meekness the implanted Word, which is able to save your souls.
200122 But become doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
200123 For if anyone is a hearer of the Word and not a doer, he is like a man studying his natural face in a mirror.
200124 For he studied himself and went his way, and immediately he forgot what he was like.
200125 But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it , he is not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work. This one shall be blessed in his doing.
200126 If anyone thinks to be religious among you, yet does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this one's religion is vain.
200127 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit orphans and widows in their afflictions, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.
200201 My brothers, do not have the faith of our Lord Christ, the Lord of glory, with respecter of faces.
200202 For if there comes a gold-fingered man in fancy clothing into your assembly, and if there also comes in a poor man in shabby clothing,
200203 and if you have respect to him who has the fancy clothing and say to him, You sit here in a good place, and say to the poor, You stand there, or sit here under my footstool;
200204 Did you not make a difference among yourselves and became judges with evil thoughts?
200205 Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He has promised to those who love Him?
200206 But you dishonored the poor one. Do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats?
200207 Do they not blaspheme that worthy Name by which you are called?
200208 If you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well.
200209 But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
200210 For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point , he is guilty of all.
200211 For He who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." But if you do not commit adultery, yet if you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
200212 So speak and do as those who shall be judged by the law of liberty.
200213 For he who has shown no mercy shall have judgment without mercy, and mercy exults over judgment.
200214 My brothers, what profit is it if a man says he has faith and does not have works? Can faith save him?
200215 If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,
200216 and if one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, but you do not give them those things which are needful to the body, what good is it ?
200217 Even so, if it does not have works, faith is dead, being by itself.
200218 But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith from my works.
200219 You believe that there is one God, you do well; even the demons believe and tremble.
200220 But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
200221 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
200222 Do you see how faith worked with his works, and from the works faith was made complete?
200223 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness, and he was called the friend of God."
200224 You see then how a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.
200225 And in the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way?
200226 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
200301 My brothers, do not be many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
200302 For in many things we all offend. If anyone does not offend in word, the same is a full-grown man, able also to bridle the whole body.
200303 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, so that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.
200304 Behold also the ships being so great, and driven by fierce winds, yet they are turned about with a very small rudder, where the impulse of him steering desires.
200305 Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. Behold how little a fire kindles how large a forest!
200306 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. So the tongue is set among our members, spotting all the body and inflaming the course of nature, and being inflamed by hell.
200307 For every kind of animals, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of sea-animals, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.
200308 But no one can tame the tongue, it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
200309 By this we bless God, even the Father. And by this we curse men, who have come into being according to the image of God.
200310 Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
200311 Does a fountain send forth at the same hole the sweet and the bitter?
200312 Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries; or a vine, figs? So no fountain can yield both salt water and fresh.
200313 Who is wise and knowing among you? Let him show his works by his good conduct with meekness of wisdom.
200314 But if you have bitter jealousy and strife in your hearts, do not glory and lie against the truth.
200315 This is not the wisdom coming down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
200316 For where envying and strife are , there is confusion and every foul deed.
200317 But the wisdom that is from above is first truly pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.
200318 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
200401 From where do wars and fightings among you come ? Is it not from this, from your lusts which war in your members?
200402 You desire, and do not have. You murder, and are jealous, and cannot obtain. You fight and war, yet you have not because you ask not.
200403 You ask and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it upon your lusts.
200404 Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever desires to be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
200405 Do you think that the Scripture says in vain, The spirit that dwells in us yearns to envy?
200406 But He gives more grace. Therefore He says, God resists the proud, but He gives grace to the humble.
200407 Therefore submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
200408 Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners; and purify your hearts, double-minded ones.
200409 Be afflicted, and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness.
200410 Be humbled before the Lord, and He will lift you up.
200411 Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against his brother, and who judges his brother, speaks against the Law and judges the Law. But if you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but a judge.
200412 There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you who judges another?
200413 Come now, those saying, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and spend a year there, and we will trade and will make a profit,
200414 who do not know of the morrow. For what is your life? For it is a vapor, which appears for a little time, and then disappears.
200415 Instead of you saying, If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.
200416 But now you boast in your presumptions. All such boasting is evil.
200417 Therefore to him who knows to do good, and does not do it , to him it is sin.
200501 Come now, rich ones, weep and howl for your hardships coming on.
200502 Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.
200503 Your gold and silver have corroded, and their poison will be a witness against you, and will eat your flesh as fire. You heaped treasure in the last days.
200504 Behold, the hire of the laborers reaping your fields cry out, being kept back by you. And the cries of those who have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.
200505 You have lived luxuriously on the earth, and lived wantonly. You have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
200506 You have condemned and murdered the just; he does not resist you.
200507 Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth and has long patience for it, until he receives the early and the latter rain.
200508 You also be patient, establish your hearts, for the coming of your Lord draws near.
200509 Do not grudge against one another, brothers, lest you be condemned. Behold, the Judge stands before the door.
200510 My brothers, take the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering ill, and of patience.
200511 Behold, we count blessed those who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is full of pity and of tender mercy.
200512 But before all things, my brothers, do not swear; neither by the heaven nor by the earth, nor any other oath. But let your yes be yes, and your no, no, lest you fall into condemnation.
200513 Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing psalms.
200514 Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
200515 And the prayer of faith will cure the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up. And if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.
200516 Confess faults to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous one avails much.
200517 Elijah was a man of like passion as we are. And he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for the time of three years and six months.
200518 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to sprout.
200519 Brothers, if anyone among you err from the truth, and if anyone turns him back,
200520 know that he who turns back the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
210101 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect sojourners of the Dispersion of Pontus, of Galatia, of Cappadocia, of Asia, and of Bithynia,
210102 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
210103 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
210104 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in Heaven for you
210105 by the power of God, having been kept through faith to a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time;
210106 in which you greatly rejoice, yet a little while , if need be, grieving in manifold temptations;
210107 so that the trial of your faith (being much more precious than that of gold that perishes, but being proven through fire) might be found to praise and honor and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ,
210108 whom having not seen, you love; in whom not yet seeing, but believing in Him you exult with unspeakable joy, and having been glorified,
210109 obtaining the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
210110 About which salvation the prophets sought out and searched out, prophesying concerning the grace for you;
210111 searching for what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ made clear within them, testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow.
210112 To them it was revealed that not to themselves, but to us, they ministered the things which are now reported to you by those who have preached the gospel to you in the Holy Spirit sent from Heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
210113 Therefore girding up the loins of your mind, being sober, perfectly hope for the grace being brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ,
210114 as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance,
210115 but according to the Holy One who has called you, you also become holy in all conduct,
210116 because it is written, "Be holy, for I am holy."
210117 And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to the work of each one, pass the time of your earthly residence in fear,
210118 knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers,
210119 but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot;
210120 indeed having been foreknown before the foundation of the world, but revealed in the last times for you,
210121 those believing in God through Him, He who raised Him up from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.
210122 Purifying your souls in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, love one another fervently out of a pure heart,
210123 having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living word of God, and abiding forever.
210124 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of men as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls out,
210125 but the Word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the Word preached as gospel to you.
210201 Therefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings, and all evil speakings,
210202 desire the sincere milk of the word, as newborn babes, so that you may grow by it;
210203 if truly you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
210204 For having been drawn to Him, a living Stone, indeed rejected by men, but elect, precious with God;
210205 you also as living stones are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
210206 Therefore also it is contained in the Scripture: "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner Stone, elect, precious, and he who believes on Him shall never be ashamed."
210207 Therefore to you who believe is the honor. But to those who are disobedient, He is the Stone which the builders rejected; this One came to be the Head of the corner,
210208 and a Stone-of-stumbling and a Rock-of-offense to those disobeying, who stumble at the word, to which they also were appointed.
210209 But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for possession, so that you might speak of the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
210210 you who then were not a people, but now the people of God, those not pitied then , but now pitied.
210211 Dearly beloved, I exhort you as temporary residents and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,
210212 having your conduct honest among the nations, in that which they speak against you as evildoers, they may glorify God in a day of His visitation, seeing your good works.
210213 Then be in obedience to every ordinance of men, because of the Lord, whether to a king as supreme,
210214 or to governors as sent by Him for vengeance on evildoers, but for praise on well-doers.
210215 For such is the will of God, doing good to silence the ignorance of foolish men;
210216 as free, and not having freedom as a cover of evil, but as servants of God.
210217 Honor all. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
210218 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to those good and forbearing, but also to the perverse ones.
210219 For this is a grace, if for conscience toward God anyone endures grief, suffering wrongfully.
210220 For what glory is it if you patiently endure while sinning and being buffeted? But if you suffer while doing good, and patiently endure, this is a grace from God.
210221 For you were not called to this? For Christ also suffered on our behalf, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps,
210222 He who did no sin, nor was guile found in His mouth,
210223 who when He was reviled did not revile in return. When He suffered, He did not threaten, but gave Himself up to Him who judges righteously.
210224 He Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that dying to sins, we might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.
210225 For you were as sheep going astray, but now you are turned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
210301 Likewise, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, so that if any do not obey the word, they may also be won without the word by the conduct of the wives,
210302 having witnessed your chaste behavior in the fear of God .
210303 Of whom let not be the adorning of garments, or outward braiding of hair and wearing of gold, or of putting on clothing,
210304 but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, the meek and quiet spirit, which is of great price in the sight of God.
210305 For so once indeed the holy women hoping in God adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands;
210306 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children you became, doing good and fearing no terror.
210307 Likewise, husbands, live together according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife as to the weaker vessel, the female, as truly being co-heirs together of the grace of life, not cutting off your prayers.
210308 And finally, all be of one mind, having compassion on one another, loving the brothers, tenderhearted, friendly.
210309 Never give back evil for evil, or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, giving blessing, knowing that you are called to this so that you might inherit blessing.
210310 For he that wants to love life and to see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile.
210311 Let him turn aside from evil and do good. Let him seek peace and pursue it.
210312 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears open to their prayers. But the Lord's face is against those who do evil.
210313 And who is the one who will harm you if you become imitators of the good?
210314 But if you also suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. And do not fear their fear, nor be troubled,
210315 but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason of the hope in you, with meekness and fear;
210316 having a good conscience, that while they speak against you as evildoers they may be shamed, those falsely accusing your good behavior in Christ.
210317 For it is better, if the will of God wills it , to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.
210318 For Christ also once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, indeed being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit;
210319 in which also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,
210320 to disobeying ones, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared (in which a few, that is, eight souls were saved through water);
210321 which figure now also saves us, baptism; not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
210322 who is at the right hand of God, having gone into Heaven, where the angels and authorities and powers are being subjected to Him.
210401 Therefore, Christ having suffered for us in the flesh, also you arm yourselves with the same thought, that he suffering in the flesh has been made to rest from sin,
210402 in order no longer to live in the lusts of men, but in the will of God the remaining time in the flesh.
210403 For the time of life which is past is enough for us to have worked out the will of the nations, having gone on in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, parties, carousings, and abominable idolatries.
210404 In these things they are surprised, that you are not running with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming.
210405 But they shall give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
210406 For to this end the gospel was preached also to the dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit.
210407 But the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore be of sound mind, and be sensible to prayers.
210408 And above all things have fervent love to yourselves, for love will cover a multitude of sins.
210409 Be hospitable to one another, without grudging;
210410 each one as he received a gift, ministering it to yourselves as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
210411 If anyone speaks, let it be as the words of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as of the ability which God gives, so that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory, and the might forever and ever. Amen.
210412 Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which is to try you, as though a strange thing happened to you,
210413 but rejoice according as you are partakers of Christ's suffering, so that when His glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.
210414 If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of God and of glory rests on you. Truly according to them, He is blasphemed, but according to you He is glorified.
210415 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or a meddler in the affairs of others.
210416 But if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God because of this.
210417 For the time has come for the judgment to begin from the house of God. And if it first begins from us, what will be the end of those disobeying the gospel of God?
210418 And if the righteous one is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
210419 Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator.
210501 I exhort the elders who are among you, I being also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.
210502 Feed the flock of God among you, taking the oversight, not by compulsion, but willingly; nor for base gain, but readily;
210503 nor as lording it over those allotted to you by God , but becoming examples to the flock.
210504 And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a never-fading crown of glory.
210505 Likewise, younger ones, be subject to older ones, and all being subject to one another. Put on humility. For God resists proud ones, but He gives grace to the humble.
210506 Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you in due time,
210507 casting all your anxiety onto Him, for He cares for you.
210508 Be sensible and vigilant, because your adversary the Devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking someone he may devour;
210509 whom firmly resist in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions in the world are being completed in your brotherhood.
210510 But the God of all grace, He calling us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, He will perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you .
210511 To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.
210512 I wrote to you through a few words , by Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace of God in which you stand.
210513 The fellow-elected in Babylon greet you; also Mark my son.
210514 Greet one another with a kiss of holy love. Peace be to you, all those in Christ Jesus. Amen.
220101 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of our God and our Savior Jesus Christ,
220102 Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
220103 according as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who has called us to glory and virtue,
220104 through which He has given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, so that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
220105 But also in this very thing, bringing in all diligence, filling out your faith with virtue, and with virtue, knowledge;
220106 and with knowledge self-control, and with self-control, patience, and with patience, godliness,
220107 and with godliness, brotherly kindness, and with brotherly kindness, love.
220108 For if these things are in you and abound, they make you to be neither idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
220109 For he in whom these things are not present is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his sins in the past.
220110 Therefore, brothers, rather be diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you do these things, you shall never fall.
220111 For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
220112 Therefore I will not neglect to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them and are established in the present truth.
220113 But I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by a reminder,
220114 knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
220115 And I will also be diligent to cause you to always have memory of these things after my departure.
220116 For not having followed fables having been cunningly devised, but becoming eyewitnesses of the majesty of Jesus Christ, we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord.
220117 For He received honor and glory from God the Father, when was borne to Him a voice from the excellent glory, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
220118 And we heard this voice being borne from Heaven, being with Him in the holy mountain.
220119 We also have a more sure word of prophecy, to which you do well to take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the Daystar arises in your hearts,
220120 knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture came into being of its own private interpretation.
220121 For prophecy was not borne at any time by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke being borne along by the Holy Spirit.
220201 But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who secretly will bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.
220202 And many will follow their pernicious ways, and because of them the way of truth will be evil spoken of.
220203 And through covetousness they will use you for gain with well-turned words; for whom judgment from of old does not linger, and their destruction does not sleep.
220204 For if God did not spare sinning angels, but thrust them down into Tartarus, and delivered them into chains of darkness, being reserved to judgment.
220205 And He did not spare the old world, but saved Noah the eighth one, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.
220206 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, He condemned them with an overthrow, setting an example to men intending to live ungodly.
220207 And He delivered righteous Lot, oppressed with the lustful behavior of the lawless.
220208 For that righteous one living among them, in seeing and hearing, his righteous soul was tormented from day to day with their unlawful deeds.
220209 The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unjust for a day of judgment, to be punished,
220210 and especially those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise dominion. They are darers, self-pleasing; not trembling at glories, speaking evil.
220211 Where angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reproaching accusation against them before the Lord.
220212 But these, as unreasoning natural brute animals having been born for capture and corruption, speak evil of the things that they do not understand. And they will utterly perish in their own corruption,
220213 being about to receive the wages of unrighteousness, deeming indulgence as pleasure in the daytime, and reveling in spots and blemishes, feasting along with you in their deceits,
220214 having eyes full of adultery and never ceasing from sin, alluring unstable souls, having a heart exercised with covetousness. They are cursed children
220215 who have forsaken the right way and have gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,
220216 but had reproof of his lawbreaking, a dumb ass speaking in a man's voice, held back the madness of the prophet.
220217 These are wells without water, clouds driven with a tempest, for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever.
220218 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they lure through the lusts of the flesh, by unbridled lust, the ones who were escaping from those who live in error;
220219 promising them liberty, they themselves are the slaves of corruption. For by whom anyone has been overcome, even to this one he has been enslaved.
220220 For if they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and are again entangled, they have been overcome by these, their last things are worse than the first.
220221 For it would have been better for them not to have fully known the way of righteousness, than fully knowing it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
220222 But the word of the true proverb has happened to them: The dog turning to his own vomit; and, The washed sow to wallowing in the mire.
220301 Beloved, I now write this second letter to you, in which I stir up your pure mind by reminder
220302 to remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of the Lord and Savior by us, the apostles.
220303 First, knowing this, that there will come in the last days scoffers walking according to their own lusts
220304 and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.
220305 For this is hidden from them by their willing it, that the heavens were of old, and the earth out of the water, and through water, being held together by the word of God,
220306 through which the world that then was, being flooded by water, perished.
220307 But the present heavens and the earth being kept in store by the same word, are being kept for fire until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
220308 But, beloved, let not this one thing be hidden from you , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
220309 The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness, but is long-suffering toward us, not purposing that any of us should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
220310 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat. And the earth and the works in it will be burned up.
220311 Then, all these things being about to be dissolved, what sort ought you to be in holy behavior and godliness,
220312 looking for and rushing the coming of the Day of God, on account of which the heavens, being on fire, will melt away, and the elements will melt, burning with heat?
220313 But according to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.
220314 Therefore, beloved, looking for these things, be diligent, spotless, and without blemish, to be found by Him in peace.
220315 And think of the long-suffering of our Lord as salvation (as our beloved brother Paul also has written to you according to the wisdom given to him
220316 as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable pervert, as also they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction).
220317 Therefore, beloved, knowing beforehand, beware lest being led away with the error of the lawless, you fall from your own steadfastness.
220318 But grow in grace and in knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
230101 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life,
230102 (for the Life was revealed, and we have seen it and bear witness, and show to you the everlasting Life, who was with the Father and was revealed to us),
230103 that which we have seen and heard we declare unto you, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
230104 And we write these things to you so that your joy may be full.
230105 And this is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.
230106 If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
230107 But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.
230108 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
230109 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
230110 If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us.
230201 My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
230202 And He is the propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the sins of all the world.
230203 And by this we know that we have known Him, if we keep His commandments.
230204 He who says, I have known Him, and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
230205 But whoever keeps His Word, truly in this one the love of God is perfected. By this we know that we are in Him.
230206 He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk even as He walked.
230207 Brothers, I do not write a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.
230208 Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true Light now shines.
230209 He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness until now.
230210 He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no offense in him.
230211 But he who hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because darkness has blinded his eyes.
230212 I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for His name's sake.
230213 I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.
230214 I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
230215 Do not love the world, nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him,
230216 because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
230217 And the world passes away, and the lust of it, but he who does the will of God abides forever.
230218 Little children, it is the last time. And just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have risen up, from which we know that it is the last hour.
230219 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they were of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out so that it might be revealed that they were not all of us.
230220 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.
230221 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and know that no lie is of the truth.
230222 Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He who denies the Father and the Son is antichrist.
230223 Everyone who denies the Son neither has the Father. The one confessing the Son also has the Father.
230224 Therefore what you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you will abide in both the Son and in the Father.
230225 And this is the promise that He has promised us: everlasting life.
230226 These things I have written to you concerning those leading you astray.
230227 But the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true and no lie, and as He has taught you, abide in Him.
230228 And now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He is revealed, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him in His coming.
230229 If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who does righteousness has been born of Him.
230301 Behold what manner of love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God. Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
230302 Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be. But we know that when He shall be revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.
230303 And everyone who has this hope on him purifies himself, even as that One is pure.
230304 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness.
230305 And you know that He was revealed that He might take away our sins, and in Him is no sin.
230306 Everyone who abides in Him does not sin. Everyone who sins has not seen Him nor known Him.
230307 Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as that One is righteous.
230308 He who practices sin is of the Devil, for the Devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed, that He might undo the works of the Devil.
230309 Everyone who has been born of God does not commit sin, because His seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.
230310 In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the Devil: everyone not practicing righteousness is not of God, also he who does not love his brother.
230311 For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;
230312 not as Cain who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. And for what did he kill him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's things were righteous.
230313 Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you.
230314 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love his brother abides in death.
230315 Everyone hating his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has everlasting life abiding in him.
230316 By this we have known the love of God , because He laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
230317 But whoever has this world's goods and sees his brother having need, and shuts up his bowels from him, how does the love of God dwell in him?
230318 My children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.
230319 And in this we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him,
230320 that if our heart accuses us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
230321 Beloved, if our heart does not accuse us, we have confidence toward God.
230322 And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.
230323 And this is His commandment, that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as He gave us commandment.
230324 And he who keeps His commandment dwells in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit which He gave to us.
230401 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but try the spirits to see if they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
230402 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God;
230403 and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the antichrist you heard is coming, and even now is already in the world.
230404 You are of God, little children, and you have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.
230405 They are of the world, therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
230406 We are of God. He who knows God hears us. The one who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
230407 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and everyone who loves has been born of God, and knows God.
230408 The one who does not love has not known God. For God is love.
230409 In this the love of God was revealed in us, because God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might live through Him.
230410 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation concerning our sins.
230411 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
230412 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and His love is perfected in us.
230413 By this we know that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.
230414 And we have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
230415 Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him and he in God.
230416 And we have known and believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.
230417 In this is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that as He is, so also we are in this world.
230418 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has torment. He who fears has not been perfected in love.
230419 We love Him because He first loved us.
230420 If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For if he does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
230421 And we have this commandment from Him, that he who loves God should love his brother also.
230501 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. And everyone who loves Him who begets also loves him who has been born of Him.
230502 By this we know that we love the children of God, whenever we love God and keep His commandments.
230503 For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments, and His commandments are not burdensome.
230504 For everything that has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.
230505 Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
230506 This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by water only, but by the water and blood. And the Spirit is He who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
230507 For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one.
230508 And there are three that bear witness on the earth: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three are into the one.
230509 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God which He has testified about His Son.
230510 He who believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself. He who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he does not believe the record that God gave of His Son.
230511 And this is the record, that God has given to us everlasting life, and this life is in His Son.
230512 He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
230513 I have written these things to you who believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have everlasting life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.
230514 And this is the confidence that we have toward Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
230515 And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.
230516 If anyone sees his brother sin a sin not to death, he shall ask, and He shall give him life for those that do not sin to death. There is a sin to death, I do not say that he shall pray for it.
230517 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not to death.
230518 We know that everyone who has been born of God does not continue to sin, but the one born of God guards himself, and the evil one does not touch him.
230519 We know that we are of God, and all the world lies in evil.
230520 And we know that the Son of God has come, and He has given us an understanding so that we may know Him who is true. And we are in Him that is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and the everlasting life.
230521 Little children, guard yourselves from idols. Amen.
240101 The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth,
240102 for the sake of the truth dwelling in us, and which shall be with us forever.
240103 Grace will be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
240104 I rejoiced greatly that I found your children walking in truth, as we have received command from the Father.
240105 And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
240106 And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
240107 For many deceivers have entered into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the anti-christ.
240108 Look to yourselves, so that we may not lose those things which we worked out, but that we may receive a full reward.
240109 Everyone transgressing and not abiding in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son.
240110 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house, nor speak a greeting to him.
240111 For he who speaks a greeting to him is partaker of his evil deeds.
240112 Having many things to write to you, I do not want to say with paper and ink. But I trust to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be full.
240113 The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.
250101 The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in the truth.
250102 Beloved, in regard to all things I pray that you prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.
250103 For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.
250104 I have no greater joy than these things, to hear that my children walk in the truth.
250105 Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you work for the brothers and for strangers,
250106 who in love bore witness of you before the church, whom you will do well to send forward worthily of God;
250107 because they went forth for His name's sake, taking nothing from the nations.
250108 Therefore we ought to entertain such, so that we might be co-workers in the truth.
250109 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, did not receive us.
250110 Therefore if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, ranting against us with evil words. And not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brothers. And he forbids those who would, and casts them out of the church.
250111 Beloved, do not imitate the bad, but the good. He who does good is from God, but he who does evil has not seen God.
250112 Demetrius has good report by all, and by the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our witness is true.
250113 I had many things to write, but I will not write to you with pen and ink,
250114 but I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
260101 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to the ones called in God the Father, having been set apart, and having been kept by Jesus Christ:
260102 Mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.
260103 Having made all haste to write to you about the common salvation, beloved, I had need to write to you to exhort you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.
260104 For certain men crept in secretly, those having been of old previously written into this condemnation, ungodly ones perverting the grace of our God for unbridled lust, and denying the only Master, God, even our Lord Jesus Christ.
260105 But I intend to remind you, you once knowing these things, that the Lord having delivered a people out of the land of Egypt, in the second place destroyed the ones not believing.
260106 And those angels not having kept their first place, but having deserted their dwelling-place, He has kept in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of a great Day;
260107 as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, in like manner to these, committing fornication, and going away after other flesh, laid down an example before-times, undergoing vengeance of everlasting fire.
260108 Likewise, indeed, also these dreaming ones even defile flesh, and despise rulership, and speak evil of glories.
260109 But Michael, the archangel, when contending with the Devil, he argued about the body of Moses, he dared not bring a judgment of blasphemy, but said, Let the Lord rebuke you!
260110 But what things they do not know, they speak evil of. And what things they understand naturally, like the animals without reason, they are corrupted by these.
260111 Woe to them! For they went the way of Cain, and gave themselves up to the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.
260112 These are sunken rocks in your love feasts, feasting together with you; feeding themselves without fear; waterless clouds being carried about by winds; fruitless autumn trees, having died twice, having been plucked up by the roots;
260113 wild waves of the sea foaming up their shames; wandering stars for whom blackness of darkness has been kept forever.
260114 And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied to these, saying, Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints,
260115 to do judgment against all, and to rebuke all the ungodly of them concerning all their ungodly works which they ungodly did, and concerning all the hard things ungodly sinners spoke against Him.
260116 These are murmurers, complainers, leading lives according to their lusts. And their mouth speaks proud things, admiring faces for the sake of gain.
260117 But you, beloved, remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
260118 because they told you that at the last time there will be mockers according to their lusts, leading ungodly lives.
260119 These are those setting themselves apart, animal-like ones, not having the Spirit.
260120 But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
260121 keep yourselves in the love of God, eagerly awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to everlasting life.
260122 But pity some, making distinction.
260123 But save others with fear, snatching them out of the fire; hating even the garment having been stained from the flesh.
260124 Now to Him being able to keep you without stumbling, and to set you before His glory without blemish, with unspeakable joy;
260125 to the only wise God, our Savior, be glory and majesty and might and authority, even now and forever. Amen.
270101 A Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to Him to declare to His servants things which must shortly come to pass. And He signified it by sending His angel to His servant John,
270102 who bore record of the Word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the things that he saw.
270103 Blessed is the one who reads and hears the words of this prophecy, and the ones keeping the things written in it, for the time is near.
270104 John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming; and from the seven spirits which are before His throne;
270105 even from Jesus Christ the faithful Witness, the First-born from the dead and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,
270106 and made us kings and priests to God and His Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
270107 Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, and those who pierced Him will see Him, and all the kindreds of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.
270108 I am the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.
270109 I, John, who also am your brother and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island that is called Patmos, for the Word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
270110 I came to be in the Spirit in the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
270111 saying, I am the Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last. Also, What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
270112 And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.
270113 And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands. And in the midst of the seven lampstands I saw One like the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and tied around the breast with a golden band.
270114 His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow. And His eyes were like a flame of fire.
270115 And His feet were like burnished brass having been fired in a furnace. And His voice was like the sound of many waters.
270116 And He had seven stars in His right hand, and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. And His face was like the sun shining in its strength.
270117 And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand upon me, saying to me, Do not fear, I am the First and the Last,
270118 and the Living One, and I became dead, and behold, I am alive for ever and ever, Amen. And I have the keys of hell and of death.
270119 Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be after this,
270120 the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.
270201 To the angel of the church of Ephesus write: He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, says these things.
270202 I know your works and your labor and your patience, and how you cannot bear those who are evil. And you tried those pretending to be apostles, and are not, and have found them liars.
270203 And you have borne, and have patience, and for My name's sake you have labored and have not fainted.
270204 But I have against you that you left your first love.
270205 Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and will remove your lampstand out of its place unless you repent.
270206 But you have this, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
270207 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
270208 And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: The First and the Last, who became dead and lived, says these things:
270209 I know your works and tribulation and poverty (but you are rich), and I know the blasphemy of those saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
270210 Do not at all fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the Devil will cast some of you into prison, so that you may be tried. And you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.
270211 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.
270212 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write: He who has the sharp sword with two edges says these things.
270213 I know your works, and where you live, even where Satan's seat is . And you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in those days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.
270214 But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication.
270215 So you also have those who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.
270216 Repent! But if not I will come to you quickly, and will fight with them by the sword of My mouth.
270217 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give to him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows except he who receives it .
270218 And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: The Son of God, He who has His eyes like a flame of fire and His feet like burnished metal, says these things:
270219 I know your works and love and service and faith and your patience, and your works; and the last to be more than the first.
270220 But I have a few things against you because you allow that woman Jezebel to teach, she saying herself to be a prophetess, and to cause My servants to go astray, and to commit fornication, and to eat idol-sacrifices.
270221 And I gave her time that she might repent of her fornication, and she did not repent.
270222 Behold, I am throwing her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent of their deeds.
270223 And I will kill her children with death. And all the churches will know that I am He who searches the reins and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works.
270224 But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will put on you no other burden.
270225 But that which you have, hold fast until I come.
270226 And he who overcomes and keeps My works to the end, to him I will give power over the nations.
270227 And he will rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of a potter they will be broken to pieces, even as I received from My Father.
270228 And I will give him the Morning Star.
270229 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
270301 And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars says these things. I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.
270302 Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die. For I have not found your works being fulfilled before God.
270303 Remember then how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.
270304 You have a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments. And they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.
270305 The one who overcomes, this one will be clothed in white clothing. And I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life, but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.
270306 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
270307 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts; and shuts and no one opens, says these things:
270308 I know your works. Behold, I have given before you an open door, and no one can shut it. For you have a little strength and have kept My word and have not denied My name.
270309 Behold, I give out of those of the synagogue of Satan, those saying themselves to be Jews and are not, but lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.
270310 Because you have kept the word of My patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation which will come upon all the habitable world, to try those who dwell upon the earth.
270311 Behold, I come quickly. Hold fast to that which you have, so that no one may take your crown.
270312 Him who overcomes I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will go out no more. And I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of Heaven from My God, and My new name.
270313 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
270314 And to the angel of the church of the Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Head of the creation of God, says these things:
270315 I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were cold or hot.
270316 So because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.
270317 Because you say, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,
270318 I counsel you to buy from Me gold purified by fire, so that you may be rich; and white clothing, so that you may be clothed, and so that the shame of your nakedness does not appear. And anoint your eyes with eye salve, so that you may see.
270319 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; therefore be zealous and repent.
270320 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him and he with Me.
270321 To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame and have sat down with My Father in His throne.
270322 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
270401 After these things I looked, and behold, a door was opened in Heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you what must occur after these things.
270402 And immediately I became in spirit. And behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and One sat upon the throne.
270403 And He who sat there looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. And a rainbow was around the throne, looking like an emerald.
270404 And around the throne I saw twenty-four thrones. And on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white clothing. And they had crowns of gold on their heads.
270405 And out of the throne came lightnings and thunderings and voices. And seven lamps of fire were burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.
270406 And a sea of glass was in front of the throne, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.
270407 And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle.
270408 And each one of the four living creatures had six wings about him , and within being full of eyes. And they had no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
270409 And whenever the living creatures gave glory and honor and thanks to Him who sat on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
270410 the twenty-four elders fell down before the One sitting on the throne. And they worshiped Him who lives for ever and ever, and threw their crowns before the throne, saying,
270411 O Lord, You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power, because You created all things, and for Your will they are and were created.
270501 And I saw a book on the right of Him sitting on the throne, written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
270502 And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loosen its seals?
270503 And no one in Heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book or to look at it.
270504 And I wept very much, because no one was found worthy to open and to read the book, nor to look at it.
270505 And one of the elders said to me, Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals of it.
270506 And I looked, and lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, amidst the elders, a Lamb stood, as if it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
270507 And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him sitting on the throne.
270508 And when He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having harps and golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
270509 And they sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book and to open its seals, for You were slain and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation.
270510 And You made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign over the earth.
270511 And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and the living creatures and the elders. And the number of them was myriads and myriads, and thousands of thousands,
270512 saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.
270513 And I heard every creature which is in the Heaven and on the earth, and under the earth, and those that are in the sea, and all who are in them, saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever.
270514 And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped the One living forever and ever.
270601 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures like a sound of thunder, saying, Come and see.
270602 And I saw. And behold a white horse! And he sitting on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.
270603 And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, Come and see.
270604 And another, a red horse, went out. And power was given to him sitting on it, to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. And there was given to him a great sword.
270605 And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. And I looked, and lo, a black horse. And he sitting on it had a balance in his hand.
270606 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say, A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius. And do not hurt the oil and the wine.
270607 And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come and see.
270608 And I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him sitting on it was Death, and Hell followed with him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and by the beasts of the earth.
270609 And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.
270610 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Until when, Master, holy and true, do You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?
270611 And white robes were given to each one of them. And it was said to them that they should rest yet for a little time, until both their fellow servants and their brothers (those about to be killed as they were ) should have their number made complete.
270612 And when He had opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great earthquake. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.
270613 And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind.
270614 And the heaven departed like a scroll when it is rolled together. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
270615 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains.
270616 And they said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;
270617 for the great day of His wrath has come, and who will be able to stand?
270701 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth so that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
270702 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
270703 saying, Do not hurt the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
270704 And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousands, having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel.
270705 Out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand had been sealed.
270706 Out of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand had been sealed.
270707 Out of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand had been sealed.
270708 Out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand had been sealed.
270709 After these things I looked, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues, stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palms in their hands.
270710 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb.
270711 And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures, and they fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped God,
270712 saying, Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
270713 And one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these who are arrayed in white robes, and from where do they come?
270714 And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are the ones who came out of the great tribulation and have washed their robes, and have whitened them in the blood of the Lamb.
270715 Therefore they are before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His temple. And He sitting on the throne will dwell among them.
270716 They will not hunger any more, nor thirst any more, nor will the sun light on them, nor any heat.
270717 For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will feed them and will lead them to the fountains of living waters. And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.
270801 And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in Heaven for about half an hour.
270802 And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
270803 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer. And many incenses were given to him, so that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar before the throne.
270804 And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God from the angel's hand.
270805 And the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar, and cast it into the earth. And voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake occurred.
270806 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
270807 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were cast on the earth. And the third part of trees was burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
270808 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood.
270809 And the third part of the creatures in the sea, those having souls, died; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.
270810 And the third angel sounded, and a great star burning like a lamp fell from the heaven, and it fell on the third part of the rivers and on the fountains of waters.
270811 And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and a third part of the waters became wormwood. And many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
270812 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was stricken, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day did not appear for a third part of it, and the night also.
270813 And I saw and I heard one angel flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three angels being about to sound!
270901 And the fifth angel sounded. And I saw a star fall from the heaven to the earth, and it was given the key of the abyss.
270902 And it opened the bottomless pit. And there arose a smoke out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.
270903 And out of the smoke came forth locusts onto the earth. And authority was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have authority.
270904 And they were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads.
270905 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months. And their torment was like a scorpion's torment when he stings a man.
270906 And in those days men will seek death and will not find it. And they will long to die, and death will flee from them.
270907 And the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle. And on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
270908 And they had hairs like the hairs of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.
270909 And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron. And the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
270910 And they had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. And their authority was to hurt men five months.
270911 And they had a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in Greek his name is Apollyon.
270912 The first woe is past. Behold, after these things yet come two woes.
270913 And the sixth angel sounded his trumpet. And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,
270914 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.
270915 And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, in order to slay the third part of men.
270916 And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two myriads of myriads. And I heard their number.
270917 And so I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them, having breastplates of fire, even dusky red and brimstone. And the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions. And out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
270918 By these three the third part of men was killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths.
270919 For their authority is in their mouth and in their tails. For their tails were like serpents with heads, and with them they do harm.
270920 And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and golden, and silver, and bronze, and stone, and wooden idols (which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk).
270921 And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
271001 And I saw another mighty angel coming down out of the heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.
271002 And he had a little book open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth.
271003 And he cried with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. And when he had cried, seven thunders spoke their sounds.
271004 And when the seven thunders spoke their sounds, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Seal up what things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write these things.
271005 And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the earth lifted his hand to the heaven,
271006 and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there should no longer be time.
271007 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he will begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as He has declared to His servants the prophets.
271008 And the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.
271009 And I went to the angel and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take it and eat it up, and it will make your belly bitter, but it will be sweet as honey in your mouth.
271010 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was sweet as honey in my mouth, and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.
271011 And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.
271101 And a reed like a rod was given to me. And the angel stood, saying, Rise up and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship in it.
271102 But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it was given to the nations. And they will trample the holy city forty-two months.
271103 And I will give power to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
271104 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.
271105 And if anyone will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone will hurt them, so it is right for him to be killed.
271106 These have authority to shut up the heaven, that it may not rain in the days of their prophecy. And they have authority over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.
271107 And when they complete their testimony, the beast coming up out of the abyss will make war against them and will overcome them and kill them.
271108 And their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
271109 And many of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will see their dead bodies three days and a half, and they will not allow their dead bodies to be put in tombs.
271110 And the ones who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, and will make merry, and will send one another gifts, because these two prophets tormented those living on the earth.
271111 And after three days and a half, a spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. And great fear fell on those seeing them.
271112 And they heard a great voice from Heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up to Heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
271113 And in that hour a great earthquake occurred, and the tenth part of the city fell. And seven thousand names of men were slain in the earthquake. And the rest were frightened and gave glory to the God of Heaven.
271114 The second woe passed away. Behold, the third woe comes quickly.
271115 And the seventh angel sounded. And there were great voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ. And He will reign forever and ever.
271116 And the twenty-four elders sitting before God on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
271117 saying, We thank You, O Lord God Almighty, who are, and who was, and who is coming, because You took Your great power and reigned.
271118 And the nations were full of wrath, and Your wrath came, and the time of the judging of the dead, and to give the reward to Your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to the ones fearing Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those destroying the earth.
271119 And the temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His covenant, and there occurred lightnings and voices, and thunders and an earthquake, and a great hail.
271201 And there appeared a great sign in the heavens, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon was under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head,
271202 and having a babe in womb, she cries, being in travail, having been distressed to bear.
271203 And another sign was seen in the heavens. And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads!
271204 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them onto the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman being about to bear, so that when she bears he might devour her child.
271205 And she bore a son, a male, who is going to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught up to God and to His throne.
271206 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, so that they might nourish her there a thousand, two hundred and sixty days.
271207 And there was war in Heaven. Michael and his angels warring against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels warred,
271208 but did not prevail. Nor was place found for them in Heaven any more.
271209 And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent called Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
271210 And I heard a great voice saying in Heaven, Now has come the salvation and power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ. For the accuser of our brothers is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.
271211 And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony. And they did not love their soul until death.
271212 Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and those tabernacling in them. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and in the sea! For the Devil came down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a little time.
271213 And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who bore the man child .
271214 And two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, so that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the serpent's face.
271215 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water like a flood after the woman, so that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.
271216 And the earth helped the woman. And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
271217 And the dragon was enraged over the woman, and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
271301 And I stood on the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns. And on its horns were ten crowns, and on its heads was the name of blasphemy.
271302 And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and its feet like those of a bear, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him its power and its seat and great authority.
271303 And I saw one of its heads as having been slain to death, and its deadly wound was healed. And all the earth marveled after the beast.
271304 And they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast. And they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with it?
271305 And a mouth speaking great things was given to it, and blasphemies. And authority was given to it to continue forty-two months.
271306 And it opened its mouth in blasphemy toward God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, and those dwelling in Heaven.
271307 And it was given to it to war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given to it over every tribe and tongue and nation.
271308 And all dwelling on the earth will worship it, those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain, from the foundation of the world.
271309 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
271310 He who leads into captivity will go into captivity. If anyone will kill with the sword, he must be killed by a sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
271311 And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. And it had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.
271312 And it exercises all the authority of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and those dwelling in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
271313 And it does great wonders, so that it makes fire come down from the heaven onto the earth in the sight of men.
271314 And it deceives those dwelling on the earth, because of the miracles which were given to it to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling on the earth that they should make an image to the beast who had the wound by a sword and lived.
271315 And there was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might both speak, and might cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
271316 And it causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark on their right hand, or in their foreheads,
271317 even that not any might buy or sell except those having the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of its name.
271318 Here is the wisdom. Let him having reason count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. And its number is six hundred and sixty-six.
271401 And I looked, and lo, the Lamb stood on Mount Zion. And with Him were a hundred and forty-four thousands, having His Father's name written in their foreheads.
271402 And I heard a voice from Heaven, like the voice of many waters and like the voice of a great thunder. And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.
271403 And they sang as it were a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. And no one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousands who were redeemed from the earth.
271404 These are those who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from among men, as a firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.
271405 And in their mouth was found no guile, for they were without blemish before the throne of God.
271406 And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and kindred and tongue and people,
271407 saying with a great voice, Fear God and give glory to Him! For the hour of His judgment has come. And worship Him who made the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
271408 And another angel followed, saying, The great city, Babylon, has fallen, has fallen; because of the wine of the anger of her fornication; she has made all nations to drink.
271409 And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark in his forehead or in his hand,
271410 he also will drink of the wine of the anger of God, having been mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath. And he will be tormented by fire and brimstone before the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.
271411 And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. And they have no rest day or night, those who worship the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.
271412 Here is the patience of the saints. Here are the ones who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
271413 And I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they shall rest from their labors, and their works follow them.
271414 And I looked, and behold, a white cloud. And on the cloud sat one like the Son of man, having a golden crown on His head, and a sharp sickle in His hand.
271415 And another angel came out of the temple, crying in a great voice to Him sitting on the cloud, Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth was dried.
271416 And He sitting on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
271417 And another angel came out of the temple in Heaven, also having a sharp sickle.
271418 And another angel came out from the altar, who had authority over fire. And he spoke with a great cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.
271419 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the anger of God.
271420 And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, for the space of a thousand, six hundred stadia.
271501 And I saw another sign in Heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels with the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.
271502 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire. And those who had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
271503 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty, just and true are Your ways, O King of saints.
271504 Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You only are holy. For all nations shall come and worship before You, for Your righteousnesses were made known.
271505 And after these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in Heaven.
271506 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and were tied at the breasts with golden bands.
271507 And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
271508 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from His authority. And no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
271601 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the vials of the anger of God on the earth.
271602 And the first went and poured out his vial on the earth. And a bad and grievous sore fell on the men who had the mark of the beast, and on those who worshiped his image.
271603 And the second angel poured out his vial on the sea. And it became like the blood of a dead one, and every living soul died in the sea.
271604 And the third angel poured out his vial on the rivers and fountains of waters, and they became blood.
271605 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Righteous is the Lord, who is, and was, and who will be, because You have judged these things,
271606 since they have poured out the blood of the saints and prophets; and You gave them blood to drink, for they were deserving.
271607 And I heard another out of the altar saying, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.
271608 And the fourth angel poured out his vial onto the sun. And it was given to him to burn men with fire.
271609 And men were burned with great heat. And they blasphemed the name of God, He having authority over these plagues. And they did not repent in order to give Him glory.
271610 And the fifth angel poured out his vial on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom became darkened. And they gnawed their tongues from the pain.
271611 And they blasphemed the God of Heaven because of their pains and their sores. And they did not repent of their deeds.
271612 And the sixth angel poured out his vial on the great river Euphrates. And its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared.
271613 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
271614 For they are spirits of demons, working miracles, which go forth to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that day, the great day of God Almighty.
271615 Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is the one who watches and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.
271616 And he gathered them into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
271617 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air. And a great voice came out of the temple of Heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done!
271618 And voices and thunders and lightnings occurred. And there was a great earthquake, such as has not been since men were on the earth, so mighty and so great an earthquake.
271619 And the great city came to be into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Babylon was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the anger of His wrath.
271620 And every island fled away, and mountains were not found.
271621 And a great hail, as the size of a talent, came down out of the heaven on men. And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague of it was exceedingly great.
271701 And one of the seven angels who had the seven vials came and talked with me, saying to me, Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot sitting on many waters,
271702 with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and became drunk with the wine of her fornication, those inhabiting the earth.
271703 And he carried me away into a desert by the Spirit. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored beast, filled with names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
271704 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet. And she was gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.
271705 And on her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
271706 And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with a great marveling.
271707 And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, that has the seven heads and ten horns.
271708 The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend out of the abyss and go into perdition. And those dwelling on the earth will marvel, those whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
271709 And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.
271710 And there are seven kings; five have fallen, and one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must continue a short time.
271711 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.
271712 And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom yet, but will receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.
271713 These have one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.
271714 These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them. For He is Lord of lords and King of kings. And those with Him are the called and elect and faithful ones.
271715 And he says to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues,
271716 and the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked. And they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
271717 For God gave into their hearts to do His mind, and to act with one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God will be fulfilled.
271718 And the woman whom you saw is the great city which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.
271801 And after these things I saw another angel come down from Heaven, having great authority. And the earth was lighted up from his glory.
271802 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen! And it has become the dwelling-place of demons, and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean bird which has been hated,
271803 because of the wine of the anger of her fornication which all the nations have drunk. And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. And the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her luxury.
271804 And I heard another voice from Heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that you may not be partakers of her sins, and that you may not receive of her plagues.
271805 For her sins joined together, even up to Heaven, and God has remembered her unjust deeds.
271806 Reward her as she has rewarded you, and double to her double, according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix double to her.
271807 As much as she has glorified herself and has lived in luxury, so much torment and sorrow give her. For she says in her heart, I sit as a queen, and I am not a widow; and I do not see mourning at all.
271808 Therefore her plagues will come in one day, death and mourning and famine. And she will be consumed with fire, for the Lord God who judges her is strong.
271809 And the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived in luxury with her will weep for her, and will wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning;
271810 standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, Babylon, that strong city! For in one hour your judgment came.
271811 And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their cargo any more;
271812 the cargo of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of very precious wood, and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble,
271813 and cinnamon, and incenses, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
271814 And the fruits of the lust of your soul have departed from you, and all the fat things and the bright things departed from you, and you will find them no more, not at all.
271815 The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning
271816 and saying, Woe! Woe to the great city which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!
271817 For in one hour such great riches was desolated. And every ship-pilot, and all the company on the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, stood afar off.
271818 And they cried out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like the great city?
271819 And they threw dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, by which all who had ships in the sea were rich out of her costliness! For in one hour she was ruined.
271820 Rejoice over her, Heaven, and the holy apostles, and the prophets, since God judged your judgment on her.
271821 And one strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, So on an impulse the great city, Babylon, will be thrown down and not at all will be found any more.
271822 And the voice of harpers, and of musicians. and flutists, and of trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. And every craftsman of any craft will not be found any more in you. And the sound of a mill will never more be heard at all in you.
271823 And the light of a lamp will never more shine at all in you. And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will never more be heard at all in you. For your merchants were the great ones of the earth; for by your sorceries all nations were deceived.
271824 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all those who were slain on the earth.
271901 And after these things I heard a great sound of a numerous crowd in Heaven, saying, Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and honor and the power to the Lord our God!
271902 For true and righteous are His judgments. For He has judged the great harlot who defiled the earth with her fornication, and He has avenged the blood of His servants out of her hand.
271903 And secondly they said, Hallelujah! And her smoke rose up forever and ever.
271904 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God sitting on the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah!
271905 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His servants, and the ones fearing Him, the small and great.
271906 And I heard as the sound of a great multitude, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah! For the Lord God omnipotent reigns!
271907 Let us be glad and rejoice and we will give glory to Him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has prepared herself.
271908 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.
271909 And he said to me, Write, Blessed are those who have been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.
271910 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See, do not do it! I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
271911 And I saw Heaven opened. And behold, a white horse! And He sitting on him was called Faithful and True. And in righteousness He judges and makes war.
271912 And His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head many crowns. And He had a name written, one that no one knew except Himself.
271913 And He had been clothed in a garment dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.
271914 And the armies in Heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
271915 And out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, so that with it He should strike the nations. And He will shepherd them with a rod of iron. And He treads the winepress of the wine of the anger and of the wrath of Almighty God.
271916 And He has on His garment, and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
271917 And I saw one angel standing in the sun. And he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come and gather together to the supper of the great God,
271918 so that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of strong ones, and the flesh of horses, and those sitting on them, and the flesh of all, both free and slave, both small and great.
271919 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth and their armies, being gathered to make war against Him who sat on the horse, and against His army.
271920 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet doing signs before it, (by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast), and those who had worshiped his image. The two were thrown alive into the Lake of Fire burning with brimstone.
271921 And the rest were slain by the sword of Him who sat on the horse, it proceeding out of His mouth. And all the birds were filled from their flesh.
272001 And I saw an angel come down from Heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
272002 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.
272003 And he cast him into the abyss and shut him up and set a seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more until the thousand years should be fulfilled. And after that he must be loosed a little time.
272004 And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the Word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast nor his image, nor had received his mark on their foreheads, nor in their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
272005 But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
272006 Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. The second death has no authority over these, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with Him a thousand years.
272007 And when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be loosed out of his prison.
272008 And he will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle. The number of them is as the sand of the sea.
272009 And they went up over the breadth of the earth and circled around the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of Heaven and devoured them.
272010 And the Devil who deceived them was cast into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet were . And he will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
272011 And I saw a great white throne, and Him sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And a place was not found for them.
272012 And I saw the dead, the small and the great, stand before God. And books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
272013 And the sea gave up the dead in it. And death and hell delivered up the dead in them. And each one of them was judged according to their works.
272014 And death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire. This is the second death.
272015 And if anyone was not found having been written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the Lake of Fire.
272101 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. And the sea no longer is.
272102 And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her Husband.
272103 And I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
272104 And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there will be no more death, nor mourning, nor crying out, nor will there be any more pain; for the first things passed away.
272105 And He sitting on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said to me, Write, for these words are true and faithful.
272106 And He said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who thirsts I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.
272107 He who overcomes will inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he will be My son.
272108 But the fearful, and the unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, will have their part in the Lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
272109 And one of the seven angels who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.
272110 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of Heaven from God,
272111 having the glory of God. And its light was like a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.
272112 And it had a great and high wall, with twelve gates. And on the gates were twelve angels, and having names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:
272113 From the east three gates, from the north three gates, from the south three gates, and from the west three gates.
272114 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
272115 And he who talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and its gates and its wall.
272116 And the city lies four-square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand stadia. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
272117 And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.
272118 And the foundation of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.
272119 And the foundations of the wall of the city had been adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
272120 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
272121 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls. Respectively, each one of the gates was one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.
272122 And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, even the Lamb.
272123 And the city had no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they might shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
272124 And the nations of those who are saved will walk in the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.
272125 And its gates may not be shut at all by day, for there shall be no night there.
272126 And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
272127 And there shall in no way enter into it anything that defiles, or any making an abomination or a lie; but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.
272201 And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
272202 In the midst of its street, and of the river, from here and from there, was the Tree of Life, which bore twelve fruits, each yielding its fruit according to one month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
272203 And every curse will no longer be; but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His servants will serve Him.
272204 And they will see His face, and His name will be in their foreheads.
272205 And there will be no night there. And they need no lamp, or light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light. And they will reign forever and ever.
272206 And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show to His servants the things which must shortly be done.
272207 Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this Book.
272208 And I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel showing me these things.
272209 Then he said to me, Behold! See, do not do it! For I am your fellow-servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this Book. Do worship to God.
272210 And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this Book; for the time is at hand.
272211 He acting unjustly, let him still act unjustly. And the filthy, let him be filthy still. And the righteous, let him be righteous still. And the holy, let him be holy still.
272212 And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to each according as his work is.
272213 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last.
272214 Blessed are they who do His commandments, that their authority will be over the Tree of Life, and they may enter in by the gates into the city.
272215 But outside are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and makes a lie.
272216 I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify these things to you over the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright and Morning Star.
272217 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let the one hearing say, Come! And let the one who is thirsty come. And he willing, let him take of the water of life freely.
272218 For I testify together to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add on him the plagues that have been written in this Book.
272219 And if anyone takes away from the words of the Book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which have been written in this Book.
272220 He who testifies these things says, Yes, I am coming quickly, Amen. Yes, come, Lord Jesus.
272221 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
